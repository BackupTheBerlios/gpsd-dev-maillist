&gt;<i> situation.  The commits I had locally in master were also in
</I>&gt;<i> origin/master, but not identical in sha1.  I think that's because I
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes have local commits not yet pushed and do
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    git pull
</I>&gt;<i>    git rebase origin/master
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of vanishing commits and forced-update of origin/master,
</I>&gt;<i> that would treat the public history (those 68 missing commits) as mine
</I>&gt;<i> and rebase it, removing the merge commits that happened because others
</I>&gt;<i> didn't rebase (hi esr).
</I>&gt;<i>

I think you should tweak your process somewhat to avoid this?

In general the best practice with git is to make use of it's powerful 
branching to effectively use branches as a way to &quot;stash patches&quot; and 
give those patches a name

So, in general, never ever work locally in master....

Instead keep master tracking upstream identically.  Branch master and 
fiddle around with some development stuff.  If you feel like it branch 
again and again whatever.  Once you have some commits you feel like 
keeping and pushing upstream you get those in a branch of their own (2 
ways, either branch master and then use &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; to pull in 
those commits, or rebase some branch against master).  Finally perhaps a 
rebase against master for safety and then push your commits.  If you 
want to push to master then obviously you switch back to master and 
merge in the other branch

I think if you do this then the key thing is that you always rebase 
against the same as the master repo.  I *think* what you are doing right 
now is rebasing in a way which effectively means you are working against 
a different tree to upstream?  This is almost certainly going to bite 
you at some point?  Rebasing is clever, but can cause problems - eg 
sounds like you are rebasing your master tree in such a way that you are 
re-ordering commits in your local tree that are already set in stone in 
the upstream tree? This ripples through your local tree and means your 
local commits are significantly deviating and probably it's only luck 
and coincidence your new commits don't conflict when you try and push 
them upstream?

Anyway, just a suggestion.  If nothing else take away the suggestion 
never to work in master and keep it a copy of upstream?

Good luck
