<PRE>Hi all!

Sorry i did not get the chance to come back to you sooner about this
input buffering bug and the fix esr committed the day i left...

These were great holidays!
It started in an usual way, as we sea-rescued a Greek lady the first
day who had drifted for hours on her small inflatable boat because of
a strong Meltem wind and, i suppose, a bit of a nap...
Greece definitely is a great place to sail and visit altogether. One
downside: Greeks people seem embarked in an ambitious, longstanding
and successful project which appears to consist, as far as a tourist
can tell, in replacing all sea fish with plastic bags (labeled with
greek writing, in case you're wondering where they come from). At
least there are still fish somewhere: in the sea-food restaurants.

But let's get back to our business!
The good news is: the main bug has disappeared. Gpsd isn't
continuously drifting behind anymore when faced with multi-packets
inputs.
The bad news is: there still is a bug, afaict. Now gpsd is
consistently lagging one GPS tick (i.e. one multi-packets input)
behind.

Let's give more details: as you may remember, my GPS device is
updating location data every 5s (what i call a GPS tick), which are
translated into a bundle of corresponding NMEA sentences sent to gpsd
(via bluetooth).
I must say that i got lazy, and limited myself to xgps observations:
xgps time is always exactly 5s (one tick) behind the GPS time
displayed on my device. If i simply &quot;cat /dev/rfcomm0&quot;, incoming NMEA
sentences time show no lag at all.

An xgps observation is kind of a weak proof for such a bug: it might
come from something else than a gpsd-core bug related to input
buffering (let's cross fingers).
However, i remember feeling surprised at how esr fixed this when he
explained it to me on IRC. Although i don't remember the details, the
surprise was about being able to empty the input buffer without
changing a core (function?) logic which, according to me, was
necessary to avoid this kind of behavior. It might (rightly so) sound
like a weak argument to you, yet it's enough for me to suspect this is
a core-gpsd bug (i'd love to be proven wrong).

In case you're just as lazy as i am and want to observe this yourself
before digging into the code, i attached a Java MIDlet of the
application i'm using to showcase this problem. It will transform any
GPS-enabled device with J2ME support (typically: a smart-phone) in a
Bluetooth NMEA GPS.
It can be installed on your phone like any other J2ME application.
It can handle multiple clients in case you want to cat its output and
use gpsd at the same time (although RFCOMM only support one connection
between any 2 devices, so you might need 2 client machines for this).
You should not need to do that though as it can also display the NMEA
sentences sent on the phone display.
Note: this is a modified version where the GPS tick is set to 10s, so
you have plenty of time to look at the different screens and notice a
lag.


Cheers,

-- 
Olivier
