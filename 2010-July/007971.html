We don't actually know.  But, it seems more likely that the machine was
restored from backup than that we had a master-pointer hiccup.  git is
normally configured to deny &quot;non-fast-forward&quot; pushes.  That means
normally when you push to master, the new value has to be a commit from
which the current value of master is reachable.

&gt;<i> Is there anyway to git give to cough up a history of what master points

</I>
On a normal repository, do &quot;git reflog&quot;.  (This is safe; it just prints
out stuff.)  Also, look at .git/logs/refs/heads/master or perhaps
equivalently do 'git reflog show master'.

But, on bare repositories, reference history is not kept.  I have seen
someone configure keeping a reflog on an official/bare repository, and
it doesn't seem to cause trouble.

In my case, this was still hard to figure out, and it won't tell me if
the commits are gone from the remote repo or if they just weren't
pointed to.  The way to tell would have been to view them by sha1 on
berlios before you pushed.  But it doesn't really matter.
