That's a patch for the NMEA driver, with gpsd you would be using 
SHM+ATOM drivers which works well.

That's fine, but with the ntpd ATOM driver you will probably have better
results as there will be no loss in resolution.

&gt;<i> &gt; I've filed a request in ntp bugzilla to extend the SHM protocol for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nanoseconds, but so far it was ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have noticed the same limitation.  If you give me the bug number I

It's <A HREF="https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232,">https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232,</A> I see you have already
found it. :)

&gt;<i> From the data I see I can expect short term stability
</I>&gt;<i> better than 1uSec with that addition.  As ckeuthe mentioned early, that
</I>&gt;<i> is way past that needed for any practical application, but fun.

With GPS 18x LVC I'm getting about 1us jitter for raw PPS signal,
about 200ns jitter after median filtering at poll 4 and the tracking
offsets reported by chrony usually stay around 100 ns.

Some LinuxPPS users reported that the raw jitter is around 1 us even
with receivers rated to 50 ns, so it seems there is a limitation in
interrupt handling in the kernel. I think there was a discussion about
some low latency patches which may improve this.

&gt;<i> &gt; Chrony has a SOCK driver which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't have this limitation, would you be interested in adding a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support for it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure.  Send patches.  Chrony seems to be where the action is lately.
</I>
Ok, what would be the preferred way to configure the path to the unix
domain sockets? A configure option with default to say
/var/run/gpsd.chrony.sock{0,1}, gpsd option or an environment
variable?
