OK. I've seen gpsd/cgps flashing between extended and truncated week
number. By making message 7 the authoritative source of week number,
the problem goes away. I'll look  into not screwing that up. :)

I was musing that it might be nice to have the software version
reported every so often. But it's not really good for anything. Well,
that's not quite true. We use it to decide whether to stay in SiRF
binary mode. Perhaps if we cached the version, we could make that be
part of the response to the &quot;I&quot; command?

If I could schedule an almanac/ephemeris dump, I would. Alas, the
firmware only lets you poll them - unless you're brave and parse them
out of the 50bps data stream.

Change recommended: make it possible to consume this data over the
wire. Either poll for it or don't disable it if the receiver is
already safely sending it. gpsd might not use it internally, but it
should pass raw data along if a client app signals that it would like
that data.

&gt;<i> OK, but under what circumstances are you recommending we turn on
</I>&gt;<i> tracker mode?
</I>
Given the port speed required to support tracker mode: when the user
requests it. And consider not disabling it if the the port is already
running fast enough?

&gt;<i> I'm missing context here.  Where and when did a &quot;toggle chattiness&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> command come up?
</I>
I was thinking aloud. Trying to take off the gpsd developer hat - as a
user, I am annoyed by any software that unnecessarily reconfigures my
hardware without giving me a chance to prevent that reconfiguration or
undo it. It seems bluetooth users would agree with me. :P Just reading
over my protocol references again to see if it's possible to fully
describe the device's configuration, and then to restore it.

We already allow a switch from NMEA to vendor binary - some things
just aren't available in NMEA. It doesn't seem like and unreasonable
step to then say: &quot;give me everything the gps can tell me. I know what
I'm doing&quot;

For some receivers, switching to binary mode pretty much requires a
speed switch. I haven't added it up exactly, but I think it's barely
possible to run iTalk at 38400, and Fastrax recommends that you run at
least 115200. And I don't know enough about the protocol and the
hardware yet to say what messages can be configured and how to make
that change reversible.

Yay for interesting design discussions!
