BASIC was invented more than 10 years before 1982.  1964 to be exact.
When it was invented, at Dartmouth, it was structured!  M$ basic was
released in the mid '70s.  It was the first, and last, thing Bill Gates
ever coded.  Your ZX took after the already broken M$ version.

The wikipedia article can give you more of the history, but Darmouth
BASIC, as designed in 1064, had IF, THEN, FOR and more.

I hear about this all the time because I have a brother that was an
Engineering major there in the late '60s and he rants on this all the
time.
