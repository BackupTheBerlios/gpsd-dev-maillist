<PRE>Remco Treffkorn &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">remco at rvt.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> If you want to use 'GoTo' just be honest, and do it.  Abusing a

</I>&gt;<i> is just cheating.
</I>
In Gary's defense, he told me he was emulating something somebody else
did to process Evermore packets.  He evidently believed that the fact
it had been let slip by meant it was an acceptable or approved coding
practice.  Gary shouldn't be gigged too hard for attempting to emulate
what he thought was the house style.

The fault is partly mine for not paying enough attention to that
particular dusty corner.  I should have noticed that the Evermore code
was a mess before Gary was misled by it, as packet.c is very clearly
my responsibility.

I have in fact unsnarled all three abuses of do-while into equivalent
sets of forward gotos, and regression-tested to verify that I didn't
break anything.  

In doing so, I found two minor bugs; a failure to condition some TSIP
processing on TSIP_ENABLE, and a failure to explicitly reset to
GROUND_STATE in one error case.

Further, I have audited the rest of the code to verify that we have no
other instances of this perversity.

You are correct, this constituted a new low in stupid C tricks.
All gpsd developers are on notice for the future: *don't do that*!
