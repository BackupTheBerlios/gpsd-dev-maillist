Code lock should get you the right second, but there will be some delay.

Assuming the satellite is right overhead, it's something like 2.0e7
metres away - more if the satellite is at a lower elevation. Speed of
light is about 3.0e8 metres per second. It takes at least 66
milliseconds for the code word to get to you. Until you've calculated
a valid 3D position, don't really have any way to tell how much more
delay you are experiencing. If your constellation visibility is such
that you can only track 1 PRN, I wouldn't trust that PRN to be free of
multipath or &quot;evil waveform&quot; effects. I'm going to handwave and say
&quot;this could add up to 1 second of uncertainy.&quot;

The other &quot;second&quot; come from the fact that GPRMC comes after the start
of the second. It tells you which second you are currently
experiencing. How far into the second this happens is vendor
dependent. I'm going to handwave again and say &quot;this could add up to 1
second of uncertainy.&quot;

I guess I should have phrased my original answer as &quot;I wouldn't be
surprised if GPRMC was as much as 2 seconds slow until you have a
valid 3D fix&quot;.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I noticed that gpsd native protocol cannot answer question of time
</I>&gt;<i> when gpsd has no fix. But when I use command 'gpspipe -r' I get time and date
</I>&gt;<i> in GPRMC message. I know, it can be wrong but in the case that receiver was
</I>&gt;<i> synchronised in the near past, it is probable that it is still usable.
</I>
Should we fake it with the server's clock? Nah, that's an extra
syscall. And there are better protocols for time transfer.

Should we copy the time as presented to us? Fairly reasonable, so long
as it doesn't break NTPSHM. Who knows, maybe you do have a receiver in
time-transfer mode. Still, reading the docs for various chipsets, many
of them do not strobe the PPS line unless they have a valid 3D fix.

Based on behaviour observed with SiRF and itrax receivers while
tracking only 1 or 2 PRNs without a navigation solution, I would not
oppose using the receiver's reported time as source for time. If
you're that worried about not getting bad data, you should be checking
fix mode and quality anyway.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
