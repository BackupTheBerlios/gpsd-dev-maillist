&gt;<i> &gt; OK. I've seen gpsd/cgps flashing between extended and truncated week

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  I think this only matters for sirfmon, yes?
</I>
Yes, sirfmon seems to be the only consumer of clock status. I guess
this is pretty irrelevant. Brave/smart programs that want to do
software solutions can parse this out of the raw data somewhere down
the road. Or the raw data codepath can format it for them.

&gt;<i> &gt; binary mode. Perhaps if we cached the version, we could make that be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part of the response to the &quot;I&quot; command?
</I>&gt;<i> That's not a bad idea.
</I>
I'll look into that.

&gt;<i> I could go with &quot;don't disable it if already safely sending&quot;, basically to
</I>&gt;<i> decrease the amount of state we have to restore on exit.
</I>
So if device speed is &gt; 38400 don't disable? 38400 works nicely for
me, though I tend to just use 57600 to be like SiRFdemo.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; OK, but under what circumstances are you recommending we turn on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; tracker mode?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Given the port speed required to support tracker mode: when the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requests it. And consider not disabling it if the the port is already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; running fast enough?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same comment as above.
</I>
Cool. Now we just need a safe way to request tracker mode.

&gt;<i> Not sure how Bluetooth is special here.
</I>
Bluetooth receivers, especially SiRF ones seem especially sensitive to
port and protocol configuration. As I don't have any bluetooth
adapters or receivers, it's a bit difficult for me to investigate
what's breaking. Just that under certain circumstances the port config
fails or the receiver is left incommunicado.

&gt;<i> Right, that's a key question to answer at this point.  Even if it's
</I>&gt;<i> not possible to restore *everything*, it may be possible to do a good
</I>&gt;<i> enough job to avoid a mode switch.
</I>
The important bits. I seem to recall being bitten by a change and not
having dgps/waas  working, even after sending the appropriate control
strings.

&gt;<i> Ah, so you're meditating on a new chattiness command.  I see.
</I>
I'm mulling over a lot of things... I'm not sure what the Right Answer
or Final Solution[1] is yet.

[1] I used &quot;Final Solution&quot; to indicate an idea that someone
passionately believed was right but that eventually turned into a
right ugly mess.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
