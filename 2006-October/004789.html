&gt;<i> &gt; Your implementation of -j in gpspipe was completely broken, BTW.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now that I've fixed it, it's showing de-flickered data coming 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from gpsd.rellim.com.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   That was my fault.  I'm not sure what I was smoking that day.  Good
</I>&gt;<i> thing I don't try to claim extreme compentence as a C programmer...
</I>
Ah,  That explains much.  It didn't seem like a Gary sort of mistake; 
usually the only broken thing about his code is his strange use of
whitespace :-).

Here's the current state of play:

1. We know that the daemon at gpsd.rellim.com is honoring J=1 requests.
   To see this, pull svn HEAD, rebuild gpspipe, and do this:

	gpspipe -w -n 20 -j gpsd.rellim.com

   Notice that altitude is being held across cycles.  For comparison,
   do

	gpspipe -w -n 20 gpsd.rellim.com

   and note the clear-at-start-of-cycle behavior.  In both cases mode
   still flickers.

2. I have implemented a check in the gpsd.c merge logic that should prevent
   mode flicker When J=1 it ensures that mode is never decreased when
   a fix is merged in.

3. I now know why xgps wasn't showing me flicker.  I had implemented, 
   documented, and then forgotten a client-side smoothing hack independent
   of J.  I have disabled this by default, and am now seeing consistent flicker
   behavior from xgps and cgps.

4, *Why* both are flickering remains a mystery.  Given the gpspipe results,
   it looks as though the J=1 setting is getting dropped on the floor 
   somehow, but only from those two clients.  I'm investigating.

Gary, it would be useful if you could pull, build, and run the HEAD 
version of the daemon.  At the very least that would test the new
guard against mode flicker.
