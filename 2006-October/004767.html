You lost me already.  Now there is an additional man page.  A new env
var for the user to manage.  Another questions to ask the user (what is
$WINDOW_ID) when the user reports an error.  Explaining to the user how
to set $WINDOW_ID in his menu system (gnome, kde, windowmaker, etc.)  Explaining
to the user why his one program does 2 different things with a novel
control method that baffles him.

&gt;<i> OK, now suppose the wrapper script has hardened into a main() routine
</I>&gt;<i> in C that does *exactly the same thing*, dispatching to the two
</I>&gt;<i> former main() routines of xgps and cgps.  Now we have a merged client,
</I>&gt;<i> the two display modes live in the same C binary, and the maintenance
</I>&gt;<i> burden has not changed in any way.
</I>
Lost me again.  There is the maintenance burden of doing the merge.  The
burden of checking the X side for every change to the curses side.  The
bruden of checking the curses side for every change in the X side.  You
need to reconfig and recompile to check the with and without X modes.
These all consume effort.  None of this effort is needed now.

&gt;<i> Thus your argument goes poof.  The only way it would have force is if the X
</I>&gt;<i> and curses code got deeply commingled.  That's not going to happen,
</I>&gt;<i> the APIs are too different.
</I>
Well clearly we are not feeling the same elephant.

&gt;<i> Me, I don't actually care whether the merger gets done via a wrapper
</I>&gt;<i> script or by linking -- what matters to me is that the *user should
</I>&gt;<i> never have to know the difference between xgps and cgps*.
</I>
But he DOES need to know, because sometimes he wants to run an X program
and sometimes he wants to run a command line program and he will be baffled
by when it runs one way and sometimes another seemingly by magic.

nvi does this and it really confuses users.  They just do not understand
that they could really be the same program.  More advanced users compile
two nvi's.  One with and one without X because the X version is so
bloated.

&gt;<i> You guys are thinking like developers again.
</I>
I don't agree with that either.  As a developer I sort of see them
together.  Except that I hate to have projects that require wide
skill sets (gps and curses and lesstif) to maintain.  It is as a
trainer/sysadmin remembering all the user problems that mtr and nvi
create for users (and therefore me) that really puts me off on this.
