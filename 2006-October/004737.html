</I>
Not that I know it can't, just that it was easier to recode it than
grok the current code.

The delays needed in baud changing ar also problematic.  I really hate
to do things like add large wait delays in a dameon that has to serve
multiple clients.  The second was that it was easier to code my own loop
that to figure out how to jam the current autobaud/packet detector into
certain modes.

I guess we'll see if we can solve these problems.  Please do not delete
garminctl until we do!

&gt;<i> Or, to put the question more precisely: What prevents us from adding
</I>&gt;<i> this as a capability to whatever driver in libgpsd(3) is handling
</I>&gt;<i> Garmin serial binary?
</I>
Same thing as all projects, time.

&gt;<i> &gt; The second is that having a differently coded decoder has been usefull
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for debugging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, but be prepared to throw the prototype away.  I fear deeply the
</I>&gt;<i> consequences of having our maintenance capability spread among
</I>&gt;<i> redundant driver implementations.  I see that I have led us into error
</I>&gt;<i> by the example of sirfmon; I'll have to fix that.
</I>
Balance that with the complexity of putting all the eggs in the one big
basket.  Sirfmon came about because it was easy to code up a standalone
test and figure out how the GPS device works before having to figure out
how to integrate into the big daemon.

These standalone tools will always be useful bootstraps.  The real
question is how long they need to persist.

And having one big packet engine has maintenance problems of it's own.
Standalone tools don't affect as many different GPS so do not need to
undergo as extensive testing as things in gpd.  For example, I got back
to the garmin serial now that I have the big push out on the garmin USB.
It looks like some recent changes have broken Garmin serial.  Not sure
what did it yet.  Makes me wonder what I might have broken.

Having garminctl let me put my GPS-18/lvc in a useable mode for now.  If
garminctl depended on gpsd/libgpd I would be SOL.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Adding an option to preset the driver type rather than going through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the hunt loop, so the tool doesn't depend on packet.c, is left as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; utterly trivial exercise -- hint: look at the function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; gpsd_switch_driver() in libgpsd_core.c.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This will be key as a core function of the *ctl is switching from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NMEA to proprietary modes and back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that. But normally you shouldn't ever have to specify a
</I>&gt;<i> driver type to switch modes, because gpsctrl will figure out what kind it's
</I>&gt;<i> looking at exactly the same way that gpsd does.
</I>
As Chris pointed out, gpsd can have a hard time recovering from all
psossible configurations.  Using a tool that starts with the knowledge of
the target GPS has a better chance getting the GPS into a better state.
