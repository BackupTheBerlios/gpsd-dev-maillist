<PRE>&quot;The end of a packet is &lt;ETX&gt; preceeded by an odd number of &lt;DLE&gt; bytes.&quot;
That's just so horrible. On the whole, searching for that pattern
doesn't seem like such a bad idea. It'd be nice to know how it breaks
in practice.

Maybe its wishful thinking, but is there a fixed, known message you
could detect?

Apparently TSIP sends 0x46 and 0x4B together, every 5 seconds - look
for that pattern?

Maybe you want to live dangerously, risk the wrath of the embedded
folks, and use regex? It wouldn't be that bad - just a couple, at
protocol detection time.

Are there default packets that garmin sends that TSIP doesn't, or vice versa?

-------------------------------

On a slightly related note, perhaps we should set up a library of gps
data - 15 minutes of every message supported by that protocol. 15
minutes should give you a full navigation message, and probably an
almanac/ephemeris dump too. A static receiver is fine we're just
interested in the raw packets so we can test various decoders and
protocol sniffers. I happen to have such a recording from a
SiRFstarIII, i'll have one from a Lassen iQ by the end of the month,
and maybe an iTalk as well. Gary will likely be able to contribute one
for Garmin. 15 minutes of compressed data from the very chatty
SiRFstarIII is only 1.3MB.

Recordings could be expressed it a format similar to &quot;tcpdump -ttx&quot;:
timestamp to the microsecond, space, some arbitrary amount of
description, space, hexdump of the payload. That makes it easy to
construct a replay engine with your choice of C, perl, python or
possibly even COBOL or FORTRAN.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
