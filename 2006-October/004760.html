<PRE>(Copied to gpsd-dev as I think this point is of general interest.)

Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; +*** Merge cgps and xgps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +cgps and xgps should merge into a single test client that honors the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +GPSD_UNITS environment variable and chooses its UI mode depending on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +whether or not it's running under X.  A good small project for someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +who doesn't want to get into the full complexity of the daemon code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would then require small systems to either have the X libs installed
</I>&gt;<i> or be compiled without X.  Certainly there is code that can be shared
</I>&gt;<i> but there is real value in not cluttering commandline tools with all
</I>&gt;<i> the Xlibs.
</I>
If this were 1994 and Linux had only static linking, I'd agree with you.
But I don't think this is a real issue any more, not on modern systems
with dynamic linking.  We have two major use cases:

1. Tiny systems that can't support X at all.

2. PCs where X applications are running essentially all the time.

For case 1, we honor --without-x as Chris pointed out we should,  Nobody
pays any X library overhead at all under any circumstances.

For case 2, the X libs are going to be in core all the time anyway, so
the only overhead a combination client would have over &quot;plain&quot; cgps is
memory space for the hatful of code presently in xgps.c and a couple
of dynamic-link pointers.

About the only time we could potentially have an issue is if somebody
happened to be running the merged client on a virtual console with
X shut down,  Even then, modern VM systems probably wouldn't pull the
X libs into the working set unless one of the entry pointers got chased.
