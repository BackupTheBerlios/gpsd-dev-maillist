I think I should distinguish between &quot;GPSD&quot; the package of useful gps
hardware utilities and &quot;gpsd&quot; the daemon that usually listens on
tcp/2947 and does I/O to some ttys.

In this case, the software solver would be somewhere in the
distribution (softgpsd? gpssoftd?) but doesn't need to run inside the
regular gpsd that just forwards data over the net.

&gt;<i> I would like to see the fancy calcs so we can get super resolution from
</I>&gt;<i> our GPS, but I agree it does not belong in gpsd.  I would chop the
</I>&gt;<i> baby in half: have gpsd optionally pass on the sat phase and such to a
</I>&gt;<i> client.  The client could then calc as it sees fit.
</I>
With super-raw, we have the beginnings of this. As I said on
gpsd-users (<A HREF="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gpsd-users&amp;m=116110349618342">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gpsd-users&amp;m=116110349618342</A>)
there are a number of fairly accessible receivers that don't make us
jump through too many disgusting hoops to get the raw data needed for
software solutions.

Thinking about this, and I've sort of settled on the idea that either
an extended command set message or an R=3 message could trigger gpsd
to attempt a decode of the vendor raw measurements into a standard
internal structure which would then be output for later consumption.

&gt;<i> I see 2 possible clients.  One takes some RTCM (or other) corrections
</I>&gt;<i> and applies it in real time.  Another saves the raw data so it can
</I>&gt;<i> be postprocessed at a later time.  There are several ways to get
</I>&gt;<i> precise correction data, but only after enough delays to rule out
</I>&gt;<i> real time processing.
</I>
I was thinking of the multi-client strategy as well. RINEX writer,
toy-survey mode... i think most of the raw-&gt;struct parsing, and Hard
Math(tm) can be factored into a library for use/reuse by client apps.
Sort of like how gpsd_hexdump and gpsd_report get reused all over the
place.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
