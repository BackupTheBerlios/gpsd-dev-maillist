Hmm, that is a new one to me.  A quick check shows it is not a reliable

not an indicator if I WANT to run an app as a X app.

Is it?  I thought the point of X was client/server?  Smells like the same
fish to me.

I see the sat listing is now fixed, that was slightly broken, at least
for me, for a long time.  Maybe broken is too strong a word but cgps has
more features than xgps.  I would hate to drag down cgops work by requiring
the same functions be ported to X at the same time.

Also, if we are going to mainline xgps then I would rather throw out
lesstiff and have someone recode it in gtk2.  Before doing either it
would be nice to hear from anyone interested in Qtopia land to see their
thoughts on this.
