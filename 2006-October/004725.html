<PRE>OK, Chris and Gary, take a look at gpsctrl.c in SVN head.

I was careful about the layer separation between libpsd(3) qnd the
policy logic in gpsd.c for a reason, and the fact that I can write an
entire device-control tool in less than one day (during which I've
also taken plenty of time to sleep late, make love with my wife, play
with our cats, eat a superb mushroom-and-andouille omelette, read the
news, and practice swordfighting with the aforesaid wife) is exactly
that reason.

Note how it tries to change parameters through the daemon first.  The
advantage of this is that you don't need root and don't need to
specify a device (in the usual case of just one GPS and no other users).

If it can't connect to the daemon, it uses the same library primitives
gpsd itself does to open a device directly, and to sniff packets until
it gets a lock on baud-rate and GPS type.  It then does its control
functions through the driver of the device type it determined via the
packet sniff.

This tool will instantly and automatically support any GPS for which
we have the required driver capabilities.  All GPS-type detection
lives in *one* place -- packet.c.  All GPS-type-dependent magic lives
in *one* place -- the driver for the type.  There is only one copy
of the autobauding logic. Maintenance hassles are kept to a minimum.

Adding an option to preset the driver type rather than going through
the hunt loop, so the tool doesn't depend on packet.c, is left as an
utterly trivial exercise -- hint: look at the function
gpsd_switch_driver() in libgpsd_core.c.

It should be pellucidly clear how to add new control functions 
like setting the static-nav bit.  

1. Add a new method to the libgpsd(3) driver structure.
2. (Optional) Add a new request/response type to the gpsd protocol.
3. Add a new option to gpsctrl, with code in the 'lowlevel' branch
   that either complains and exits if the driver method is NULL
   or invokes it with appropriate arguments.
4. If you did step 2, add a gps_query() call to the non-lowlevel branch.

The *only* downside of this approach is that over time the driver structure
might grow a method or two that gpsctl uses but gpsd doesn't.  And
if that ever becomes a footprint issue, I already know how to fix the
architecture to make it go away (sketch: two parallel arrays of method
structures, with only one of them linked in gpsd).

Now, Chris, please do us all a favor.  You're the guy with the major use
case, so test this puppy and pound out any minor bugs I've left in.
Then take sirfctl, garminctl, and itraxctl out behind the barn and
*shoot them through the head*.
