First off, I'd like to know where you're getting this centisecond
resolution from. I don't recall seeing that anywhere in my reading. If
I've missed something I'd like to hear about it.

Let me just say: RTFM. Most timing receivers specify their PPS
characteristics quite carefully.

Navsync for example says &quot;The time pulse interface outputs a precise
pulse with respect to TUC time. Typically this is a 1pps signal. The
time pulse is output on the 1PPS port (pin 38). The signal is active
high with the rising edge synchronous (+/- 30ns) to the UTC second and
has a width of 100us. For the 1pps to be valid the receiver must have
a valid position fix and have received the UTC-GPS separation
parameter downloaded from the satellite, this may take up to 12.5
minutes from a cold start.&quot; Furthermore the rise time has a maximum of
10ns.

Novatel specifies their superstar more or less the same way, but they
say the rising edge is synchronous +/- 200ns.

Magellan/Thales/Ashtech A12/B12/AC12 specify 250ns alignment.

uBlox specifies 43ns on the Antaris4 LEA-4T because they align to a
23.104MHz sampling clock. 7ns typical rise time, 23ns rise time worst
case.

Many receivers also let you program the rising or falling pulses and
pulse widths.

&gt;<i> At best, &quot;PPS is +/- 1uS to GPS time&quot; reads as a promise that their
</I>&gt;<i> hardware/firmware is an order of magnitude too fast to get latency lag that
</I>&gt;<i> would make it report the wrong centisecond.
</I>
Typically the floating point message timestamp is when the fix was
calculated. Vendors seem to try make that happen at a consistently
part of the second. As for the PPS pulse versus time message, the
pulse comes first, then the message that tells you what second it was.
So you need 3 seconds to get PPS sync.

Many receivers have something like a 100MHz ARM7 processor with some
sort of programmable timer. Given that it takes maybe .2 seconds to
calculate a navigation solution, how about using that other .8 seconds
to count code bits and use that to steer your programmable timer.

&gt;<i> Chris, who groks the ISGPS downlink protocol much better than I do, might
</I>&gt;<i> have something to say about this.
</I>
There. I've said it.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
