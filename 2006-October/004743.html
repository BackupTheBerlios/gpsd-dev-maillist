<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The delays needed in baud changing ar also problematic.  I really hate
</I>&gt;<i> to do things like add large wait delays in a dameon that has to serve
</I>&gt;<i> multiple clients.
</I>
Don't worry about it.  The B command is disabled when there's more than one
user in order to prevent DOS attacks.  So large wait delays aren't really
a big deal here -- you can only be hit by one if you asked for it :-).

&gt;<i> I guess we'll see if we can solve these problems.  Please do not delete
</I>&gt;<i> garminctl until we do!
</I>
I hadn't planned to, but I'm not going to ship garminctl/sirfctl/itraxctl
in the RPM, either, nor expose their docs on the website.  If you're defending
these on the theory that they're scaffolding, they won't be treated as part
of the public toolset.
 
&gt;<i> These standalone tools will always be useful bootstraps.  The real
</I>&gt;<i> question is how long they need to persist.
</I>
And, as the project's software-architecture Nazi, I'm going to be the
guy constantly pushing for them to get scrapped.

&gt;<i> And having one big packet engine has maintenance problems of it's own.
</I>&gt;<i> Standalone tools don't affect as many different GPS so do not need to
</I>&gt;<i> undergo as extensive testing as things in gpd.
</I>
I'm aware of this problem. That's why the packet getter has its own
regression test.  You can help by adding more sample-packet initializers
(both well-formed and broken in creative ways) to packet_test.c

&gt;<i> As Chris pointed out, gpsd can have a hard time recovering from all
</I>&gt;<i> psossible configurations.  Using a tool that starts with the knowledge of
</I>&gt;<i> the target GPS has a better chance getting the GPS into a better state.
</I>
You both say this, but I don't see what makes it true.
