&gt;<i> Gentlemen,

</I>&gt;<i> do you have idea how accurate is time reported by GPS receiver when it has no

</I>
Probably +/- 2 seconds including communication latency, assuming they
have code lock. But let's say the reported time of week is 000042. Is
that 42 seconds since the receiver was turned on, or 42 seconds after
the start of the week? You don't know for sure until you have a valid
fix. Or what about right after a valid fix is calculated but before
the UTC correction parameter has been received? Then you're 14 seconds
off.

&gt;<i> Like in situation when only one or two satelites are visible; I think
</I>&gt;<i> this is called 1D mode. I don't talk about situation when no satelitte is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How big can be difference in time between NOFIX and 2DFIX mode?
</I>
Some receivers can cope with 1D mode. But they usually have to be
specially set up to do so. Static navigation set, fixed position
loaded, and the navigation algorithm set to always use that position
and just use the code to steer the local clock. Whether or not there
is an explicit configuration command, I think SiRF, uBlox and iTrax
all try to steer the local clock towards gps time even if only one PRN
is being tracked.

Personally, if my gps is willing to admit that it's not confident in
its output, then I'm willing to believe it.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
