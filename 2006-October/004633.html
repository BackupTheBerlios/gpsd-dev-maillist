</I>
Not when it's supposed to be invoked by a udev script that doesn't
know what options to pass it.  The conceptual problem here, Chris, is
that you think like a developer rather than a user, from the inside
outwards.  To you, specially invoking gpsd is no big deal -- but 
a no-reconfigure flag *wouldn't solve the problem for users*.

And RTFM is not a good answer.  When *users* (not techies like us) are
involved, the need for documentation is a demonstration of design
failure.

I've been using gpsd to train myself out of this bad habit,
actually. It took a lot of mental effort for me to get to the point
where I adopted no-compromise zero configuration as a main goal.
Having achieved enlightenment, I forgo departing the mundane plane in
order to shower bodhisattva-like whacks with the clue stick on my
fellow programmers.  See my recent remarks about the proposed -t option 
for cgps as an example.

Here's *your* whack.  Why do you want a no-reconfigure flag?  Because
it messes with your GPS settings.  Fine, if that's the actual problem,
think from the outside-in for a moment; wouldn't it be smarter to try
to save settings on startup and restore any changed settings on exit
from gpsd?

It may turn out this isn't possible.  But it's *the question you
should have asked first*.  Whenever you feel an urge to add an option
or a mode flag, you should teach yourself to ask whether there's a way
to get the actual Right Thing to happen without it.

&gt;<i> &gt;I think this needs to be command-enabled.  Some of our embedded users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;are actually going to care about the extra cycles processing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;tracker data eats.  And I think I remember that I disabled after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;leap-second acquisition because it led rto trouble at low baud rates.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ya figure? Look at byte 5 of the sirf message, if it's not a position
</I>&gt;<i> or time report, just skip it. No parsing required beyond that which
</I>&gt;<i> we'd have to do anyway. Embedded users: you can chime in any time
</I>&gt;<i> now...
</I>
You may have misunderstood me.  The problem isn't excessive processor
overhead, it's that at low baud rates there aren't enough frames per
second available for an entire cycle's worth of data with the subframe
stuff in.

&gt;<i> Leap second acquisition would be troublesome at low baud rates, which
</I>&gt;<i> is why the manuals tend to indicate the use of 57600 for working with
</I>&gt;<i> the tracker data.
</I>
And the above is why.  I wanted the code to be as resilient as possible 
at any baud rate.
 
I'll launch a detailed discussion of command-set extension in another post.
