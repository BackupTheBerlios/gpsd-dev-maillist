&gt;<i> We're already going to refactor *ctl into a single gpsctl front end.
</I>
I know that.  But there are three possible ways to write such a tool,
and so far the only one of the three that is dead wrong is the one I
see in the garminctl/itraxctl/sirfctl code.

1. Write a special-purpose client

Advantages: it's GPS-type-independent, because it automatically inerits
GPSD's autobauding and driver logic.  If you only have one GPS on your
system, you don't even have to specify a device.

Disadvantages: Won't work if gpsd isn't running.  If gpsd is broken,
it will be too.

2. Write a wrapper around the low-level libgpsd(3) interface library

Advantages: Will work even when gpsd isn't running.  Can use libgpsd(3)'s
autobauding and type detection, but doesn't have to (you could pass 
it a speed and type explicitly)).

3. Write a bunch of hand-crufted code that duplicates portions of gpsd's
   drivers and autobauding.

Advantages: None whatsoever over 2.
Disadvantages:  Duplicates code out the wazoo.  Guaranteed maintainance
problems as the tweak code in the control tool and the libgpsd(3) drivers 
diverges.

You and Gary drifted into alternative 3.  No good.  Crash landing.
I can only guess that you forgot the libgpsd(3) layer existed and that
gpsd itself is a thin select(2)-driven wrapper around it.

Or, to put it in pictures, Here's the current organization:

           gpsd                garminctl                sirfctl
       +------------+    +-------------------+    +-------------------+
       |   gpsd.c   |    | option processing |    | option processing |
       +------------+    +-------------------+    +-------------------+
       |            |    | partial duplicate |    | partial duplicate |
       | libgpsd(3) |    |   of portions     |    |   of portions     |
       |            |    |   of libgpsd(3)   |    |   of libgpsd(3)   |
       +------------+    +-------------------+    +-------------------+

Here's how it *should* look:

           gpsd                gpsctrl        
       +------------+    +-------------------+
       |   gpsd.c   |    | option processing |
       +------------+    +-------------------+
       |            |    |                   |
       | libgpsd(3) |    |    libgpsd(3)     |
       |            |    |                   |
       +------------+    +-------------------+

&gt;<i> One of the reasons to have such tools is for when gpsd's code fails on
</I>&gt;<i> badly behaved hardware. SS3 (or at least products similar to the
</I>&gt;<i> Globalsat BU-353) have this nasty ability to not get the baud switch
</I>&gt;<i> right. SiRFdemo even has trouble setting the protocol and speed.
</I>
So, when we figure out what the right thing is, we put it in *one*
place (the libgpsd(3) drivers) and have both gpsd and the GPS control
tool use it.  Until we figure out what the right thing is, we keep our
best guess in *one* place (the libgpsd(3) drivers) and have both gpsd
and the GPS control tool use it.

Yes, sirfmon partially duplicates the sirf.c driver.  That was a
belt-and-suspenders hack from back when the SiRF binary driver in
libgpsd(3) was new and untested, because I'm careful and paranoid.
It's not a good example to emulate two years later.  Someday I'm going
to gut sirfmon; I think you've just persuaded me that &quot;someday&quot;
needs to be &quot;soon&quot; so nobody else gets a wrong idea.

&gt;<i> Also, it's nice when people bring me their receivers to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> force the protocol and be done with it. A number of bluetooth users
</I>&gt;<i> have been bitten by gpsd trying to switch port speed and protocol -
</I>&gt;<i> again, probably Globalsat's fault.
</I>
Fair enough -- but almost irrelevant to how the protocol-forcer is
actually implemented.  (Might be a weak argument against the 
special-purpose client approach).

&gt;<i> Finally, there are things that gpsd probably has no need to worry
</I>&gt;<i> about. Static navigation - yeah, that's actually kinda relevant to
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.
</I>
Yes, it is.  At this point setting the static-nav bit is the strongest
use case for implementing a GPSD-NG protocol.

&gt;<i>           Onboard datalogger settings? Not so relevant. Retrieving logs
</I>&gt;<i> from a suitably programmed SiRF or iTrax is probably the province of a
</I>&gt;<i> standalone tool.
</I>
True, but irrelevant to my objection.  I'm not kvetching about the
existence of the control tools, I'm kvetching about the the fact that
you hand-crufted code that duplicates the libgpsd(3) driver
capabilities, *Don't do that!*

I'm not just going to bitch about this, I'm going to show you how it
should be done with actual code.  I've got a gpsctrl.c prototype on
my drive now that I wrote over brunch.  It uses the special-purpose-client 
approach, but the obvious next step is to enable it to call libgpsd(3)
directly when gpsd is not running.

Expect some major checkins in a few minutes.
