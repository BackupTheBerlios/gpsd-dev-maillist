I am perfectly serious and I am not just yanking your chain.  It is the
way I work day to day.  I very rarely run my X server (the display) on
the same host as my X client (the program itself).

I keep the programs I run on a few heavy duty servers.  Those have lots
of CPU, RAM and RAID disk.  They get backed up regularly.  They have 3
hours of batteries and sit in racks.  Then I access them from whatever
cheap terminal is near me.

That way I have the mobility of laptops and the security and power of
the machine in the glass house.  If that sounds familiar, yes, I came
from an IBM/360 background.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, if we are going to mainline xgps then I would rather throw out

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be nice to hear from anyone interested in Qtopia land to see

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've also had the thought that it would be nice to redo it in a more
</I>&gt;<i> modern toolkit.
</I>
Good we agree on that.

&gt;<i>  Unfortunately, to do this we'd probably have to pick
</I>&gt;<i> a side in the GTK/Qt war, something I'd prefer not to mess with.
</I>
Chicken. :-)  Nicholas Petreley has made his side clear, you can too.

Some people pick a third way, like fltk.  As for myself, I'll likely
stick to curses no matter what.
