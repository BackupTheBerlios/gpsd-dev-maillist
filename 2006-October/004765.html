<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; I've actually been thinking recently that it would be nice to merge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; xgps and cgps into a single test client that chooses its display method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; depending on whether or not it's running under X.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are people that understand gpsd, people that understand curses and
</I>&gt;<i> people that understand X widgets.  A much smaller group know 2 of them and
</I>&gt;<i> a really small group knows all three. You really cut the number of
</I>&gt;<i> potential maintainers drastically when you merge them.
</I>
Suppose we still had two clients, cgps and xgps, but fixed so they
have identical invocation options and handling of GPSD_UNITS.  Now
suppose the user-visible client is a trivial script that dispatches to one or
the other depending on whether WINDOW_ID is defined, and passes in any
command-line options the user gave.  Literally, the gps script could be
this:

if [ $WINDOW_ID ]
then
	xgps $*
else
	cgps $*
fi

I think you'd agree that this would be no more of a maintenance problem
than the current partitioning.  Right?

OK, now suppose the wrapper script has hardened into a main() routine
in C that does *exactly the same thing*, dispatching to the two
former main() routines of xgps and cgps.  Now we have a merged client,
the two display modes live in the same C binary, and the maintenance
burden has not changed in any way.

Thus your argument goes poof.  The only way it would have force is if the X
and curses code got deeply commingled.  That's not going to happen,
the APIs are too different.

Me, I don't actually care whether the merger gets done via a wrapper
script or by linking -- what matters to me is that the *user should
never have to know the difference between xgps and cgps*.

You guys are thinking like developers again.
