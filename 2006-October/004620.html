If you're going to approximate, please use 1575MHz, 1227MHz and 1176MHz.

Carrier phase tracking. Such tricks can be done with most of the
consumer-ish receivers I've repeatedly mentioned. The ones I've
mentioned output pseudoranges and carrier phases and given enough time
and measurements can be used to do more precise positioning.

One thing survey receivers tend to have going for them is calibration.
RF cables with known delay, carefully measured antenna stands, known
phase center of the antenna, choke rings... Makes for a better initial
observation, even in the single-frequency case.

The dual frequency receivers watch for a something vaguely like the
P(Y) code on one frequency and then expect to see the same code a
short time later on the other (and soon to be a 3rd frequency). Given
that the same signal was transmitted on L1 and L2 at the same time,
you can calculate how badly the ionosphere was mucking with your
signal and can correct for it much more accurately than using the
single frequency model. The code is encrypted, so you can't use it as
a ranging signal, but being able to measure the delay of the same data
through the same space but on a different carrier tells you a lot
about what's in that space.

Note that the 3rd frequency doesn't win you much more over dual
frequency... about 6% more interference can be removed. But for those
of us poor schmucks living with single frequency all these years,
going to L1+L5C will be a blessing.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
