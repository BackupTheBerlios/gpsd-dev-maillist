I gave you a stripped-down C-style example of why the O report isn't
being handled correctly by cgps. Or, it's being handled too
correctly...

There is a buffer (of type char *), containing some text which we hope
to turn into a numeric type (namely a float) using the sscanf
function. If we ask sscanf to turn something like &quot;42.0&quot; into a
number, it can and will do that. If we ask sscanf to turn somethink
like &quot;?&quot; into a number it can't. The question mark doesn't convert to
a number, so sscanf stops. As the field right after PTNTHM is &quot;?&quot;
sscanf stops there and doesn't try convert the rest of the message.

Briefly, that's the problem.

&gt;<i> What do you mean by &quot;trust the users&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> If I get the 3 values out of TNTC using gpsd I'm happy.
</I>
What about using other messages, like &quot;IAVT&quot;.

As for trusting the users, it's not fair to expect that every user
know the ins and outs of every device and every protocol. GPSD does
some filtering and if there's good data, you'll get it, if not you get
a &quot;?&quot;. We try hard to do the Right Thing, and filling in &quot;0.0&quot; for a
measurement for which we really have no idea does not seem like the
Right Thing.

Maybe we could zero the fields, and hope that truenorth users read the
docs to see what's meaningful?

Alternatively, gps_unpack needs to stop using sscanf, and switch to
using atof for the conversion.

&gt;<i> Just let me know if there's a new revision.
</I>
Just committed something to make &quot;AVT&quot; give you some moderately useful
information.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
