And I mostly agree with that.  it is the interpretation where we differ.

&gt;<i> gpspipe has two major use cases:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) As a generator for shell pipelines or logger processes picking up

</I>
You missed two:

3) logger for local gpsd.

4) as a splitter to grab NMEA and feed it back in to a system that
   wants NMEA that looks like it is coming from a tty because it does
   not grok gpsd speak.

&gt;<i> What I'm saying is that we're already so dependent on Python for test
</I>&gt;<i> tools that one more can't make our exposure any worse.
</I>
No disagreement here, except gpspipe is not just a test tool.

&gt;<i> On to case 2.  Maybe you can persuade me that I'm wrong, but I just
</I>&gt;<i> can't easily visualize this kind of activity being *hosted* on a
</I>&gt;<i> system too small for Python.
</I>
#3 and #4 have have been used on gumstix type systems.

&gt;<i> Sure, I can see collecting data from an
</I>&gt;<i> SBC in a balloon somewhere using gpspipe, but it's 2006 -- if the
</I>&gt;<i> collecting system has enough marbles to do shell pipelines, requiring
</I>&gt;<i> Python just isn't a big deal anymore.
</I>
bash is big these days, but not THAT big.  Pretty much any embedded
system has bash these days, not so for python.

&gt;<i> But the real reason I want to move that code is that it's ugly.  It
</I>&gt;<i> was a grubby, fast-and-dirty hack when Gary originally wrote it and
</I>&gt;<i> it hasn't gotten any prettier since.
</I>
Ain't broke don't fix it.  See the recent discussion in Linux Journal
about the BlackJack shell scripts.  OTOH, if you have any stylistic
suggestions to the code I would be happy top consider them.

Or looked at another way:  Only a programmer looks inside to find
elegance.  A user just cares that the program does the right thing.
Think like how a user views it!

&gt;<i> Time to rewrite -- and since
</I>&gt;<i> I think I can collapse that 331 lines into maybe 40 lines of Python
</I>&gt;<i> that seems like the way to go.
</I>
Have at it, won't hurt my feelings.  Just be sure that the &quot;make install&quot;
of the python works first.  I always have to manualy install the gpsd
python parts.  The big problem is the failure to autodetect the proper
place to install the python  modules.

It also seems like you are making a good case for a &quot;contrib&quot; directory
in gpsd.  Python may be the best thing since sliced bread, but for one
reason or another is not useable by everyone.  Little bits and pieces
of sample code are good for folks to learn how to use the gpsd daemon.
