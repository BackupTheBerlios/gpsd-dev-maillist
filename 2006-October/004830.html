<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I thought you were against bulk whitespace changes because it broek the
</I>&gt;<i> SVN change trail?  I guess not....
</I>
Normally I am, but I'll admit I reformatted large parts of gpspipe.c
just so I'd be able to read it without my eyes hurting. (Note that
instead of doing that when I have to modify garmin.c I grit my teeth
and use your formatting style, insofar as I understand it.  So I do
have some respect...)

&gt;<i> If you are going to do things like this then let's agree on an indent
</I>&gt;<i> profile and run it over all the code.
</I>
No joke, I've been giving that serious consideration recently, and not just
because of *your* weird style either.  It wasn't an issue back when this was
almost a one-man project, but the gallimaufry of strange indenting styles
we have in the code now is beginning to make me uncomfortable.

BTW, the &quot;house style&quot; we've evolved, insofar as there is one, isn't
even *my* normal style, it's like a hybrid between my normal style
(which is pretty straight-up Berkeley/C++ indenting) and K&amp;R. I left a
lot of K&amp;R-isms in place in order to make the diff history easier to
read.  So don't jump to the conclusion that I'm grinding an axe for my
personal indent preferences -- the code would look rather different if
that were true.  What I want is a style that's readable and uniform
and disrupts reading of change histories as little as is consistent
with those objectives.

I've even done a little experimenting with indent(1) to try to find a
set of options that regularizes the &quot;house style&quot; so that we can put
all the code in a uniform style with the fewest possible changes.  But
I find that by default indent(1) wants to re-arrange way too much, and
haven't yet found the options to stop it from mucking around with the
things I don't want it to change.

When and if I find that magic set of options, I probably will reformat
everything and then publish the indent option set in the Hacking
Guide.  My criterion for the magic set is that it has to not mess with
more than about one line in ten or so, so looking at diff histories
still works.  But this is about the lowest-priority personal to-do
item I have on this project, so it's unlikely to happen any time soon.
