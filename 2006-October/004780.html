</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You lost me already.  Now there is an additional man page.  A new env

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eh?  Why a new man page?  By hypothesis, these versions of xgps and

</I>&gt;<i> cgps(1) man pages both go away.  That's sort of the point, to simplify
</I>&gt;<i> the interface the user sees.
</I>
Maybe it is one combend page, but it has to reference 3 commands now
instead of 2.  cgps, xgp and new-gps.

&gt;<i> &gt; Another questions to ask the user (what is $WINDOW_ID) when the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user reports an error.  Explaining to the user how to set $WINDOW_ID
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in his menu system (gnome, kde, windowmaker, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> X itself sets this variable.
</I>
Not on my hosts:

- ----
kong ~ # echo $WINDOW_ID

etc....

&gt;<i> Users never have to touch it, nor is it
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on the window manager.  (Yes, I've written interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> with this pattern before.)
</I>
So all the hours I have spent on the phone getting $DISPLAY to work
were not needed?  Explaining how to get .xauth and xhost to grok the
ssh tunnel?  I wish it were so easy.

&gt;<i> &gt;                                                        Explaining
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the user why his one program does 2 different things with a novel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control method that baffles him.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's much closer to your target.  I do consider it a serious argument.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question here is how the cognitive overhead of understanding why
</I>&gt;<i> gps(1) comes up in different modes depending on where you invoke it
</I>&gt;<i> compares to the overhead of remenbering that there are two different tools
</I>&gt;<i> with (at least at present) two different option sets.
</I>
I can go with merging the option sets.  Just remember the reason they
diverged was because it is so much easier to program curses then
lesstiff and more programmers know how to do it.

&gt;<i> I think the former is easier on the user.  You think the the latter is.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the right thing to do is ask some real users.
</I>
I have found users (as opposed to truly computer literate folks) rarely
know what they want.  Better to run some tests and see which ones work.

&gt;<i> &gt; Lost me again.  There is the maintenance burden of doing the merge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One-shot.  About two hours' work.  When I think about long-term
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance overhead (which I do a lot) I discount one-shots heavily.
</I>
I agree, except the two hours is prolly 4 or 6.  Now we are back to
salami-slicing.  It is not any one task, it is the sum total of effort
expended when there are more worthy projects in need of effort.

&gt;<i> &gt; The burden of checking the X side for every change to the curses side.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bruden of checking the curses side for every change in the X side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Um...we already have this, or hadn't you noticed?   Most recent example
</I>&gt;<i> was the J switch -- that *still* isn't merged on the X side.  We automatically
</I>&gt;<i> have this burden if we want to keep separate clients in rough functional
</I>&gt;<i> sync; it doesn't really matter if they're linked or co-wrapped or whatever.
</I>
But you do not need to reconfigure and recompile to test.  You just need
to run cgps and xgps.  And the fact that xgps stays slightly broken all
the time should show you what a pain it is to work on.

&gt;<i> &gt; need to reconfig and recompile to check the with and without X modes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These all consume effort.  None of this effort is needed now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, we already have this problem with separate clients.  I notice it
</I>&gt;<i> because I'm the release engineer.  I guess it's not your fault that
</I>&gt;<i> you don't.
</I>
Then you are doing to much work. cgps has no X dependency now, and xgps
only works with X, so there is no need to configure/make/test with
and without X except to very that autoconfuse skips building xgps for
- --without-x.

&gt;<i> &gt; But he DOES need to know, because sometimes he wants to run an X program
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and sometimes he wants to run a command line program and he will be baffled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by when it runs one way and sometimes another seemingly by magic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's your warrant for believing this?  That is, under what circumstances
</I>&gt;<i> would a user on an X display want to force the curses version?
</I>
I do all the time.  Others on this list do.  I believe it because
experience shows us that is what does happen.
