<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> You lost me already.  Now there is an additional man page.  A new env
</I>&gt;<i> var for the user to manage.
</I>
Eh?  Why a new man page?  By hypothesis, these versions of xgps and
cgps have the same options; all the cgps(1) man page has to do is note
somewhere that under the hood it's dispatching to two binaries.  In
fact the number of man pages *reduces* by one -- the xgps(1) and
cgps(1) man pages both go away.  That's sort of the point, to simplify
the interface the user sees.

&gt;<i> Another questions to ask the user (what is $WINDOW_ID) when the
</I>&gt;<i> user reports an error.  Explaining to the user how to set $WINDOW_ID
</I>&gt;<i> in his menu system (gnome, kde, windowmaker, etc.)
</I>
X itself sets this variable.  Users never have to touch it, nor is it
dependent on the window manager.  (Yes, I've written interfaces
with this pattern before.)

&gt;<i>                                                        Explaining
</I>&gt;<i> to the user why his one program does 2 different things with a novel
</I>&gt;<i> control method that baffles him.
</I>
That's much closer to your target.  I do consider it a serious argument.

The question here is how the cognitive overhead of understanding why
gps(1) comes up in different modes depending on where you invoke it 
compares to the overhead of remenbering that there are two different tools
with (at least at present) two different option sets.

I think the former is easier on the user.  You think the the latter is.
Probably the right thing to do is ask some real users.

&gt;<i> Lost me again.  There is the maintenance burden of doing the merge.
</I>
One-shot.  About two hours' work.  When I think about long-term 
maintenance overhead (which I do a lot) I discount one-shots heavily.

&gt;<i> The burden of checking the X side for every change to the curses side.  The
</I>&gt;<i> bruden of checking the curses side for every change in the X side.
</I>
Um...we already have this, or hadn't you noticed?   Most recent example
was the J switch -- that *still* isn't merged on the X side.  We automatically
have this burden if we want to keep separate clients in rough functional
sync; it doesn't really matter if they're linked or co-wrapped or whatever.

&gt;<i>                                                              You
</I>&gt;<i> need to reconfig and recompile to check the with and without X modes.
</I>&gt;<i> These all consume effort.  None of this effort is needed now.
</I>
Again, we already have this problem with separate clients.  I notice it 
because I'm the release engineer.  I guess it's not your fault that 
you don't.

&gt;<i> But he DOES need to know, because sometimes he wants to run an X program
</I>&gt;<i> and sometimes he wants to run a command line program and he will be baffled
</I>&gt;<i> by when it runs one way and sometimes another seemingly by magic.
</I>
What's your warrant for believing this?  That is, under what circumstances
would a user on an X display want to force the curses version?
