<PRE>Trying to get closure on some stuff in my mailbox...

1. NTP time syncing and magic delays

Gary Miller and Rob Janssen had a long email debate about this.  It
seems to have been resolved, or at least died down.  I'm not aware of
any changes that currently need to be made.  If anyone knows differently,
please tell me.

2. Bathymetry.

Carl Brown requested support for the NMEA INDPT sentence.  A test load
for an NMEA device that emits it has been added to the tests directory, but 
code for parsing INPDT has not been added.  I agree with the list consensus
that adding support for this seems a reasonable extension of what GPSD does.

The simple, obvious solution would be to simply report water depth in
the altitude field, unless we think somebody is going to mount
bathymeters on airplanes.  Gary Miller observed that there are three
'altitudes' at issue:

        altitude of GPS.
        depth of transducer
        offset of transducer to water line.

But &quot;offset of transducer to water line&quot; is a fixed offset that, according
to <A HREF="http://www.humminbird.com/normal.asp?id=853,">http://www.humminbird.com/normal.asp?id=853,</A> has to be programmed into
the bathymetric devices by the customer behind gpsd's back.

I say screw it, gpsd can report the sum of the two as altitude.  This
avoids opening up a *huge* can of worms about extending the gpsd
protocol.

But this decision opens up a (smaller) can of worms.  In theory, we could
now have situations in which the GPS has 'altitude' when it doesn't have
a lat/lon fix!  

Admittedly this is unlikely.  You'd have to be on the water without a
sky view before it could happen.  But the assumption that having
altititude implies a valid 2D fix is probably wired into gpsd in several
places and will have to be sniffed out and removed.

3. Kernel-level bug affecting Garmin binary driver

There were two long threads about problems with the Garmin binary 
driver that apparently turned out to be due to a kernel-level bug
in Linux.  Have we worked up a bug report we can pass to the 
kernel gang?

Don't ever think you know what's right for the other person.
He might start thinking he knows what's right for you.
