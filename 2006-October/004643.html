<PRE>There was a thread at
&lt;<A HREF="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=115940558500017&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=115940558500017&amp;r=1&amp;w=2</A>&gt;, which was
Chris and Gary kicking an extended GPSD protocol design ideas back and
forth.  I'm responding here and have added my comments.

Note: I *love* this sort of thing.  I particularly enjoy writing
compilers, interpreters, language and markup-format and protocol
translators, command parsers, state machines, and anything along those
lines, and I think about this kind of design a lot.  It's not atypical
that my most recent new release is a C-to-Python language translator.
If I can be said to have a specialty within programming, this topic
lands us smack dab in the middle of it.

(And yes, this is part of the reason gpsd has a packet sniffer.  It's
not just that the thing was functionally necessary to get to zero
configuration once I'd decided on that goal -- for me, it was just way
too much fun to pass up.)

Accordingly, I expect to write the extended command parser and its
test framework myself.  Actually you'd probably have to use a crowbar
to pry the job away from me even if I weren't the project lead :-).

Late in the thread, Chris asks the thousand-dollar question:

Chris:
&gt;<i>                      I'm asking a serious question here, to all you
</I>&gt;<i>gpsd users and developers: &quot;how does the current gpsd protocol fail to
</I>&gt;<i>meet your needs?&quot;
</I>
Maybe it doesn't.  Fail, that is.  As much as I love designing 
protocol-like things, my policy has been to put off actually doing
the big command extension as long as possible.  We don't have
a demonstrated need for it yet -- this discussion is design-ahead for 
when we do.  

My goal isn't to get a spec for immediate implementation, but a
consensus we can stash in a design whitepaper on the webnsite
(or in the Hacking Guide) against the day we actually need it.

Gary suggests:
&gt;<i>We could do something like the J command.  Use the old single letters
</I>&gt;<i>by default.  Then step up to the full feature set on request.
</I>
Of course.  That's how it will work.  The old single-character command
set will continue to be supported, if only because it's just slightly
more penurious of bandwidth.  Chris got this right in his response:

Chris:
&gt;<i>I'm not advocating killing off v3... for what it is, I like it. Just
</I>&gt;<i>about everything I need, I get from 'O'. Put that in your pipe and
</I>&gt;<i>smoke it, NMEA!
</I>
Thank you, that *is* the effect I intended when I designed it. :-)  And:

Chris:
&gt;<i>I was going to say that perhaps '@' by itself is special, causing gpsd
</I>&gt;<i>to escalate to v4, but then I remembered the 'L' command. Clients
</I>&gt;<i>wishing to use protocol 4 features must send 'L' first, to see if the
</I>&gt;<i>daemon support v4. From there, the v4 parser can be probed for which
</I>&gt;<i>commands it supports.
</I>
Gary concurred, and so do I.

Now, onto the actual v4 design:

Chris Kuethe wrote (I'm merging in a later thread here):
&gt;<i> There's not much that protocol 3 doesn't give us for standard PVT
</I>&gt;<i> reports. Thus, I'm in favor of using an escape character like @ or ^
</I>&gt;<i> to signal that the following characters need to be fed to the extended
</I>&gt;<i> parser. Then we can have long command names and other goodness...
</I>
&gt;<i>I'd like to suggest for protocol v4 something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>@&lt;cmdA&gt;[:&lt;cmdAparam1&gt;[,&lt;cmdAparam2&gt;[,...,&lt;cmdAparamN&gt;]]];
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So...
</I>&gt;<i>- Command strings are &quot;C&quot; strings.
</I>&gt;<i>- Command names can be some number of alphanumeric characters {0}
</I>&gt;<i>- Command strings must be terminated by a semicolon {1}
</I>&gt;<i>- Commands may have a variable number of parameters
</I>&gt;<i>- Commands are separated from their parameters (if any) by a colon.
</I>&gt;<i>- Reserved characters are colon, semicolon and comma [:;,] - these
</I>&gt;<i>must not be used in a command name or command parameter.
</I>
This is all perfectly sound, IMO, and I might have written the same
spec myself -- that is, there are other styles possible, but this one
is among the simplest and will work.  I would add:

- Whitespace before or after reserved characters is forbidden, 
  except that LF or CR-LF may occur after &quot;;&quot;.

Unlike a short command-length limit, that really *will* simplify the
parser; trust me on this :-).  If the protocol ever needs string literals
we'll allow whitespace within them, of course.

The biggest argument anybody could have with the rest of it is the
introducer character.  In a later post, Chris wrote:

&gt;<i>           That leaves a short list of symbols that would be
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate: @|%^+-/
</I>&gt;<i> '/' might not be bad - people are used to /command in instant
</I>&gt;<i> messaging programs.
</I>&gt;<i> '^' might work - the caret sort of suggests escalating or raising
</I>&gt;<i> '@' might work because one thinks of chat, and email and longer messages
</I>&gt;<i> '+' and '-' have been used as command line flag indicators as ages
</I>&gt;<i> '%' i'm neutral on that, except that it's used as a shell prompt character
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> '|' should be reserved for passthrough mode... pipe. it just feels right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> '$' is bad, because NMEA uses it for a sentence starter
</I>&gt;<i> '*' is bad because NMEA uses it to delimit the checksum
</I>&gt;<i> '=' is bad because we use that as an assignment operator
</I>&gt;<i> '#' is bad because we unix-heads think of it as a comment character
</I>
I'm agreed on Chris's washouts, including |.  I would further wash out
(){}[]&lt;&gt; and both string quotes because we might want to use them
syntactically someday, and besides using half of a paired delimiter
character would just look ugly and never mind that there's some
tradition of using '&gt;' for this.  The '.' is too close to invisible to
make a good introducer, and '\' has an escape-character use in Unix
convention that we're somewhat likely to want later.

But, Chris, I'm wondering why you left out '&amp;' and '!' and '?'.  Any
of those three seem like reasonable introducers to me.  I might favor
'?' over the '@' you're suggesting, in fact.  I'm a bit inclined to
avoid '@' these days because it has become so closely associated with
network addresses

(Feel free to argue from either Unix precedent or inchoate good taste 
in responding.  This choice is all about aesthetics and gut feel; from
a purely technical point of view any of these is as good as any other.)

&gt;<i>- Command strings, including leading '@' and terminating ';\0' shall
</I>&gt;<i>fit into uint8_t buf[1024]. If a ';' is not found before buf[1023],
</I>&gt;<i>the command is not valid and will be discarded. {2}
</I>
Good.  I'll argue about the length limit in a bit.

&gt;<i>- Only one command shall be sent at a time. Even if they take no
</I>&gt;<i>parameters &quot;@cmdA;cmdB;&quot; is not valid. Processing will stop before
</I>&gt;<i>cmdB.{3}
</I>
I don't think this restriction is necessary, though it might be
desirable to simplify error reporting.  More discussion below.

&gt;<i>{0} do we want to allow arbitrarily long command names?
</I>
Gary observed correctly that we're about out of letters.  Chris said
&quot;I wasn't sure if I should allow 3, or 8 or n characters. Y'know...
for parser simplicity.&quot;  

Gary replied:
&gt;<i>When I did parsers in assembly I would care about this.  Not now.
</I>&gt;<i>Even CKermit could do shortest unambiguous match.   Over the 4800
</I>&gt;<i>baud link keeping it short is important, but once we are running
</I>&gt;<i>at TCP/IP speeds to cgps speed is not an issue.
</I>
I think Gary is correct about the (absence of) performance issue here.

Chris replied:
&gt;<i>Sounds like you have more experience than I do at maintaining
</I>&gt;<i>shortest-match parsers - you're saying this is is not a long-term
</I>&gt;<i>maintenance headache, keeping a shortest-match parser up to date?
</I>
Nah.  The code is pretty trivial, even in C.  The basic trick is, you
stash all your leader tokens in an array initializer and write a loop
overr that. The array changes when you extend your command set, but the
shortest-match code doesn't.

(Dunno about Gary but I've written shortest-match recognizers so many
times I probably bang one out while blind drunk.  If I ever drank,
which I don't.)

Given that the implementation language is C, there are really only three
levels of potential complexity here:

0) All commands are one character
1) All commands are strings of length less than some fixed N.
2) Commands may be of any length.

In particular, in C on modern hardware the value of N under case 1 is
not significant -- it's not measurably faster to recognize
32-character commands than it is to recognize 2-character commands.
Nor does that value have any impact on the complexity of the parser,
which is basically going to be a big if/then/else with strcmp() calls
or scanf() calls in the guards.

Yes, we could use a fancier approach like Yacc/Lex, but IMO it would
be overkill.  For this application, with its relatively simple command
set being both emitted and parsed by programs rather than humans, I'll
choose the approach that minimizes code complexity in the parser
rather than maximizing flexibility and robustness near the sorts of
funky edge cases humans emit.

I land squarely on alternative 1, with a maximum command size one less
than our maximum line size (to allow for the introducer character).

The only potential reason to make N smaller is if we are so
obsessively worried about code footprint in embedded systems that the
size of *one single* command buffer makes a difference.  I'm an old
assembler hand too, and I still have a ghost of the same reflex Chris
was displaying (as I'll bet Gary does too).  But it's 2006, I don't
think we have that problem any more.

&gt;<i>{1} if ((buf[strlen(buf) - 1]) != ';') return ERROR; /* nice and easy */
</I>
Gary suggested allowing ';' anywhere in the buffer so multiple commands
could be stacked on a single line.  Chris was mildly against this, arguing
it would keep parsing and error reporting simpler.

I'm fairly neutral on this issue.  Allowing stacking really won't
complicate the parser much; I am so used to this kind of hacking that
I could write the extra layer of state transitions or looping in my
sleep (or blind drunk :-)) and probably get it right.  Gary's comment

&gt;<i>Just use a strchr() in a while() loop  to chop the string at each ';'
</I>
is quite correct.

&gt;<i>{2} is 1023 bytes enough?
</I>
I'm with Gary on this one; like him, I prefer protocols I can fit in an
editor.  SMTP's 76-character soft limit is a bit archaic, but we should 
prefer 78 chars or less per line (yes, I know the Y message violates this).

Chris replied
&gt;<i>You mean you prefer protocols where you can fit the MTU into one
</I>&gt;<i>screenful, preferably one line? I was thinking the same. First I
</I>&gt;<i>though 80 characters, then I though maybe 256 if we're uploading an
</I>&gt;<i>hexdump of an ephemeris, and then I though I might want more. But I
</I>&gt;<i>wanted to go bounded. Either a one-time malloc buffer or a static
</I>&gt;<i>buffer. I'm tempted to allow 4K, because that's a modern memory page.
</I>
MTU size isn't the issue here, it's keeping logs easily browseable and
test loads easily editable that we want.

Trust me, I understand your issue with wanting to keep the protocol
dead simple while supporting data dumps that won't fit on one line.
I've been in this bind myself more than once, and I have a solution.
That is to bite the bullet and allow not multiline commands but 
multiline *responses*.

Here's how it works.  We make the protocol line limit really short.
But we allow a response to consist of more than one line, byte-stuffed
a la SMTP and terminated by a line consisting of a single '.' And
(here's the trivial-sounding but important bit) the clue that a
multiline response is coming is part of the *syntax*, not dispatched
on the semantics of the command.  Thus there would be two kinds of response
to a hypothetical '?X' extended command: single line like this

?X:asdfghjkl;

or multiline like this:

?X:
asdf
ghjkl
.

The handler code for extended-X cannot see the difference; all it knows is 
that it gets back a buffer full of data.

(You know, this time around I'm even kind of tempted to use '.' as the
terminator for both forms.  That would be elegant.  Then, the syntax
rule becomes identical for both cases with all embedded newlines and
the string &quot;\n..&quot; being ignored.)

(Damn shame ASCII doesn't include the Spanish inverted questionmark,
I'd love to make *that* the terminator character for both forms.)

(Did I mention that I get off on doing this sort of design? :-))

Now, your *multiline* response can have a big size limit without having to 
make the maximum line length that big.  And in C or Python, the little 
state machine required to collect it is simple enough to be easily 
maintainable.

&gt;<i>{3} do we want to allow multiple commands on a line, or is it fair
</I>&gt;<i>trade the ability to specify multiple command for the possibility of a
</I>&gt;<i>very rich, extensible command set?
</I>
These things are not mutually contradictory.  We can have both.  The
key point here is that we have unambiguous introducer and terminator
characters in the syntax.  The parser won't *care* whether the
commands are one-per-line or stacked, nor will the code the
parser is driving.  

Gary wrote:
&gt;<i>I much prefer one command per line.  Much easier to debug.  But eric
</I>&gt;<i>has been moving the other way.  If we allow commands to stack on ';',
</I>&gt;<i>like in SQL, then each person can do it his way.
</I>
The only argument for one-per-line is that it means an error report
could unambiguously locate a command by line or sequence number.  I
don't think that's a big deal here.

Chris also suggested:
&gt;<i>I think we should reserve commands of the form &quot;GPSD[A-Z]&quot; which map
</I>&gt;<i>to the version 3 single character commands.
</I>
Gary replied:
&gt;<i>I like that.  That would be a nice gesture to allow quick upgrading of
</I>&gt;<i>clients while opening the door to major updates as well.
</I>
I concur.
