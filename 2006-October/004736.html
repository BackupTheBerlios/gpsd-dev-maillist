<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> One is that there are are a lot of things that gpsd/libgpsd just can
</I>&gt;<i> not do to certain GPS.  Things like changing the speed in garmin serial
</I>&gt;<i> binary mode are especially gnarly.
</I>
Why can't gpsd do this?  

Or, to put the question more precisely: What prevents us from adding
this as a capability to whatever driver in libgpsd(3) is handling
Garmin serial binary?  I mean, it's all C shipping control strings
down device file descriptors, right?

&gt;<i> The second is that having a differently coded decoder has been usefull
</I>&gt;<i> for debugging.
</I>
OK, but be prepared to throw the prototype away.  I fear deeply the
consequences of having our maintenance capability spread among
redundant driver implementations.  I see that I have led us into error
by the example of sirfmon; I'll have to fix that.

&gt;<i> Otherwise I see that this can allow for changing the GPS behavior
</I>&gt;<i> while running which is a requested feature.
</I>
Go through the daemon whenever possible, rather than around it.  It's a rule.
In truth, I don't expect the lowlevel code branch will be used often.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Adding an option to preset the driver type rather than going through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the hunt loop, so the tool doesn't depend on packet.c, is left as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; utterly trivial exercise -- hint: look at the function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd_switch_driver() in libgpsd_core.c.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This will be key as a core function of the *ctl is switching from
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA to proprietary modes and back.
</I>
I understand that. But normally you shouldn't ever have to specify a 
driver type to switch modes, because gpsctrl will figure out what kind it's
looking at exactly the same way that gpsd does.

Hmm...that reminds me, there's a test I should add to the guard code
so the GPS isn't perturbed when it's already in the mode you want.

&gt;<i> If Chris can make this work for SiRF I can make it work for Garmin.
</I>
Excellent.
