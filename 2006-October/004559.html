GPSD,O=PTNTHTM ? 0.005 ? ? 59.10 ? ? 285.1000 10.700 -2.400 ? ? ? 3

In the 'O' message that is generated from PTHTHM there is. And clients
trying to parse that message would fail.

&gt;<i> &gt; What about using other messages, like &quot;IAVT&quot;.

Gpsd will accept combination commands - &quot;SPAMQTV&quot; for example - check
the manpage to see what that would produce.

# echo IAVT | nc 127.0.0.1 2947
GPSD,I=True North,A=59.100,V=20.799,T=285.1000

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe we could zero the fields, and hope that truenorth users read the

</I>
Truenorth.c seems to be working well enough. It's the NMEA parser
whose behaviour needs to be investigated. I think it's doing the job
correctly.

&gt;<i> Currently with Rev. 3612 I get a bit more, but not correct:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Of course I can decide which values are the right one for me but the
</I>&gt;<i> values are wrong.
</I>
I now direct you to the source code... nmea_parse.c:494. Read and
understand. Cgps will try convert whatever it gets back from gpsd into
the units you want. As I think we've said before, we're stuffing the
data we get back from the truenorth into fields not designed to hold
those quantities.

This was a bit of a tough decision because we're a) pretty much out of
single letter commands in gpsd protocol v3 and b) extending an
existing message is likely break older clients in a very big way.
Thus, we just stuff the quantities into a message, pass it on, and let
you convert them.

I will leave it to Jeff to decide if he wants to extend cgps to have a
unitless-display-of-wire-protocol mode, perhaps invoked by
GPSD_UNITS=&quot;none&quot;.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
