<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; gpspipe has your name in it.  But if it's orphaned, that's fine.  It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ought to be replaced by a small handful of Python, anyway; there's no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good reason for it to be in C.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Systems that don't have python. No compelling reason to kill something
</I>&gt;<i> that small.
</I>
Where do you think we ought to draw the line?   Here's what I put in the
Hacking Guide:

    &lt;p&gt;The project implementation languages are C and Python.  The core
    libgpsd libraries (and the daemon, which is a thin wrapper around
    them) are written in C; the test and profiling tools are written in
    Python.  Code in other languages will, in general, be accepted only if
    it supplies a language binding for the libgps or libgpsd libraries
    that we don't already have.  This restriction is an attempt to keep
    our long-term maintenance problem as tractable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We require C for anything that may have to run on an embedded
    system. Thus, the daemon and libgpsd libraries need to stay pure C.
    Anything that links direct to the core libraries should also be in C,
    because Python's alien-type facilities are still just a little too
    complex and painful to be a net win for our situation. (We know this
    may be about to change with the advent of the ctypes module in Python
    2.6 and will keep an open mind, especially to anyone who actually 
    supplies a ctypes Python wrapper for libgpsd.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We prefer Python anywhere we aren't required to to use C by
    technical constraints &mdash; test/profiling/logging tools, hotplug agents,
    and miscellaneous scripts.  Again, this is a long-term maintainability
    issue; there are whole classes of potential C bugs that simply don't
    exist in Python, and Python programs have a drastically lower line
    count for equivalent capability.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't think any of this would be controversial.  But if you find any
of the premises or conclusions in the above wacky, please do say so.  That
goes for the other senior developers and committers, too.

By all means let's have this discussion about gpspipe, because it sits
on a couple of interesting boundaries.

gpspipe has two major use cases: 

1) As a test tool (witness the role it just played in the J mess).

2) As a generator for shell pipelines or logger processes picking up
   GPS activity from remote systems.  

Here's a brute fact: On systems that don't have Python, pretty much
our entire set of test tools goes up the spout.  gpsfake won't work,
gpsprof ditto, and the valgrind-audit check won't run either.  And our
normal regression tests depend on gpsfake.

What I'm saying is that we're already so dependent on Python for test
tools that one more can't make our exposure any worse.  So just
raising &quot;systems that don't have Python&quot; as an objection to writing
test tools in Python (or moving them from C to Python) is kind of weak
and funny.  And that pretty much takes care of case 1.

(Now me, I don't view lots of Python as &quot;exposure&quot; -- if I were tempted
to, I'd just reflect that every line of Python substitutes for many lines
of C we don't have to maintain.  I think of all the lovely buffer overruns, 
stale-pointer bugs, and stack smashes we'll never have to cope with and
I smile.)

On to case 2.  Maybe you can persuade me that I'm wrong, but I just
can't easily visualize this kind of activity being *hosted* on a
system too small for Python.  Sure, I can see collecting data from an
SBC in a balloon somewhere using gpspipe, but it's 2006 -- if the 
collecting system has enough marbles to do shell pipelines, requiring
Python just isn't a big deal anymore.  (It has a *much* smaller 
installation footprint than Perl...)

But the real reason I want to move that code is that it's ugly.  It
was a grubby, fast-and-dirty hack when Gary originally wrote it and
it hasn't gotten any prettier since.  Time to rewrite -- and since 
I think I can collapse that 331 lines into maybe 40 lines of Python
that seems like the way to go.

My mind is open to counterarguments, however.
