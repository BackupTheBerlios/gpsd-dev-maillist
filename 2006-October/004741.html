I was going to take time today to hack on TSIP... but the vendor
shipped the wrong I/O board. grr.

I'm sure I would've arrived at the same thing... eventually. I just
prefer to hack on smaller, self-contained widgets. But I was thinking
&quot;what parts of this do we already have that I can reuse?&quot;

&gt;<i> Now, Chris, please do us all a favor.  You're the guy with the major use

Gary needs to test too. He's fighting with that linux kernel usb
insanity, and mentioned something about continuing to try get the
speed switching magic working.

As Gary said below, these simple standalone tools are good for
developing and designing a technique before rolling it into the main
daemon.

Look for these to be killed off within the next couple of weeks. iTrax
will stick around a little while, until I get something resembling a
useful binary decoder working. TSIP is next, once I get the right I/O
board. I've heard reports of certain Trimbles getting very confused.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
