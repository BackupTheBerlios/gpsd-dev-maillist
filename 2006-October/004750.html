I tried GPSD_UNITS and I've seen the difference in cgps. gpsd isn't
affected by that env?

Using libgpsmm.h/gps.h I would desire a way to get also raw data from
gpsd and doing the only converting by the client software. That would
avoid multiple converting.

The TNTC provides following data types:
Angles in degrees (0.0 to 359.9&#176;), mils (0 to 6399), milliradians (0 to
6282), or 16-bit integer (0 &#8211; 65535)

Choosing 16-bit I get a far better data accuracy (more accurate then the
sensor is).

Getting deeper into using svn I've seen according to prior discussions:


r3424 | esr | 2006-08-31 22:50:59 +0200 (Do, 31 Aug 2006) | 7 lines

Design decision: Trie North data gets mapped into existing fields
(track, etc) rather than new ones like heading.  This gets rid of the
HEADING_FIX code contributed but not compiled in by default.


What was bad about having TNTC-specific or other specific fields in
gpsd? Any gps-software wouldn't look for them as they are not typical
gps fields. I don't see a collision. Thus we would have pitch in degree
and I wouldn't need a flag for raw data.

Regards,
Massimo
