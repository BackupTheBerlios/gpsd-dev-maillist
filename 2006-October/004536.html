No kidding. I'm thinking of the &quot;synchronize protocol and baud rate&quot;
feature of SiRFdemo, or my equivalent sirftool which just spams the
device with control messages that would, under reasonable
circumstances, have the effect you're after.

Using SiRF as an example, I build the speed/protocol message for NMEA
and binary, and then spew that at the receiver at each supported
speed. Hopefully it works. For what its worth, my tool with my timings
works better than the SiRF tool.

This is the same approach I am taking with my itrax3 - send it the
requisite control messages at each speed and hope it works.

&gt;<i> &gt; i could entertain the concept of a unified front end
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ./gpsctl -t /dev/tty00
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     try probe the device. good for testing the device probes.
</I>
&gt;<i> Well, see, there is the rub.  The reason I created garmintool was to
</I>&gt;<i> get out from under the big probe thing in gpsd.  gpsd is meant to be
</I>&gt;<i> zero config and autodetect everything.  But that makes the probe
</I>&gt;<i> loop big/ugly/slow and hard to modfify.
</I>
this is a great way to test that big/ugly/slow probe mechanism. Or
develop a better one. The problem with using the current probe is that
it tries really hard to do autodetection, and the various supported
speeds make that difficult. I chould define probe behaviour to require
the speed to be specified.

For the moment, I have a detector that takes less than 1 second to
determine the speed and protocol of an itrax receiver running at 4800
- 230400.

Reconfiguring a SiRF takes a bit longer because I do tcdrain after
every write and then wait a bit for the receiver to parse it. Still,
in 2 or 3 seconds you've got your receiver set up just the way you
like it.

&gt;<i> I created garmintool because I did not see an easy way to integrate
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol changing in packet.c without substantial effort and
</I>&gt;<i> risk for breakage of other parts I can not test.
</I>
I applaud your tact and prudence.

&gt;<i> One documented justification for sirfmon is that is uses a different
</I>&gt;<i> set of routines that can be compared against those in gpsd for
</I>&gt;<i> testing.
</I>
It's designed to be a sanity check on the data decode, but it's port
handling is a bit primitive.

&gt;<i> If these 3 modules are integrated in to one then there will be confusion
</I>&gt;<i> since the capabilites and support for each cevice is very different.
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd is to support the commonality with zero config and the separate
</I>&gt;<i> tools support the quirks for the advanced user.
</I>
Right. The daemon is intended to be zero config. I'm all for that. The
associated data tools get it pretty right, too.

I see sirfmon or sirfproto or garmintool or itraxctl as configuration
tools for advanced users. A large part of what they'd be used for
(speed and protocol) is common to all of them, so that could be a
maybe migrate to a separate front end.

&gt;<i> OTOH, having a nice single front end for folks to use would be a
</I>&gt;<i> good thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I see problems and opportunites.  If the gpsctl was mostly a
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper around standard, but separate, device specific modules then
</I>&gt;<i> I could support this.
</I>
I think that's where I'm headed. Some standard serial stuff, some
common getopt glue, a generic dispatcher, and then some protocol
specific modules to compute the nmea and binary control messages that
the receiver gets spammed with. :)

Once I get my itrax tool working, I'll refactor it and my sirf tool
into a more generic ... &quot;protocol droid&quot;.

Thanks for the input.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
