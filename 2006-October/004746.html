We're talking past each other, or something.  I know some device types have 
weird requirements.  But this doesn't mean the tool has to *start off* by
knowing the type.  As long as it can deduce the type before having to
do the special operation, we win.

So, in this case, I'd look for a way for the SiRF driver to detect that 
it's dealing with a BU-353 (I found the the firmware revision number 
was often a valuable clue when I was writing the SiRF driver).  Then I'd
make &quot;beat it over the head 8 times&quot; what the driver does when it has
detected a BU-353.  

In two years of dealing with wildly perverse devices, I have stumbled
over *exactly one* GPS chipset for which this strategy (autodetect
followed by special-casing) will not work.  I forget the model number,
but it generated bad sentence checksums when it didn't have a fix.
That was too much, it undermined the autodetect mechanism enough that
I said to hell with it.

I keep hearing people say that knowing the device type in advance is
critical in weird edge case X, but except in that one case this has
*never* turned out to be the case when I pushed hard enough.
 
&gt;<i> I don't have any bluetooth gear but I've had at least 3 reports from
</I>&gt;<i> bluetooth/SiRF users where the autobaud/probe/protocol switch gets the
</I>&gt;<i> UART/protocol engine/bluetooth spp all confused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both of these have, on a couple of occasions, been remedied by a
</I>&gt;<i> standalone tool...
</I>
Well, yeah.  So what?  The argument here isn't standalone tool vs.
gpsd, it's having all the type-specific magic in one driver object 
as opposed to scattered about in several different places.
