</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The problem with PPS is that you get exact information about the start

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only thing I have ever found about the relationship between the pps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pulse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the time message is that the pulse is for the second of the next time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message arriving. Did not say how long it would take for the message to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arrive, but implies that it is less than a second.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since I can't find the source of that information any more, it is of low
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authority.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OTOH, it just makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, which part of the problem do I not understand?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that I don't know, but at least I know what is written above is
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect.
</I>
It can not be incorrect, since it is not a statement of fact, but a stated 
requirement from the documentation of a GPS receiver with a pps pin.
I don't want to split hairs here, but I am getting a bit confused by some of 
your wording.

&gt;<i> What I find when analyzing the output of various receivers is that the
</I>&gt;<i> time indicated in messages is always behind the moment they are actually
</I>&gt;<i> sent.
</I>
I don't understand this sentence. As a mental crutch for me lets assume the 
GPS has a pps pin.
Are you saying the message containing the time of the last pps signal is sent 
X milliseconds after the pps signal was asserted?

&gt;<i> By how much, that differs from receiver to receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> And also, it often varies a little when looking at one single receiver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that is correct and understandable. It does not violate the above 
requirement.

&gt;<i> So, looking only at time in messages and at the moment those arrive, you
</I>&gt;<i> get only poor time information.  Do not trust it to remain accurate within
</I>&gt;<i> 0.5 second, and without taking measurements don't rely on it being
</I>&gt;<i> accurate within 2 seconds.
</I>
I fully agree with the 500ms part, but would call the two seconds part broken.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is actually happening is that the time in messages is not the current
</I>&gt;<i> time, and this is usually not claimed either.  The time in messages is a
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp of the measurement taken.  The receiver calculates a fix, and as
</I>&gt;<i> the result of this calculation it has a time and location.  This
</I>&gt;<i> information is stored in memory and a separate process ships out this
</I>&gt;<i> stored information later.  How much later, that varies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is also correct.

&gt;<i> PPS is a different matter, this is locked as well as possible to the
</I>&gt;<i> internally synchronized clock of the receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> And, sometimes there is a special message in binary mode that has a
</I>&gt;<i> specified relation to PPS.   This message is much more accurate than the
</I>&gt;<i> timestamps found in position messages.  I am not aware of such a defined
</I>&gt;<i> message in NMEA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, the only mention I ever found for a GPS with pps pulse was the promise 
that any NMEA messages (or binary for that matter) containing time would have 
the exact time of the preceding pps pulse.

&gt;<i> My experience with receivers (others can add theirs):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SiRF-I: timestamps in messages arrive about 800 ms after indicated time.
</I>&gt;<i>         dedicated PPS message is defined but cannot be sent by my receiver.
</I>&gt;<i>         who has a receiver recent enough to check it?
</I>
That would be acceptable.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Zodiac: timestamps arrive about 1100ms after indicated time
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That would be broken according to someones requirement.

&gt;<i> Trimble: dedicated time message exists that arrives about 75ms late
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Acceptable.

&gt;<i> NMEA:   someone (don't remember who) had a receiver that lagged 675ms
</I>
Acceptable.

&gt;<i>         others can be off by more than 1 second.
</I>&gt;<i>         reports on internet indicate that some receivers can vary the
</I>&gt;<i>         delay over more than one second interval.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Broken.

&gt;<i> So it is clear that no reliable PPS synchronization can be done without
</I>&gt;<i> first measuring the delay of timestamps, when that is the only reference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Finally, lets make sure we agree we are talking only about GPS with pps 
pin/signal. I don't care if a GPS without pps is 2000ms behind, I would just 
throw it away.

If a company sells you a GPS with pps and does not give you a defined way to 
find out what second a pulse belongs to, I'd consider it broken/buggy.

Maybe that is the reality out there, then we will have to deal with it. You 
know this better than anybody here, since you have run the tests.

If I look at the problem correctly, there are three distinct cases.

1. A message containing time of the pps pulse arrives before the next pps 
pulse (0 to 999ms late). You just take this time, add one second, and the 
next time you see a pps pulse you know its correct second.

2. A message containing time of the pps pulse arrives a fixed number seconds 
late( n seconds + 0 to 999ms late). Add a fixed number of seconds, and then 
goto 1.

3. A message containig.... arrives a variable number of seconds late. Throw 
the GPS away.

I consider 1. common and correct, 2. hopefully uncommon, but usable.
The third should be very uncommon, and I'd hope we could avoid coding for such 
an uncommon case.

In neither case should we have to fiddle with per device subsecond offsets.

Did I get it right this time?

Cheers,
Remco
