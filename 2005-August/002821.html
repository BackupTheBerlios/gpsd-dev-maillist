<PRE>&gt;<i> Hey, it was broken, totally, in my case.  When I asked about a fix,
</I>&gt;<i> no one had one.
</I>
I must have missed that message.  I read this list but I might miss
something especially when it is buried somewhere in a larger message.


&gt;&gt;<i> Moving constants to timebase.h is a good idea, but it won't solve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem in your case.  For that, the extra functionality of a table of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receiver types and time offsets is required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was under the impression that he only wanted comments in that file
</I>&gt;<i> for now?  Got a better place to put a table of observations?
</I>
Well that table certainly does not belong there.
I think we need some place where a default offset can be stored (maybe per
protocol but it would need to be copied to the session) and it should be
possble to overwrite it when a known receiver is detected or a better
value is passed somehow.
Currently the code uses constant values.  Replacing them with #defines
from a .h file will not improve anything other than readability.  For a
real improvement we need a variable that can be tuned.


&gt;&gt;<i> For your own testing, you can modify the 0.675 in drivers.c until your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message time is in sync with your PPS time, or at least is well within
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 400ms of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now THAT is new info.  I had not noticed that.  That changes some things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When, as just a test, I remove your 0.675 offset I see that my offset
</I>&gt;<i> is really 1.077 Sec.  Talk about being 1 Sec off.
</I>
This is similar to Zodiac/Jupiter receivers.  It probably consists of
about a second of lag between the fix calculation and the output process,
plus some 77ms of delay because of the serial link.


&gt;<i> I doubt it is easier for the user to change the fudge in the code and
</I>&gt;<i> recompile than to change the fudge in the ntp.conf and restart ntpd.
</I>
I don't agree with that.   Large userbases of Linux systems download
or purchase binary distributions and never compile from source.  They
can edit a configuration file (maybe via some GUI), but they do not edit
and compile source.

&gt;<i> If we can, and I doubt we can, figure out the fudge automatically, then
</I>&gt;<i> it belongs in our code.  If we can not IMHO the fudge belongs where the
</I>&gt;<i> the ntpd admin expects it.  That respects the principle of least surprise.
</I>
The fudge between a message time and reasonably correct real time can
be handled this way, but not between message time and PPS time, because
NTP does not see this information and we cannot readback the fudge values
from NTP via the shm structure.
Looking at the system time instead of the message time is not a good idea
as I have explained before.


&gt;<i> Just trying to cover all the possible solutions.  Until we have a working
</I>&gt;<i> solution we need to look at all the possibilities.  Nothing so far is
</I>&gt;<i> even close to 500mS.
</I>
This problem is specific to your use of NMEA.
NMEA is not a suitable protocol for this purpose, imho.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, we need to apply some fudge factor to bring all known GPS receivers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within a few hundred milliseconds of correct time (the 400 already was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> highest I wanted to go, other implementations of PPS locking recommend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to go higher than 250).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because of the ambiguity of which second, I do not see how the old
</I>&gt;<i> solution
</I>&gt;<i> would prevent locking on the wrong second.  By your own admission some
</I>&gt;<i> GPS take 1.5 seconds to output the time.  Subtract your fudge of 0.675 and
</I>&gt;<i> we end up within the old 400mS window.  Viola, the old code locks on to
</I>&gt;<i> the wrong second.
</I>
Before I implemented time support in gpsd, I wrote software to handle
this standalone, and I studied the matter.  I decided that I needed to
use binary protcol.  Even then, it usually wanders, but remains within
usable tolerances to use PPS to lock to the correct second.
I have also seen others remark that they could not get really reliable
results with NMEA, for example users of Jupiter receivers report that
sometimes the delay jumps up or down by one second (suggesting the
independent processes of fix and serial output have slipped enough to have
one result more or less in the pipeline).

My implementation in gpsd was first for SiRF, then Zodiac, then TSIP.
Someone else added the call for NMEA and reported that timesync now also
works on NMEA, but I think he was overly optimistic.
On the other hand, it is of course better than wristwatch time.

Now that you combine that with accurate PPS output, the fault shows up.


&gt;<i> Well, in my case, when we settle this, I am going to try to get binary
</I>&gt;<i> protocol on the serial garmin.  Wanna bet the fudge factor is within 10%
</I>&gt;<i> of the NMEA one for the same device?  OTOH, I expect half the jitter.
</I>
It depends on whether the Garmin binary protocol is any good.
Check if they support some message that claims to report correct time,
with  reference to PPS, instead of merely containing a timestamp of
measurement.
On my Trimble receiver it works very well.
