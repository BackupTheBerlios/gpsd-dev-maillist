</I>&gt;<i> Point of interest for those worried about me saying &quot;sleep(1)&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> maybe sleeping a bit too long: it's nigh-impossible to get SiRF
</I>&gt;<i> receivers to output solutions (even in binary mode) faster than 1Hz.
</I>&gt;<i> At least with very aggressive polling I wasn't able to get solutions
</I>&gt;<i> out any faster. I have a few things to try yet, but I think I'm
</I>&gt;<i> running into a firmware limitation. SS2e (and e/LP) hardware may
</I>&gt;<i> capable of 5Hz solutions - the marketing bumph says that over 90% of
</I>&gt;<i> the cpu is available for user tasks, which implies that if the
</I>&gt;<i> firmware would let us, we could run solutions a lot more frequently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Well, I never wanted to poll faster than 1Hz (as you say correctly, there is
hardly a receiver that can do that). I simply think that with sleep(1) you
can't poll at 1Hz as you need time to actually poll, parse and write  before
you hit sleep(1) and this time will sum up somewhen to 1 sec which means you
will miss the next data from the receiver.
But we already discussed that and I don't want to start it again =)
Personally I would prefer enhancing the C version to match the perl version.
I'd volunteer to do that on the pretext that the necessary updates to gpsd
itself are accepted by whoever is responsible =)

Cheers
Tobias
