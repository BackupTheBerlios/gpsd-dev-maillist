<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Surprisingly, the serial-only time from the units (once corrected for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their sawtooth clock slip) is quite good.  The problem is just that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> garmin didn't document how to get the GPS's estimate of the clock skew
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out of their gps's and that information hasn't been reverse engineered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for too many different units.  The GPS's of course know their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clock skew to much better than 2 seconds or else they wouldn't be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to calculate their position to less than a lunar-radius.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The receiver does not need to keep time to find a solution when it has
</I>&gt;<i> enough channels.  Very early receivers hopped between satellites and
</I>&gt;<i> needed a very stable clock to make consequtive measurements that could
</I>&gt;<i> later be related to eachother, but a receiver less than 5 years old just
</I>&gt;<i> has 12 channels and measures them all in parallel.  With 4 or more
</I>&gt;<i> satellites in view a position plus time can be calculated from that.
</I>
That was what I though I was saying, or at least though I was
saying. ;-) The highly accurate time knowledge the receiver has does
have to come from the fact that it has just solved for (x_pos, y_pos,
z_pos, time).  As an example I tried to point out that the receiver's
clock time is obviously not being used for the position solution since
the time error is enough to account for a sphere who's surface is past
where the moon orbits.  I thought that was a pretty graphical example
of why the clock obviously wasn't being used for anything of value.  ;-)

&gt;<i> In other receiver's documentation one can read that the clock is kept with
</I>&gt;<i> a millisecond and reset when it deviates more, and that also clearly does
</I>&gt;<i> not mean that the accuracy of position is similar to 1ms of light travel.
</I>
This might be a good thing to put in the list of supported devices.
It might help steer folks to the better receivers.

&gt;<i> I still think the main problem is that timestamps in messages are not an
</I>&gt;<i> indication of current time, but are time-of-fix.  Yet it is attempted to
</I>&gt;<i> treat them as current time.
</I>
Some GPS's also seem to project the solution forward in time, I assume
to try to hide the fact that they are really running on anemic little
CPU's.  There was aviation engineer testing real gps's by driving
endless loops around the perimeter of airport runways.  Seems that
quite a few gps's had &quot;funnies&quot; around the time of the right angle
turns consistent with them projecting their positions forward and only
later realizing that the user had just turned by 90 degrees.

I'm pretty sure the garmins do this, at least some of the time.  You
can hold your hand over their antenna and watch the solution being
projected for the next 30 seconds before it decides to stop the bluff.

I'm pretty sure my motorola oncore also projects the solution into the
future.  It has the position solution (with the current time) ready
much too quickly after the full second comes around.  This is a GPS
that only has enough horse-power to do 1 hz position solutions.  One
would assume it is using most of a second of CPU time to generate this
solution.

&gt;<i> Because GPS receivers run multitasking kernels, and the different
</I>&gt;<i> processes often are not tightly locked to another, you can see slipping
</I>&gt;<i> delays between generation of data and shipping it to the serial port.  Add
</I>&gt;<i> to that the queueing and transmission delays over a slow serial port and
</I>&gt;<i> you get the situation that the data received in the PC can be over one
</I>&gt;<i> second old even when there is no more than a single stored position that
</I>&gt;<i> is calculated and shipped every second.
</I>
Sure.  This is something you have to keep in mind.  It would also be
good to do a quick sanity check to see the extent of this slippage.
Graphing the &quot;gps_time - ntp_time&quot; for a while will quickly show one
how good a certain gps is.
