<PRE>&gt;<i> I do not know how to get the channel number.  Am I missing something?
</I>&gt;<i> Or are you assumeing that the postiion in the GPGSV statements maps

</I>
I think in protocols where you have no information about the channel
number you can use a method like that.  It will not be worse than what we
have now.
In binary protocols the channel numbers are either explicitly available,
or are implicit in that the message contains an array of information items
where each position in the array corresponds with a channel.
In the current drivers such arrays are scanned and only the active
channels are copied into the gpsdata arrays (usually by using two index
variables, one in the message and one in gpsdata, and incrementing the
second one only after seeing an active channel).
By removing that second index and copying everything to the same index
position in gpsdata as where it was found in the message, we simplify the
code and reduce problems.

Using PRN as an index is kind of difficult.  When I receive a message that
says &quot;channel #3 receives PRN #16  (az=128 el=30 signal=40dB)&quot; I can store
that in element #16 of the array, but what about the previous use of that
channel?  Maybe the same channel was used for PRN #30 before, and element
30 of the array still has that data.  Then we would have to scan every
time to see if the same channelnumber was used for a different satellite
before.

Besides that, at least the Jupiter Zodiac software can use more than one
channel for the same PRN.  During startup, it first loads the same PRN to
all channels and starts hunting for the signal.  It changes the PRN every
few seconds, but puts it in all channels.  Presumably each channel is
hunting at a different code phase angle, all of them in parallel.
This would be no problem when using the channel number as an index, but
with PRN as index all info would overwrite the same entry.
