<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> First I should say I am not very happy about the situation we are in.
</I>&gt;<i> I have written the NTP support for gpsd, and my only access to the SVN is
</I>&gt;<i> by patches sent via Eric.
</I>&gt;<i> Suddenly I find an announcement here that someone has modified code to
</I>&gt;<i> adapt it to the needs of his own receiver, and I find myself in the
</I>&gt;<i> position where I have to defend each decision and have to beg to get
</I>&gt;<i> changes out of there.
</I>
Rob, I recall offering you svn access, specifically so you could
maintain the NTP code yourself, and having you turn it down.  That
offer is still open.  You are right to be concerned about your code
being broken by people who understand the problem less well than you --
but to the extent you feel helpless in this situation, that feeling is
solely of your own making.
 
&gt;<i> I would have appreciated it if a possible problem was just posted here on
</I>&gt;<i> the list and discussed as usual, and then a solution could be found that
</I>&gt;<i> satisfies everyone.  When each change is just committed and later
</I>&gt;<i> announced, hopefully to be picked up by other maintainers, we are much
</I>&gt;<i> more likely to run into quality control problems.
</I>
In general this is good advice.  One of the responsibilities of committers
on a group project like this is to be aware of what pieces of the code other
people own and don't want to have others messing with casually.  And
(which is not quite the same issue) which pieces aren't *safe* to mess
with casually.

Rob is territorial about his code. More so than I am, but that's a
legitimate position and should be respected.  All of us should try to
notice each others' thresholds for this sort of thing and be sensitive
to them.

I'm actually happy that I'm seeing substantial commit activity that
isn't from me -- I consider it a sign of the project's health -- but 
let's all give a little thought to how to avoid code thrash and play nice.
