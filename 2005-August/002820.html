Well, that I don't know, but at least I know what is written above is
incorrect.
What I find when analyzing the output of various receivers is that the
time indicated in messages is always behind the moment they are actually
sent.
By how much, that differs from receiver to receiver.
And also, it often varies a little when looking at one single receiver.

So, looking only at time in messages and at the moment those arrive, you
get only poor time information.  Do not trust it to remain accurate within
0.5 second, and without taking measurements don't rely on it being
accurate within 2 seconds.

What is actually happening is that the time in messages is not the current
time, and this is usually not claimed either.  The time in messages is a
timestamp of the measurement taken.  The receiver calculates a fix, and as
the result of this calculation it has a time and location.  This
information is stored in memory and a separate process ships out this
stored information later.  How much later, that varies.

PPS is a different matter, this is locked as well as possible to the
internally synchronized clock of the receiver.
And, sometimes there is a special message in binary mode that has a
specified relation to PPS.   This message is much more accurate than the
timestamps found in position messages.  I am not aware of such a defined
message in NMEA.

My experience with receivers (others can add theirs):

SiRF-I: timestamps in messages arrive about 800 ms after indicated time.
        dedicated PPS message is defined but cannot be sent by my receiver.
        who has a receiver recent enough to check it?

Zodiac: timestamps arrive about 1100ms after indicated time

Trimble: dedicated time message exists that arrives about 75ms late

NMEA:   someone (don't remember who) had a receiver that lagged 675ms
        others can be off by more than 1 second.
        reports on internet indicate that some receivers can vary the
        delay over more than one second interval.

So it is clear that no reliable PPS synchronization can be done without
first measuring the delay of timestamps, when that is the only reference.
