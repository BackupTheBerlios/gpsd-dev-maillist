I agree in general.

Question: why are we running at an elevated priority? That is dangerous. Do we 
really have to?

As to the select() -&gt; read() -&gt; EINTR | EAGAIN:

I have spent a long time researching this five years back. The result was that 
you can safely ignore EINTR and EAGAIN in this setup. You can simply enter 
select() again and it will return the same fd as ready again. No harm done.

The case I was concerned about was a fast busy loop because of repeated 
immediate EAGAINs. I could not come up with a case that that happens, except 
caused by a bug in the OS. In which case the game is over anyways.

At least that is what I remember.
