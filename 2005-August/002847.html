</I>
Ah... you're worried about the overhead of sleep() and other stuff.
I'm not. If you'd like to profile the code and see how long it takes
to run so we can say sleep(1-$small_fudge_factor) , fine, but make
sure it's right to all possible platforms. You can start by checking
the return value of sleep (see the Time::HiRes documentation).
Seriously, unless your system is thrashing into oblivion I can't see
this being a problem. A 400MHz XScale (ARM) swapping to a microdrive
is probably going to hurt your sleep() performance. A Real Computer or
a Well Designed System is not going to have that problem.

I don't think hard disk activity is going to be a serious problem if I
turn off autoflush on the output file descriptor. That a) tends to
speed up output by about 10% and b) allows the buffer cache to
schedule a good time to write the logs. Anyway, I was targetting
gpxlogger at people who want a quick and easy way to take gpsd and
make gpx logs to feed into some app that groks gpx. For higher
resolution applications, I'd suggest writing a custom tool.

As I'm not fond of providing solutions to problems that don't exist,
under what circumstances are you running gpsd and gpxlogger where your
system is so loaded and thrashing so hard that you can't find a moment
every minute to flush a couple of KB to disk? If your system resource
are that tight, perl may not be the tool for the job.

&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be better to
</I>&gt;<i> poll gpsd as often as possible and handle write period via the transmitted
</I>&gt;<i> fix timepoint?
</I>
Probably not. polling on subsecond intervals is probably silly, both
because it'll generate un-necessary network traffic and because
there's a non-zero chance the GPS data won't get refreshed more than
once a second anyway.

&gt;<i> It might be also a good idea to add a
</I>&gt;<i> write-as-often-as-possible option (writing whenever a new fix time is
</I>&gt;<i> polled). The same code could also check for lon and lat. No need to write a
</I>&gt;<i> new waypoint if the gps hasn't moved ;-)
</I>
&quot;-i 1&quot; is effectively as often as possible. NMEA output and probably
most vendor binary protocols only give one solution per second unless
you make a heroic effort to convince your receiver otherwise. Plus,
there is very often some noise in the least significant digits of the
position and/or altitude. Often every second. Which means you'd have a
new position to write every second unless your receiver was doing
static navigation. Also, I'd rather have my raw tracklogs be more or
less continous, and filter out duplicated points during
postprocessing. I suppose I could hack in an option to effectively
&quot;uniq&quot; adjacent fixes, but I'm not likely to use it on a regular
basis.

I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but I don't understand the problem you
wish to solve.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
