<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hey, it was broken, totally, in my case.  When I asked about a fix,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; no one had one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I must have missed that message.  I read this list but I might miss
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something especially when it is buried somewhere in a larger message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anything that gets caught in 24 hourse, much less before a release is
</I>&gt;<i> prety good.  Given some of the previous gpsd releases this is great. :-)
</I>
I thought there had been a question like &quot;why don't I get PPS sync from my
new receiver even though everything is connected and I am within 420ms&quot; on
this list and you got no reply, and I thought I missed that message.
I did not miss the message that you changed things, but when I had seen
that first message I could have come up with changing that 0.675 instead
of the max offset, and we could have discussed ways of tuning that value
without getting upset about unwarranted changes to ntpshm.c

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Moving constants to timebase.h is a good idea, but it won't solve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; problem in your case.  For that, the extra functionality of a table
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; receiver types and time offsets is required.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I was under the impression that he only wanted comments in that file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for now?  Got a better place to put a table of observations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well that table certainly does not belong there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, pick a place.  I really do not care where it is.  If it can be
</I>&gt;<i> automatic then great, if it has to be manual, then that is OK.  You
</I>&gt;<i> choose.
</I>
I think the value has to be in one of the dynamic datastructures.
But I am not jumping to a solution yet as I realize that there may be two
different offsets we want to set for a binary protocol: one for the
timestamp info that is available in all protocols, and one for the
dedicated PPS message that is available in some protocols but usually not
in all versions of it.
(so some receivers may have to rely on a timestamp where others have real
time info, which has less offset.  see sirf.c)

&gt;&gt;<i> The fudge between a message time and reasonably correct real time can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be handled this way, but not between message time and PPS time, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NTP does not see this information and we cannot readback the fudge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> values
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from NTP via the shm structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who needs the fudge after the ntpd has the correct time?  Either the
</I>&gt;<i> PPS lines up on the 'true' time unit, or it does not.
</I>
You keep missing the chicken-and-egg issue that you have when trying to
sync to PPS when not yet being locked to some absolute time info.  You
cannot make PPS lock onto true time unless you know what that is, and when
only an unknown NMEA GPS receiver is connected you don't know that.  And
when you are not locked you cannot know the offset of message time
relative to PPS.

The only reasonable way to make ntpd lock to correct time, is to first let
it lock to an absolute source (the message time), and when it is within a
reasonable difference of that source let it then lock to PPS.  This is
done in ntpshm.c by withholding PPS info to ntpd until ntpd has set the
system time to within 400ms of the received PPS.  As you cannot readback
the fudge that ntpd applies, there is no easy way to tell the offset that
ntpd still has between system clock and message time.  So we check the
offset on our end, which does not include the ntpd fudge.

When this offset check is not made or is too broad, ntpd may lock to the
PPS clock without having correct time, and it will sync nicely on UTC
seconds interval but may be one or more seconds off.  This I consider
unacceptable.

ntpd has internal drivers for some GPS receivers and for PPS input, and
the algoritms behind that are similar (only using PPS after another source
has locked).

&gt;&gt;<i> This problem is specific to your use of NMEA.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NMEA is not a suitable protocol for this purpose, imho.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, wrong.  I'll bet $20 that when I get the garmin binary working that
</I>&gt;<i> the offset is similar to the same garmin in NMEA mode.
</I>
You seem to assume that binary mode is just a different way to package the
info that you already have in NMEA mode.  That is not true, at least not
for the binary modes I have investigated.
Binary modes (maybe better referred to as manufacturer-specific modes)
usually provide more information than NMEA, and when you are lucky there
are special messages that tell you the current time instead of a
time-of-fix.

&gt;<i> Either way I
</I>&gt;<i> need an offset different than yours.  Unless my garmin binary is 675mS
</I>&gt;<i> +/- 400mS the current code will fail.  That has zero to do with protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> The issue is probably the CPU time in the GPS to calculate the position,
</I>&gt;<i> not the time to output an NMEA sentence.
</I>
The main issue, as I explain for the last time now, is the way internal
tasks in the receiver operate asynchronously.  You have some task that
takes the correlator output and calculates a fix, that indeed takes some
time, and this fix is stored.  Another task checks what output you want in
what intervals, and it ships out messages.  Finally there is some output
ringbuffer that gets emptied by an interrupt handler.   Together those
activities delay the fix data, and whether this delay is constant depends
on how the tasks are synchronized.


&gt;&gt;<i> I have also seen others remark that they could not get really reliable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> results with NMEA, for example users of Jupiter receivers report that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes the delay jumps up or down by one second (suggesting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent processes of fix and serial output have slipped enough to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one result more or less in the pipeline).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We may, or may not, be able to solve the Jupiter, but a simple way to
</I>&gt;<i> change offset will solve my problem.
</I>
I find it strange that you care only about fixing your own problem and not
what problems others have, because before you entered the scene the
problem was already solved for someone else (not me, I do not use NMEA!),
and you start to pull things around anyway.

I think the quick solution to your problem is well known by now, you can
just change everything back to the way it was and modify the offset in
drivers.c locally, and then we can think about a solution that works for
more than one receiver.

&gt;&gt;<i> Check if they support some message that claims to report correct time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with  reference to PPS, instead of merely containing a timestamp of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measurement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do not have that from sentence, but as long as I can get it within a
</I>&gt;<i> second
</I>&gt;<i> it does not matter at all.
</I>
Apparently the Garmin protocol is not that great.
But when you implement it and put the 1-second offset there, there is no
need to change the value in drivers.c
