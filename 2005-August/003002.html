10 or 13 seconds?

SiRF mode to returns time referenced to GPS, not UTC. I'm not sure if
I got that from the docs or from one of the engineers, but I have it
from an authoritative source that the only places where you get UTC
out of a SiRF receiver are a) NMEA, b) message 52 (pps time) or c) by
hand, after decoding the 50bps data.

&gt;<i> A few observations:

</I>&gt;<i> I compiled gpsd with SiRF disabled, and that works great.
</I>&gt;<i> If I look at the data with cgps (which I like), the Climb, VPE, HPE, and

</I>
This is in the faq - perhaps I need to clarify that section.

Also, we might want to add a &quot;-buffered&quot; option to [cx]gps to allow
them to fill/update a structure and refresh the display of the
structure every measurement cycle, with the understanding that the use
of -buffered can lead to the display of outdated data.

&gt;<i> I was looking at sirf.c to find a way to blacklist my receiver (better than to
</I>&gt;<i> fully disable SiRF) but could not find any distinguishing message other than
</I>&gt;<i> 0x06. My version 231.000.000 (or close to that).
</I>
Ah, good ol'  231.000.000 ... what a festering pile of crap that was.

&gt;<i> Chris, is there a way to get a manufacturer or product string? Is there a
</I>&gt;<i> document online I should look at?
</I>
As best I can tell, SiRF-powered products aren't branded in firmware,
or at least not always meaningfully.

&quot;Note:&#173; Convert ASCII to symbol to assemble message (i.e., 0x4E is
`N'). This is a low priority task and is not necessarily outputted at
constant intervals. Effective with
version GSW 2.3.2, message length was increased from 21 to 81 bytes to
allow for upto 80-character version string.&quot;

Here's what Carl Carter has to say about firmware versions:

&gt;<i> I noticed that you send a request for a version message, but my mouse never
</I>&gt;<i> sends it to gpsd. I can get it from sirfmon.
</I>&gt;<i> Could the request message be bad?
</I>
Look for a nak message. Maybe the receiver is dropping the request due
to cpu exhaustion. Anyway, all my manuals say that a firmware version
request looks like this: A0A2 0002 8400 0084 B0B3


&gt;<i> Something a bit more esoteric:
</I>...
&gt;<i> The way I remember it, the data that goes into the array is put by the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler in a data segment in memory. When you get into the block, code is
</I>&gt;<i> executed that copies the data onto the stack to initialize your auto variable
</I>&gt;<i> msg.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the copy is unnecessary, and there is no need to use stack space.
</I>&gt;<i> Just make it  &quot;static unsigned char msg[] = {0xa0, 0xa2, 0x00, 0x09,&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since this is done all over, it should save quite a few cycles and stack
</I>&gt;<i> space.
</I>
Profile it and see how much it costs us - I'm betting not much. I
don't see a big issue with making it static though. But I'm not a
compiler jock...

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
