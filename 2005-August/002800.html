Then you probably have to factor in software rev, baud rate, which sentences
are enabled, CPU speed, and cross your fingers.  Anyone that knows ntpd
knows how to 'fudge' out the offset.  Giving a preset just leads a false
sense of security.

I agree here.  We gotta collect a lot of data before we see the shape of
any possible answer.

I backed out the 'precision' code I had added to ntpshm_put().  It did
nothing for my ntpd performance and was arguably misleading in most
cases.

You talked about adding sample offsets to timebase.h?  I do not see
any in there.  Is that where you want them?

We still need to agree on the answer to ntpshm_pps().  The simple answer
is to just allow PUT_MAX_OFFSET to stay at the new value of 500mS
instead of the old one of 400mS.  That works for me.

There was some confusion earlier.  There are 2 different xxx_MAX_OFFSET.

PUT_MAX_OFFSET is the difference between the system time stamp of the
GPS time arrival and the system time stamp of the PPS arrival.  That
delay is a fixed 420mS +/-10mS on my GPS-18/LVC.  When that fixed delay
is greate then PUT_MAX_OFFSET the PPS is ignored. 400mS is too toght for
me.

PPS_MAX_OFFSET is the difference between the system time and the PPS
time. PPS lock will not occur unless the PPS is within PPS_MAX_OFFSET
of system time.  PPS_MAX_OFFSET is 100mS and that value is 5x what I
need to pull in.  I do not want or need to change that.

So, the PPS lock will only happen if my 'fudge' value in ntp.conf
has been set to with 100mS of the PPS.

Another solution might be to dispense with PUT_MAX_OFFSET all together.
Now that I think of it, the PPS will always be within 500mS of the
NMEA/Binary time. :-)

Then leave it to the admin to be sure his system time is within 100mS of
correct and the PPS will pull it in the rest of the way.
