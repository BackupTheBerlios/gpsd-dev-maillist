<PRE>&gt;<i> Do you have any exerience with GPU that are native USB?  Not just with
</I>&gt;<i> an RS-232/USB chip glued in, but native USB?  I agree with you on the
</I>&gt;<i> RS-232 GPS, but my 7 months experience with the GPS-18/USB has been
</I>&gt;<i> excellent!  Running it almost full time and comparing it to network ntp
</I>&gt;<i> sources.
</I>
No, I don't have any receiver like that.
One would expect such a design to be more accurate.  But there are also
other factors, like the algorithm used in the receiver to ship the
collected data to the interface.  It looks like many receivers do not
directly reference the shipping of data to the derived GPS time, so you
often see a slowly slipping difference between reported time in messages
and the moment they are actually sent.
Apparently that GPS-18 receiver is better designed than average.

&gt;<i> Given that I have not seen any improvement in ntp by adding the precision
</I>&gt;<i> I have no problem takeing it back out, halfway.  How about we log
</I>&gt;<i> the precision, but do not ship it to ntpd?
</I>
It is possible, but ntpd can already log the offset, and the idea that
precision can be derived from the offset is IMHO only valid in the case of
system time being locked to PPS.
(and even there it is arguable)

&gt;&gt;<i> This is a losing battle.  I have 3 GPS receivers connected, one using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PPS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the other 3 message-based time, plus a DCF receiver (longwave), two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Internet timesources and a time peer at work that is also locked to DCF.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And *still* I see NTP make unwise decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well you are clearly on a higher plane than myself.  ntpd is keeping me
</I>&gt;<i> to within 10mS or better and that is all I need.
</I>
I'm not claiming my system is any good, it is just my test setup.
DCF receivers are $15 items here (they are much simpler than GPS) and the
GPS receivers are connected to test SiRF-I, Zodiac and TSIP when mods are
made to gpsd that sometimes break things.
At first I needed to plug things around but all the time I got request to
test things in Zodiac and TSIP alternately so I decided to just wire up
everything (using an antenna splitter).
I think I am going to disconnect my SiRF-I receiver soon, it has developed
problems that I think are firmware-related, and it is too old to find
updates for it.

&gt;&gt;<i> SHM(1) is the PPS clock, and the system is tightly locked to it.  All
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other sources are marked falseticker, even when they are off by as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as 0.25ms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Never seen anything like that, in setup or results.
</I>
Then you probably still have too much jitter.  When ntpd is locked within
1-2 us of PPS, this sometimes happens.
But usually sources that are within 5ms are marked 'candidate' and only
the message-based GPS sources (that are 10-100ms off) are marked
'falseticker'.
