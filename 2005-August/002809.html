Hey, it was broken, totally, in my case.  When I asked about a fix,
no one had one.  So I fixed it and asked your opinion at the same
time.  Now it is working for both of us and we are on to an even better
solution. That is what development builds are for.

&gt;<i> &gt; You talked about adding sample offsets to timebase.h?  I do not see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any in there.  Is that where you want them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This still has to be done.  I am not going to jump in and make changes
</I>&gt;<i> until  it is clear what we start from and where we head to, because I only
</I>&gt;<i> submit patches.
</I>
And that is why I also asked Eric what he wanted, it was his idea.

&gt;<i> Moving constants to timebase.h is a good idea, but it won't solve the
</I>&gt;<i> problem in your case.  For that, the extra functionality of a table of
</I>&gt;<i> receiver types and time offsets is required.
</I>
I was under the impression that he only wanted comments in that file
for now?  Got a better place to put a table of observations?

&gt;<i> For your own testing, you can modify the 0.675 in drivers.c until your
</I>&gt;<i> message time is in sync with your PPS time, or at least is well within
</I>&gt;<i> 400ms of it.
</I>
Now THAT is new info.  I had not noticed that.  That changes some things.

When, as just a test, I remove your 0.675 offset I see that my offset
is really 1.077 Sec.  Talk about being 1 Sec off.

&gt;<i> &gt; We still need to agree on the answer to ntpshm_pps().  The simple answer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is to just allow PUT_MAX_OFFSET to stay at the new value of 500mS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of the old one of 400mS.  That works for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that is only stable because you have other references and you put in a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably correct fudge in ntp.conf.
</I>
And yours is stable only because you put in a reasonable, for your
setup, fudge in the code.  It all comes down to where you want the fudge
factor, not if you have a fudge factor.  If we can determine it
automagically then good, but we do not know how to do that yet.

&gt;<i> A user that plugs in an unknown receiver and just starts everything in
</I>&gt;<i> default config will easily lock at 1 second off correct time.
</I>
Yes, that is what we are trying to solve.  Presently the old and new
code have that potential problem.

&gt;<i> We need to compensate for that somewhere, and we are now in the process of
</I>&gt;<i> finding how that can be done best so that it works for most people.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> &gt; PPS_MAX_OFFSET is the difference between the system time and the PPS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time. PPS lock will not occur unless the PPS is within PPS_MAX_OFFSET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of system time.  PPS_MAX_OFFSET is 100mS and that value is 5x what I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to pull in.  I do not want or need to change that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, the PPS lock will only happen if my 'fudge' value in ntp.conf
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has been set to with 100mS of the PPS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once the offset is compensated inside gpsd this setting of fudge in ntpd
</I>&gt;<i> is no longer required.  The option remains available for those that do not
</I>&gt;<i> want to modify gpsd and want to correct a small offset in their
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported receiver.
</I>
I doubt it is easier for the user to change the fudge in the code and
recompile than to change the fudge in the ntp.conf and restart ntpd.

If we can, and I doubt we can, figure out the fudge automatically, then
it belongs in our code.  If we can not IMHO the fudge belongs where the
the ntpd admin expects it.  That respects the principle of least surprise.

&gt;<i> &gt; Another solution might be to dispense with PUT_MAX_OFFSET all together.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now that I think of it, the PPS will always be within 500mS of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NMEA/Binary time. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then leave it to the admin to be sure his system time is within 100mS of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct and the PPS will pull it in the rest of the way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i> When we offer the service of synchronizing the system clock via gpsd, we
</I>&gt;<i> cannot expect it to be within 100ms via another method.
</I>
Just trying to cover all the possible solutions.  Until we have a working
solution we need to look at all the possibilities.  Nothing so far is
even close to 500mS.

&gt;<i> So, we need to apply some fudge factor to bring all known GPS receivers to
</I>&gt;<i> within a few hundred milliseconds of correct time (the 400 already was the
</I>&gt;<i> highest I wanted to go, other implementations of PPS locking recommend not
</I>&gt;<i> to go higher than 250).
</I>
Because of the ambiguity of which second, I do not see how the old solution
would prevent locking on the wrong second.  By your own admission some
GPS take 1.5 seconds to output the time.  Subtract your fudge of 0.675 and
we end up within the old 400mS window.  Viola, the old code locks on to
the wrong second.

&gt;<i> Then the PPS can be trusted to lock to the correct second.
</I>
Only if we get the right fudge factor all the time.  So far we have two
PPS data points and one non-PPS.  Here are the raw, unfudged, numbers:

PPS:
	Your GPS:    0.675
        GPS-18/LVC:  1.077 +/- 10mS

Non-PPS:
	GPS-18/USB:  0.725 +/- 20mS


The +/- 10mS is interesting, because at the moment time.windows.com is
17mS off from GPS, clepsydra and clock.isc.  Wanna guess who is right?
:<i>-)
</I>
&gt;<i> The best approach is not to use NMEA because the time information in there
</I>&gt;<i> is completely undefined, and probably only there to provide wall clock
</I>&gt;<i> time and some validation of the moment at which a fix was calculated.
</I>&gt;<i> Binary protocols sometimes have better-defined time messages, and also
</I>&gt;<i> they can often be run at higher serial rates.  This makes it all a bit
</I>&gt;<i> easier.
</I>
Well, in my case, when we settle this, I am going to try to get binary
protocol on the serial garmin.  Wanna bet the fudge factor is within 10%
of the NMEA one for the same device?  OTOH, I expect half the jitter.

Right now my system seems to be stable in the 1uS or better range w/ PPS.
Of course when I turn on the TV card it sags to 1mS again. :-)
