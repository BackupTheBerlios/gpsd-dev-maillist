I can see both sides to this.  On my serial GPS the 400mS offset is not
so good, just enough to get the right second for the PPS.  However, on
my native USB GPS, the offset is only 35mS and the long term accuracy is
about +/- 10mS.

I am trying to tweak the precision so that my ntpd makes better
decisions.  For some reason it still prefers a network based time to the
local GPS time even thought the accuracy and jitter of the local time is
3x better.  Somewhere around 4x ntp will start to prefer the local time.
I suspect the precision is involved.

So how do we cut this baby in half?  For the USB GPS this was a good
change, for the serial GPS it was not so good.

Jitter is not a good measure because the NMEA time will be accurate for
a bit, then make a jump of 100mS.

&gt;<i> Furthermore, the 400ms capture limit of PPS should not be increased too
</I>&gt;<i> much because of the risk of false lock.  If your messages would have been
</I>&gt;<i> 520 ms off the 500 ms limit would mean the PPS would lock you to the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> second.
</I>
Well, the capture limit is not really a capture limit.  My system clock
is already stable to +/-20mS with network and GPS ntp sources.  It is
really a capture limit plus a fixed offset.

The ntpshm_pps() seems to be comparing the PPS to the raw NMEA time, instead of
to a corrected time, or the sytem time, or ntpd time.

With the 420mS offset, which ntpshm_pps() has no way of knowing about,
the capture is only about 20mS wide.

&gt;<i> I think this change should be backed out.
</I>
So what do we replace it with?  I gotta get the PPS to work somehow.

Seems to me maybe we need to reference PPS capture time to the system time,
which is the best that ntpd can make it.  That makes my capture range less
than 100mS in most cases.

&gt;<i> &gt; With PPS the accuracy seems to be under 1mS on a busy workstation.  Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well under, hard to tell at that level.  Not bad for the price.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is the new part to the /etc/ntp.conf:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; # for NMEA and gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 127.127.28.0 minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 0.420 refid GPS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the proper way to compensate for your 420ms offset, not increasing
</I>&gt;<i> the capture range.
</I>
Apples and Oranges.  I had to do BOTH.  The fudge time is used by the
ntpd program, NOT by gpsd.  So with just the fudge, and not the 2nd
change, the PPS signal is in exactly the right place, but ntpshm_pps
still thinks it is 420mS off.

&gt;<i> What message protocol are you running?
</I>
NMEA 2.0 over serial.  Not sure is 2.3 would do this better since the
messages are longer.

For the USB GPS it is Garmin binary fixed length messages.  The fixed
length removes the sentence length jitter.

&gt;<i> Is there already a fixed offset in the code?
</I>
Nope.  ntpshm_pps() just looks at the raw offset between NMEA and PPS time.

&gt;<i> Some protocols have a fixed offset in the decoder to pre-compensate for
</I>&gt;<i> those offsets, maybe your protocol needs one too.
</I>
Well, nothing I can do in the Garmin GPS-18LVC.  SO how do we fix the
ntpshm_pps()?
