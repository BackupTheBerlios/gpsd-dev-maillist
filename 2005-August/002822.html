<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First I should say I am not very happy about the situation we are in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have written the NTP support for gpsd, and my only access to the SVN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by patches sent via Eric.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Suddenly I find an announcement here that someone has modified code to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adapt it to the needs of his own receiver, and I find myself in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> position where I have to defend each decision and have to beg to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes out of there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rob, I recall offering you svn access, specifically so you could
</I>&gt;<i> maintain the NTP code yourself, and having you turn it down.  That
</I>&gt;<i> offer is still open.
</I>
Maybe I did not express myself correctly.  I know that I could get SVN
access, but in this case that would have mattered little.  I would still
be in the position that the only thing I could to is to turn the changes
back and argue about why they are not good in my opinion.

I like to discuss any improvement and strategy to improve gpsd here, but
I don't like &quot;fixes to broken code&quot; to go in without even knowing that
anything was broken.  Maybe it was not broken, but merely not completely
understood.

(I wanted to type some more things about issues w.r.t. the version
management but I feel my English is not good enough to express what I feel
about it and I do not want to be misunderstood again)
