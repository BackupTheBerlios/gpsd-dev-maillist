I was very discouraged when I tried to make a laptop sync to it.  It
wasn't till many years later that somebody with much more patience
than I figured out the real secret.  Up to that point I too thought it
was just an NMEA task-delay issue and couldn't be fixed.

</I>
No, the handheld units don't have a documented pps pin.  I did open up
my first garmin gps (not that hard, the glue/melted plastic seal is
really crappy) and I probed around for a pps signal with a scope.  I
never did find one.

Surprisingly, the serial-only time from the units (once corrected for
their sawtooth clock slip) is quite good.  The problem is just that
garmin didn't document how to get the GPS's estimate of the clock skew
out of their gps's and that information hasn't been reverse engineered
for too many different units.  The GPS's of course know their own
clock skew to much better than 2 seconds or else they wouldn't be able
to calculate their position to less than a lunar-radius.
