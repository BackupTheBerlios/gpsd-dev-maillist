<PRE>OK, so gpxlogger.pl is now clearly superior to the C version.
Would somebody please translate it to Python so we can put it 
in the main directory without adding yet another runtime 
dependency to the project?

Is the PPS code working now?  Can I remove this item

    *** PPS code is flaky, possibly due to a pthreads bug

    Some code attempting to terminate the PPS-monitoring thread when there
    is no DCD (e.g., on a USB device) seems to have tickled some kind of
    bug in pthreads -- termination seems to close the GPS device or
    otherwise do something nasty to the serial I/O layer.  

    The default build has ENABLE_PPS off until we figure this one out.

from the TODO list?

Chris -- *very* nice cleanup job on the website pages!  It's really
good that somebody much less familiar with the material than me went
over them; you saw problems and possibilities that I missed.

If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of legislation
should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of
criminal acts reduced by such legislation. That they cannot do so
after a century and a half of trying -- that they must sweep under the
rug the southern attempts at gun control in the 1870-1910 period, the
northeastern attempts in the 1920-1939 period, the attempts at both
Federal and State levels in 1965-1976 -- establishes the repeated,
complete and inevitable failure of gun laws to control serious crime.
        -- Senator Orrin Hatch, in a 1982 Senate Report
