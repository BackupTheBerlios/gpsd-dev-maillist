I really should do that as a &quot;MyFirstPython(tm)&quot; exercise. The thing
is, that on many systems where I work, python is an extra runtime
dependency and perl is already there in the base system. There is no
runtime dependency introduced: the script is completely standalone,
doesn't need any non-standard perl modules, and doesn't interfere with
the build of gpsd if perl isn't there. The script is completely
incidental to normal use of gpsd - think of it as a sample of how to
talk to gpsd that just happens to kick out a data format that others
find useful.

Point of interest for those worried about me saying &quot;sleep(1)&quot; and
maybe sleeping a bit too long: it's nigh-impossible to get SiRF
receivers to output solutions (even in binary mode) faster than 1Hz.
At least with very aggressive polling I wasn't able to get solutions
out any faster. I have a few things to try yet, but I think I'm
running into a firmware limitation. SS2e (and e/LP) hardware may
capable of 5Hz solutions - the marketing bumph says that over 90% of
the cpu is available for user tasks, which implies that if the
firmware would let us, we could run solutions a lot more frequently.

&gt;<i> Chris -- *very* nice cleanup job on the website pages!  It's really

I would've pushed the updates myself but it appears you're the only
one with write access to the web directory. I should probably spend
another day with google et al. and find as many links to chipsets, dev
kits, protocol manuals, etc. Some days I feel lucky and get it too,
others... not so much.

&gt;<i> If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of legislation

</I>&gt;<i> criminal acts reduced by such legislation....
</I>
And it's people like you who're gonna cause some nut to bring about
sword control laws. ;) It's good to have ya back.
