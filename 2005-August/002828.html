Anything that gets caught in 24 hourse, much less before a release is
prety good.  Given some of the previous gpsd releases this is great. :-)

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Moving constants to timebase.h is a good idea, but it won't solve the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; problem in your case.  For that, the extra functionality of a table of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; receiver types and time offsets is required.

&gt;<i> Well that table certainly does not belong there.
</I>
OK, pick a place.  I really do not care where it is.  If it can be
automatic then great, if it has to be manual, then that is OK.  You
choose.

&gt;<i> &gt; I doubt it is easier for the user to change the fudge in the code and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recompile than to change the fudge in the ntp.conf and restart ntpd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't agree with that.   Large userbases of Linux systems download
</I>&gt;<i> or purchase binary distributions and never compile from source.  They
</I>&gt;<i> can edit a configuration file (maybe via some GUI), but they do not edit
</I>&gt;<i> and compile source.
</I>
Huh?  We both said the same thing. -&gt;  Putting the constant in the code
is the wrong thing. &lt;-  So where else will you accept putting it?

&gt;<i> The fudge between a message time and reasonably correct real time can
</I>&gt;<i> be handled this way, but not between message time and PPS time, because
</I>&gt;<i> NTP does not see this information and we cannot readback the fudge values
</I>&gt;<i> from NTP via the shm structure.
</I>
Who needs the fudge after the ntpd has the correct time?  Either the
PPS lines up on the 'true' time unit, or it does not.

&gt;<i> Looking at the system time instead of the message time is not a good idea
</I>&gt;<i> as I have explained before.
</I>
Well, try it again, because I missed that part.  All the message time is
for is to get us to the proper second.

&gt;<i> &gt; Just trying to cover all the possible solutions.  Until we have a working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution we need to look at all the possibilities.  Nothing so far is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even close to 500mS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This problem is specific to your use of NMEA.
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA is not a suitable protocol for this purpose, imho.
</I>
Ah, wrong.  I'll bet $20 that when I get the garmin binary working that
the offset is similar to the same garmin in NMEA mode.  Either way I
need an offset different than yours.  Unless my garmin binary is 675mS
+/- 400mS the current code will fail.  That has zero to do with protocol.
The issue is probably the CPU time in the GPS to calculate the position,
not the time to output an NMEA sentence.  The NMEA and garmin binary
contain approximatelyl the same data and are approximately the same
length.  Jitter will be better because the binary is fixed length, but
the PPS will fix that in either case.

&gt;<i> &gt; Because of the ambiguity of which second, I do not see how the old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would prevent locking on the wrong second.  By your own admission some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GPS take 1.5 seconds to output the time.  Subtract your fudge of 0.675 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we end up within the old 400mS window.  Viola, the old code locks on to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the wrong second.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before I implemented time support in gpsd, I wrote software to handle
</I>&gt;<i> this standalone, and I studied the matter.  I decided that I needed to
</I>&gt;<i> use binary protcol.  Even then, it usually wanders,
</I>
My wander is +/- 20mS.  More than adequate to locate the PPS on the proper
second.  Then the PPS pulls it in to 1uS.  I love that.  Been working
2 days solid.  All I had to do is change the fudge.

&gt;<i> but remains within
</I>      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;<i> usable tolerances to use PPS to lock to the correct second.
</I>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Agreed.  What else is there to say??

&gt;<i> I have also seen others remark that they could not get really reliable
</I>&gt;<i> results with NMEA, for example users of Jupiter receivers report that
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes the delay jumps up or down by one second (suggesting the
</I>&gt;<i> independent processes of fix and serial output have slipped enough to have
</I>&gt;<i> one result more or less in the pipeline).
</I>
We may, or may not, be able to solve the Jupiter, but a simple way to
change offset will solve my problem.

&gt;<i> &gt; Well, in my case, when we settle this, I am going to try to get binary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol on the serial garmin.  Wanna bet the fudge factor is within 10%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the NMEA one for the same device?  OTOH, I expect half the jitter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It depends on whether the Garmin binary protocol is any good.
</I>
I have been running the Garmin binary protocol over USB packets, instead
of over serial streams.  Just that, w/o PPS, give me +/- 10mS.  That seems
pretty good.

&gt;<i> Check if they support some message that claims to report correct time,
</I>&gt;<i> with  reference to PPS, instead of merely containing a timestamp of
</I>&gt;<i> measurement.
</I>
Do not have that from sentence, but as long as I can get it within a second
it does not matter at all.  If you do have it from a sentence, then you
should use your dynamic value to over-ride a manual value for me.

Let's stop arguing over whether this works or not.  My setup works great
for me.  Yours works great for you.  The only difference between us is
the value of the fudge.  One lousy code constant.

All I need is an adjustable fudge, manual or automatic, then we are both
happy.  Put it anywhere you want in the time path: ntpd; gpsd; config
file; code, etc. and my $70 unit will give not only me, but everyone, a
great time base.
