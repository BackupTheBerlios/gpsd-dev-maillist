<PRE>A while ago I found this problem:

&gt;<i> When gpsd is running and I start a backup of my system, which starts and
</I>&gt;<i> mounts a normally idle disk and does a tar cvzf to it, the load of the
</I>&gt;<i> system is quite high and gpsd seems to get out of sync with the received
</I>&gt;<i> data from the SiRF receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> It then gets stuck in a tight loop.  As gpsd is running at nice --10, this
</I>&gt;<i> further increases the load and slows down the backup to a crawl.
</I>&gt;<i> Killing gpsd makes the backup finish and then it can be started again.
</I>
I have tested it again.   I have bought &quot;some extra diskspace&quot; and have
moved around about 600GB of data to re-arrange the disk usage.
Although my system sometimes slowed down very much due to the buffer
overuse problem in the kernel (which seems to be ReiserFS-related), this
time gpsd has not caused any problem at all.  It has remained running well
and timesync was OK.

I should mention that before doing this experiment I have retired my SiRF
receiver (only have Trimble and Rockwell connected now) so if it only
happens with SiRF the test does not tell much.   I think, however, that it
has been solved by the recent architecture changes in gpsd.
