<PRE>First I should say I am not very happy about the situation we are in.
I have written the NTP support for gpsd, and my only access to the SVN is
by patches sent via Eric.
Suddenly I find an announcement here that someone has modified code to
adapt it to the needs of his own receiver, and I find myself in the
position where I have to defend each decision and have to beg to get
changes out of there.

I would have appreciated it if a possible problem was just posted here on
the list and discussed as usual, and then a solution could be found that
satisfies everyone.  When each change is just committed and later
announced, hopefully to be picked up by other maintainers, we are much
more likely to run into quality control problems.


&gt;<i> You talked about adding sample offsets to timebase.h?  I do not see
</I>&gt;<i> any in there.  Is that where you want them?
</I>
This still has to be done.  I am not going to jump in and make changes
until  it is clear what we start from and where we head to, because I only
submit patches.
Moving constants to timebase.h is a good idea, but it won't solve the
problem in your case.  For that, the extra functionality of a table of
receiver types and time offsets is required.
For your own testing, you can modify the 0.675 in drivers.c until your
message time is in sync with your PPS time, or at least is well within
400ms of it.

&gt;<i> We still need to agree on the answer to ntpshm_pps().  The simple answer
</I>&gt;<i> is to just allow PUT_MAX_OFFSET to stay at the new value of 500mS
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the old one of 400mS.  That works for me.
</I>
But that is only stable because you have other references and you put in a
reasonably correct fudge in ntp.conf.
A user that plugs in an unknown receiver and just starts everything in
default config will easily lock at 1 second off correct time.

&gt;<i> There was some confusion earlier.  There are 2 different xxx_MAX_OFFSET.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PUT_MAX_OFFSET is the difference between the system time stamp of the
</I>&gt;<i> GPS time arrival and the system time stamp of the PPS arrival.  That
</I>&gt;<i> delay is a fixed 420mS +/-10mS on my GPS-18/LVC.  When that fixed delay
</I>&gt;<i> is greate then PUT_MAX_OFFSET the PPS is ignored. 400mS is too toght for
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
That is because the time reported by your receiver is so far off.
But that is very usual in GPS receivers.  The time they report is often up
to 1.5 seconds before the moment they actually report it.  It occurs
because there are two processes running in the receiver, one that collects
data from the satellites and calculates position and time once every
second, and another that ships out those stored values over a slow serial
line.  So you get stale data and it gets enqueued for some time as well.

We need to compensate for that somewhere, and we are now in the process of
finding how that can be done best so that it works for most people.

&gt;<i> PPS_MAX_OFFSET is the difference between the system time and the PPS
</I>&gt;<i> time. PPS lock will not occur unless the PPS is within PPS_MAX_OFFSET
</I>&gt;<i> of system time.  PPS_MAX_OFFSET is 100mS and that value is 5x what I
</I>&gt;<i> need to pull in.  I do not want or need to change that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, the PPS lock will only happen if my 'fudge' value in ntp.conf
</I>&gt;<i> has been set to with 100mS of the PPS.
</I>
Once the offset is compensated inside gpsd this setting of fudge in ntpd
is no longer required.  The option remains available for those that do not
want to modify gpsd and want to correct a small offset in their
unsupported receiver.


&gt;<i> Another solution might be to dispense with PUT_MAX_OFFSET all together.
</I>&gt;<i> Now that I think of it, the PPS will always be within 500mS of the
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA/Binary time. :-)
</I>
&gt;<i> Then leave it to the admin to be sure his system time is within 100mS of
</I>&gt;<i> correct and the PPS will pull it in the rest of the way.
</I>
This is not reasonable.
When we offer the service of synchronizing the system clock via gpsd, we
cannot expect it to be within 100ms via another method.

The problem with PPS is that you get exact information about the start of
a second, but not *which* second.  Because of the unfortunate design of
GPS receivers we cannot easily get time information that is reliably
pointing to  the nearest second so that PPS can pull it to there.   That
is a fact that you have found as well.
So, we need to apply some fudge factor to bring all known GPS receivers to
within a few hundred milliseconds of correct time (the 400 already was the
highest I wanted to go, other implementations of PPS locking recommend not
to go higher than 250).
Then the PPS can be trusted to lock to the correct second.

The best approach is not to use NMEA because the time information in there
is completely undefined, and probably only there to provide wall clock
time and some validation of the moment at which a fix was calculated.
Binary protocols sometimes have better-defined time messages, and also
they can often be run at higher serial rates.  This makes it all a bit
easier.
