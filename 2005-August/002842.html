Yo Rob!

Note:  Curts has a fix to the new serial driver.  That fixes the GPGSV
problems with the garmin, bluetooth and likely other GPS.  With that
patch the fudge I need has changed to a much more reasonable 120 mS.

SVN is for trying things out.  I refuse to worry about all the times
Eric, or anyone else breaks my code, as long as we get it right for
each release.

&gt;<i> &gt; OK, pick a place.  I really do not care where it is.  If it can be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the value has to be in one of the dynamic datastructures.
</I>
I agree.  If several GPS are hooked up, they likely will need different
fudges, assuming zero is not acceptable to all.

&gt;<i> But I am not jumping to a solution yet as I realize that there may be two
</I>&gt;<i> different offsets we want to set for a binary protocol: one for the
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp info that is available in all protocols, and one for the
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated PPS message that is available in some protocols but usually not
</I>&gt;<i> in all versions of it.
</I>
Never seen the dedicated PPS thing.  All yours.

My guess is that the offset is not related much to protocol, but to
model number.  We have learned over and over again that saying NMEA is
little guarantee of anything.  Even in the Garmin line I expect the
CPU used vary in speed and therefore the fudge.

If we can come up for a fudge per model that might work, with a default.

&gt;<i> &gt; Who needs the fudge after the ntpd has the correct time?  Either the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PPS lines up on the 'true' time unit, or it does not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You keep missing the chicken-and-egg issue that you have when trying to
</I>&gt;<i> sync to PPS when not yet being locked to some absolute time info.  You
</I>&gt;<i> cannot make PPS lock onto true time unless you know what that is, and when
</I>&gt;<i> only an unknown NMEA GPS receiver is connected you don't know that.  And
</I>&gt;<i> when you are not locked you cannot know the offset of message time
</I>&gt;<i> relative to PPS.
</I>
First of all, please get off the &quot;NMEA is bad&quot; kick.  It may be, but the
problem is way more generic than that.  I am doing garmin binary as well
as NMEA and that has exactly the same issue and similar jitter.

I used to work for a company that made Calibration lab equipment.  They
got bought out by Phillips, you have heard of Phillips?  I very much
appreciate the Chicken/Egg aspects of metrology.  There are really
very, very, few absolute constants.  The few that do exist are so hard
to measure that we always have to leave it up to others to hold the
standard to which we agree on.

Before you place faith in any precision instrument you compare it to
another precision instrument and then either calculate a calibration
factor, or you assume the worst case measurement is good enough for your
purposes.

If all someone needs is a second or two accuracy, then the basic gps
serial time is much more than sufficient.  The digital clocks at my kids
school wander +/- 5minutes.  They would love this accuracy.  When my
brother wants to practice with his sextant in the middle of the Atlantic
he would kill for +/- 1Sec accuracy.

If someone needs a stable clock (say 1uS jitter) yet absolute accuracy
(+/- 1 Sec) is not critical, then PPS with gps serial is more than
adequate.

If someone really needs a 1uS accuracy, then he is not the average Joe
and can afford the one time calibration of the PPS to GPS serial time
and then save the fudge for all time.  Given the reports we constantly
get of GPS that compute the GPS/UTC time offset wrong it is clear folks
know how to do that.

&gt;<i> The only reasonable way to make ntpd lock to correct time, is to first let
</I>&gt;<i> it lock to an absolute source (the message time), and when it is within a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable difference of that source let it then lock to PPS.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> done in ntpshm.c by withholding PPS info to ntpd until ntpd has set the
</I>&gt;<i> system time to within 400ms of the received PPS.
</I>
Does not seem to me there is a way to avoid this problem without knowing
the fudge in advance.  My lowest fudge is 0.050mS.  Your largest is 1.5
S.  Without knowing the proper fudge how can the current code tell the
difference between an arbitrary GPS with a fudge of 0.050 S one one of
1.050 S?  My new GPS has a fudge of 0.120 S.  How does it tell that from a
fudge of 1.120 S?

We have three ways of knowing the fudge:
	The user can calculate it himself using ntpd and another time source.
	The GPS can provide it, as yours does.
	gpsd can supply a table, in code or documentation, of known values.

One thing I can do is to set a fudge of zero in just the garmin NMEA.
The garmin binary would be left at zero.  The only samples of garmin we
have would then easily pull in with a 400mS PUT_MAX_OFFSET.  Other NMEA,
other binary, and yours would be untouched for now.

When someone steps forward with a GPS that needs a non-zero fudge we acn
try to jam it in a driver for that GPS.

&gt;<i> As you cannot readback
</I>&gt;<i> the fudge that ntpd applies, there is no easy way to tell the offset that
</I>&gt;<i> ntpd still has between system clock and message time.  So we check the
</I>&gt;<i> offset on our end, which does not include the ntpd fudge.
</I>
Chicken and Egg again.  ntpd only applies a fudge that we ask it to.

If the ntp fudge is the right one, then who cares?  The PPS lines up
just right and we accept it as valid.  If the ntp fudge lines up wrong,
then the user shot himself in the foot and the fix is in his ntp.conf,
not the gpsd code.

&gt;<i> When this offset check is not made or is too broad, ntpd may lock to the
</I>&gt;<i> PPS clock without having correct time, and it will sync nicely on UTC
</I>&gt;<i> seconds interval but may be one or more seconds off.  This I consider
</I>&gt;<i> unacceptable.
</I>
I agree that is unacceptable.  Otherwise I would not care about PPS.  I
do not agree that your solution prevents it.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This problem is specific to your use of NMEA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; NMEA is not a suitable protocol for this purpose, imho.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ah, wrong.  I'll bet $20 that when I get the garmin binary working that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the offset is similar to the same garmin in NMEA mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You seem to assume that binary mode is just a different way to package the
</I>&gt;<i> info that you already have in NMEA mode.  That is not true, at least not
</I>&gt;<i> for the binary modes I have investigated.
</I>
Well, I refer you to the Garmin docs then:

<A HREF="http://www.garmin.com/support/commProtocol.html">http://www.garmin.com/support/commProtocol.html</A>

The NMEA data and the Garmin data are virtually identical.  The changes
can be summarized as:
	fixed length vs. variable length
	one sentence for all PVT data vs. instead of spread over several
	once sentence for all SAT data vs. instead of spread over several
	binary data vs. ascis encoded data

&gt;<i> Binary modes (maybe better referred to as manufacturer-specific modes)
</I>&gt;<i> usually provide more information than NMEA, and when you are lucky there
</I>&gt;<i> are special messages that tell you the current time instead of a
</I>&gt;<i> time-of-fix.
</I>
Well, in this case my luck is bad.  OTOH, the garmin firmware is
approved for use in manned flight by numerous goverments at Mach 1.  So
I have a lot of trust that it does what I want well.  What I want is
just PVT.  The PPS gives me accuracy to 1uS and that is good enough for
me.

&gt;<i> &gt; Either way I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need an offset different than yours.  Unless my garmin binary is 675mS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +/- 400mS the current code will fail.  That has zero to do with protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The issue is probably the CPU time in the GPS to calculate the position,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not the time to output an NMEA sentence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main issue, as I explain for the last time now, is the way internal
</I>&gt;<i> tasks in the receiver operate asynchronously.
</I>
That would be jitter, not offset.  I have NO jitter problems, I have an
offset problem.  The offset from GPS sentence to PPS is very stable with
a LONG TERM value of (+/- 10mS).  My measured offset would be no problem
if the gpsd code was not adding a 675mS offset and then complaining
my offset from PPS is more than 400mS!

&gt;<i> You have some task that
</I>&gt;<i> takes the correlator output and calculates a fix, that indeed takes some
</I>&gt;<i> time, and this fix is stored.  Another task checks what output you want in
</I>&gt;<i> what intervals, and it ships out messages.  Finally there is some output
</I>&gt;<i> ringbuffer that gets emptied by an interrupt handler.   Together those
</I>&gt;<i> activities delay the fix data, and whether this delay is constant depends
</I>&gt;<i> on how the tasks are synchronized.
</I>
I have no doubt this is a problem in many GPS.   Just becasue some GPS
are sub-optimal does not mean we do not use the good ones.  8 months with
the GPS-18/USB proves to me it does not have the problem.  Not solving
some problems because you can not solve them all is not a good way to
approach this.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have also seen others remark that they could not get really reliable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; results with NMEA, for example users of Jupiter receivers report that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sometimes the delay jumps up or down by one second (suggesting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; independent processes of fix and serial output have slipped enough to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; one result more or less in the pipeline).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We may, or may not, be able to solve the Jupiter, but a simple way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change offset will solve my problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find it strange that you care only about fixing your own problem and not
</I>&gt;<i> what problems others have, because before you entered the scene the
</I>&gt;<i> problem was already solved for someone else (not me, I do not use NMEA!),
</I>&gt;<i> and you start to pull things around anyway.
</I>
Well then you misunderstand.  I certainly do not intend to break any
other GPS.  It is still experimentally unproven that changeing the lock
range from 400mS to 500mS has had a bad effect on anything in real life.
Nothing is released and this is just SVN HEAD.  So you can tone down the
drama a bit.  I consider fixing my case a stepping stone to fixing more
and more cases.

&gt;<i> I think the quick solution to your problem is well known by now, you can
</I>&gt;<i> just change everything back to the way it was and modify the offset in
</I>&gt;<i> drivers.c locally, and then we can think about a solution that works for
</I>&gt;<i> more than one receiver.
</I>
Well we KNOW that the simple drivers.c change you suggest WILL break things
for whoever wanted the 0.675 so let's pass on that idea.  We both want
a more general fix.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Check if they support some message that claims to report correct time,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with  reference to PPS, instead of merely containing a timestamp of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; measurement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do not have that from sentence, but as long as I can get it within a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; second
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it does not matter at all.
</I>
&gt;<i> Apparently the Garmin protocol is not that great.
</I>&gt;<i> But when you implement it and put the 1-second offset there, there is no
</I>&gt;<i> need to change the value in drivers.c
</I>
Except for all those people other than me that also want this to work
and do not have a Garmin.  Let's work on a general fix for everyone.

&gt;<i> &gt; Fine, have it your way, you pick.  Come up with a way that I get a fudge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of 1.077 and you have a fudge of 0.675.  We KNOW that those values work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very well for each of us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your choice, one or all of:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	ntpd.conf
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	gpsd.conf
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	environment var
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	sentence decoding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	#define
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	command line switch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	automagic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pick one.  I do not care.  (Eric might.)  The only thing NOT acceptable is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leaving in a magic number that only works for your favorite brand and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not for my favorite brand or someone else's favorite brand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with you that configuration is required, but that is a dead
</I>&gt;<i> end because Eric does not want it.
</I>
Please notice the ntpd.conf above.  That is a manual configuration that
must be done in any case before gpsd can be used with ntpd.conf.  Any reason
not to put it there?

&gt;<i> As automatic methods are no solution in this case, we need something like
</I>&gt;<i> a file or commandline arg.  ./configure parameter would be possible, but I
</I>&gt;<i> think it is worse.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that gpsd may drive more than one receiver so some simple
</I>&gt;<i> implementations may not really cut it.
</I>
I could live with a command line arg.  As we get experience we could learn
enough to make something automatic.  Not sure Eric would like that long
term either.  I am not happy about having the required addition to
ntp.conf AND another one somewhere else.  If the default was zero that
wold work for me.

We could also graft another variable in to the gps_type_t for the fudge
for that gps type.  Dunno about you, but I can figure out how to ID
the GPS that I can test for.  There are a lot of IDs in the code now.

That also solves the multiple GPS problems since the fudge is adjacent to
the rest of the specific GPS info.  The data in the structure can be
static for those that can be reliably dynamic.

&gt;<i> &gt; Pick something easy, and I'll code it if you want.  Otherwise send me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patches and I'll svn them in.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just two requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	I see fudge of 1.077, you see 0.675.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	We do it before Eric gets back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me re-iterate that I have not put the NMEA timesync in, and while I do
</I>&gt;<i> not remember if I put the 0.675 in on someone else's request or if someone
</I>&gt;<i> put it there, I certainly have no receiver that requires that value.
</I>
Well I do not care either, if we can put a model specific fudge in
gps_type_t.  For at least a while that gives us enough flexibility to
handle many GPS.  As we get more than the small data set we have we
can come up with improvements.

&gt;<i> If it helps you, you can put 0.8 or 1.0 there until we find a real
</I>&gt;<i> solution,
</I>
Well, now it looks like I only need a 0.120mS fudge.  Given  +/- 400mS
PUT_MAX_OFFSET any fudge from 0 to about 400mS works for me.

The garmin binary code has zero fudge and that works fine.  When I force
the Garmin NMEA to zero that works fine.

Give me a random fudge and it will work 80% of the time.  :-)

&gt;<i> or just declare that gpsd will not be able to timesync on NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> receivers.
</I>
Well maybe it doesn't work for you, but it works great for me, with the
PPS I am getting 0.002 mS jitter from ntpq!  Without PPS it is still
better than 5 mS.  That is better than I get from time.windows.com
over TCP/IP.  Just because some GPS are so crappy this does not work
perfectly does not mean we should not support the ones that do work.
