<PRE>&gt;<i> Question: why are we running at an elevated priority? That is dangerous.
</I>&gt;<i> Do we
</I>&gt;<i> really have to?
</I>
This improves the accuracy of time synchronisation, especially (but not
only) when PPS is used.

Normally, gpsd should be blocked waiting for input, and when it arrives it
should consume only a limited number of CPU cycles and go into a blocked
wait again.  Running such processes at high priority does not hurt.

However, when they go into a loop for some reason, the system could become
unresponsive (salesman's jargon for &quot;it could crash&quot;).

Fortunately, with Unix and only using nice(), it normally is not that
disastrous.  Unix's scheduler is clever enough to not completely starve
processes that have lower priority (mainly because nice() only sets a
starting level for a dynamically calculated priority that lowers when a
process eats CPU time).

But once realtime settings like &quot;run to completion&quot; are made, it could
really crash the system.
This is not really required, unless you want to tweak the most out of PPS
accuracy (and don't want to patch the kernel with PPSAPI support).

&gt;<i> As to the select() -&gt; read() -&gt; EINTR | EAGAIN:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have spent a long time researching this five years back. The result was
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> you can safely ignore EINTR and EAGAIN in this setup. You can simply enter
</I>&gt;<i> select() again and it will return the same fd as ready again. No harm
</I>&gt;<i> done.
</I>
I agree, it should work OK.  At least as long as you remember to set the
bitmasks and timeout value before each select call :-)
(a mistake sometimes made that can result in select() spins)
