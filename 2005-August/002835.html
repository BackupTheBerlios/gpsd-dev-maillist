<PRE>&gt;<i> Surprisingly, the serial-only time from the units (once corrected for
</I>&gt;<i> their sawtooth clock slip) is quite good.  The problem is just that
</I>&gt;<i> garmin didn't document how to get the GPS's estimate of the clock skew
</I>&gt;<i> out of their gps's and that information hasn't been reverse engineered
</I>&gt;<i> for too many different units.  The GPS's of course know their own
</I>&gt;<i> clock skew to much better than 2 seconds or else they wouldn't be able
</I>&gt;<i> to calculate their position to less than a lunar-radius.

The receiver does not need to keep time to find a solution when it has
enough channels.  Very early receivers hopped between satellites and
needed a very stable clock to make consequtive measurements that could
later be related to eachother, but a receiver less than 5 years old just
has 12 channels and measures them all in parallel.  With 4 or more
satellites in view a position plus time can be calculated from that.

In other receiver's documentation one can read that the clock is kept with
a millisecond and reset when it deviates more, and that also clearly does
not mean that the accuracy of position is similar to 1ms of light travel.

I still think the main problem is that timestamps in messages are not an
indication of current time, but are time-of-fix.  Yet it is attempted to
treat them as current time.
Because GPS receivers run multitasking kernels, and the different
processes often are not tightly locked to another, you can see slipping
delays between generation of data and shipping it to the serial port.  Add
to that the queueing and transmission delays over a slow serial port and
you get the situation that the data received in the PC can be over one
second old even when there is no more than a single stored position that
is calculated and shipped every second.
