<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The precision is set for message-based time.  In my experience this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is bad.  Precision is not better than the order of .5 second for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message-based time, it should only be set for PPS time where we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assurance of accuracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see both sides to this.  On my serial GPS the 400mS offset is not
</I>&gt;<i> so good, just enough to get the right second for the PPS.  However, on
</I>&gt;<i> my native USB GPS, the offset is only 35mS and the long term accuracy is
</I>&gt;<i> about +/- 10mS.
</I>
Sometimes the precision can be good, but in my experience it is often
wobbly and wanders around over at least 250ms on most receivers.
This does not warrant a precision of better than .5 second even when short
time jitter is low.


&gt;<i> I am trying to tweak the precision so that my ntpd makes better
</I>&gt;<i> decisions.  For some reason it still prefers a network based time to the
</I>&gt;<i> local GPS time even thought the accuracy and jitter of the local time is
</I>&gt;<i> 3x better.  Somewhere around 4x ntp will start to prefer the local time.
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect the precision is involved.
</I>
This is a losing battle.  I have 3 GPS receivers connected, one using PPS
and the other 3 message-based time, plus a DCF receiver (longwave), two
Internet timesources and a time peer at work that is also locked to DCF.
And *still* I see NTP make unwise decisions.

About 15 minutes ago I had this state:

SHM(1) is the PPS clock, and the system is tightly locked to it.  All
other sources are marked falseticker, even when they are off by as little
as 0.25ms.

And now it suddenly has decided to go to:
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset 
jitter

The ntp log says:
 4 Aug 20:29:00 ntpd[6126]: synchronized to LOCAL(0), stratum 10
 4 Aug 20:30:49 ntpd[6126]: synchronized to SHM(1), stratum 0
 4 Aug 20:33:59 ntpd[6126]: synchronized to LOCAL(0), stratum 10
 4 Aug 20:35:02 ntpd[6126]: synchronized to SHM(1), stratum 0
 4 Aug 20:36:08 ntpd[6126]: synchronized to LOCAL(0), stratum 10
 4 Aug 20:36:30 ntpd[6126]: synchronized to SHM(1), stratum 0

I really don't understand why it suddenly locks to LOCAL with so many good
sources available...   This happens once every few hours, and then it
remains quiet again and locked to SHM(1).
I can only guess it is somehow caused by a misdecode on the DCF receiver
(see the high jitter figure there) which seems to upset the decision
algorithm even when the DCF source was already marked a falseticker before
that.

I don't think you can convince ntpd to lock to a source by telling it is
high precision.  When locked to PPS we have something like -16 on SHM(1),
the other SHMs are at -1, DCF is at -6 or so and still it flips away.

After I typed the above paragraph it has again stabilized:
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset 
jitter

You can see that the PPS precision is now a bit worse, and DCF is again
considered a candidate.   It will now again slowly lock to PPS.


&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, the 400ms capture limit of PPS should not be increased too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much because of the risk of false lock.  If your messages would have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 520 ms off the 500 ms limit would mean the PPS would lock you to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrong
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the capture limit is not really a capture limit.  My system clock
</I>&gt;<i> is already stable to +/-20mS with network and GPS ntp sources.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> really a capture limit plus a fixed offset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ntpshm_pps() seems to be comparing the PPS to the raw NMEA time,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of
</I>&gt;<i> to a corrected time, or the sytem time, or ntpd time.
</I>
The reason I do this, is that a system with only gpsd as a reference might
lock one-second-off when we would take the capture range relative to the
system clock.  It would first lock to the GPS, drifting towards the time
decoded from the messages, and when the time crosses a PPS pulse close to
correct time it would lock on to that, even when it is wrong.
When ntpd has no other references (like Internet) it has no way of knowing
about the problem and it will remain locked at the wrong time.

With the current code it at least will not lock at all.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is the proper way to compensate for your 420ms offset, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increasing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the capture range.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apples and Oranges.  I had to do BOTH.  The fudge time is used by the
</I>&gt;<i> ntpd program, NOT by gpsd.  So with just the fudge, and not the 2nd
</I>&gt;<i> change, the PPS signal is in exactly the right place, but ntpshm_pps
</I>&gt;<i> still thinks it is 420mS off.
</I>
You are right, I applied the method of compensating for small errors (like
100 ms) to your case, which is incorrect because of the abovementioned
logic.

The way to fix this is to add a fixed offset to the ntpshm_put value.
Right now, the code is full of empirically determined fixed offsets that
worked well because each protocol normally has only few implementations,
and  so a fixed offset will compensate for the delays particular to that
protocol.

But you use NMEA and there exist so many NMEA receivers that the fixed
0.675 second offset determined for one receiver is off by .42 seconds for
your receiver!
I think wat we need, at least in the case of NMEA, is some configuration
method to determine the value of this offset.
E.g., a lookup table inside the program.
(simpler would be a commandline option, but Eric would never allow that)

&gt;&gt;<i> What message protocol are you running?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA 2.0 over serial.  Not sure is 2.3 would do this better since the
</I>&gt;<i> messages are longer.
</I>
For reliable timekeeping you better avoid NMEA.
Doesn't this receiver support some binary protocol?


&gt;&gt;<i> Is there already a fixed offset in the code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nope.  ntpshm_pps() just looks at the raw offset between NMEA and PPS
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>
What I meant is the fixed offset when calling ntpshm_put, as described above.
