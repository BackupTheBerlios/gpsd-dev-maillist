<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The reason I do this, is that a system with only gpsd as a reference might
</I>&gt;<i> lock one-second-off when we would take the capture range relative to the
</I>&gt;<i> system clock.  It would first lock to the GPS, drifting towards the time
</I>&gt;<i> decoded from the messages, and when the time crosses a PPS pulse close to
</I>&gt;<i> correct time it would lock on to that, even when it is wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> When ntpd has no other references (like Internet) it has no way of knowing
</I>&gt;<i> about the problem and it will remain locked at the wrong time.
</I>
Would you please send a patch adding a comment to either ntpsh.c or
HACKING that explains this?  That is a complicated set of assumptions
and needs to be documented for the benefit of future maintainers.

&gt;<i> The way to fix this is to add a fixed offset to the ntpshm_put value.
</I>&gt;<i> Right now, the code is full of empirically determined fixed offsets that
</I>&gt;<i> worked well because each protocol normally has only few implementations,
</I>&gt;<i> and  so a fixed offset will compensate for the delays particular to that
</I>&gt;<i> protocol.
</I>
This should also be documented.  

There is a file called timebase.h that collects policy constants related 
to time.  I think I would like those &quot;empirically determined fixed offsets&quot;
to become #defines set in that file, with an explanation.

&gt;<i> But you use NMEA and there exist so many NMEA receivers that the fixed
</I>&gt;<i> 0.675 second offset determined for one receiver is off by .42 seconds for
</I>&gt;<i> your receiver!
</I>&gt;<i> I think wat we need, at least in the case of NMEA, is some configuration
</I>&gt;<i> method to determine the value of this offset.
</I>&gt;<i> E.g., a lookup table inside the program.
</I>&gt;<i> (simpler would be a commandline option, but Eric would never allow that)
</I>
That's not &quot;simpler&quot;, Rob!   More flexible, yes, but not simpler.

This fudge factor sounds like it wants to be a capability in the driver 
method table.
