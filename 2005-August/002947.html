</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I believe happens is that whenever gpsd gets a NMEA message, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'forwards' the data it got via socket in watcher mode or dbus. Is this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really how it's supposed to work? Shouldn't it wait for a complete
</I>&gt;<i> dataset? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be nice, but it's impossible.  The problem is that, handed an 
</I>&gt;<i> unknown NMEA device, you can't know which sentence is the last in the
</I>&gt;<i> cycle.  
</I>&gt;<i> Different devices send them in different orders.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very general problem, and actually one of the major reasons
</I>&gt;<i> we have binary-protocol support.  It cuts down on the number of watcher
</I>&gt;<i> events generated per cycle.
</I>
I was actually aware of that and put some thought into it, but it should be
confirmed by people with diffrent GPSes.
Observations for my receiver:
- Sentences are sent in a burst. I don't know if this is possible, but maybe
we could use timing to detect what a burst consists of as
- Bursts are consistant, ie ususally consist of the same sentences (in my
case vendor specifics sometimes intermingle, but as far as I saw only at the
end of a burst).
- Most NMEA sentences carry a timestamp, all common that carry a position
(and as such are likely to be sent first) do. Therefore, if the first
approach doesn't work, we could assume that whatever has the 'new' timestamp
is the first sentence of a burst.

gpsd could monitor a few bursts and decide what to do. I know that it's
probably not easy, but anything to improve the current situation would be
nice =)
We'd need to collect some examples of timestamped NMEA logs from diffrent
receivers and fix/no fix/no satellites in view situations to decide if a
logic for gpsd can be found.

Cheers
Tobias
