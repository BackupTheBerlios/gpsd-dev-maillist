<PRE>Rob,

I think you took care of the problem. I don't think this will be an ongoing 
problem. So, let's get on with life...

If, OTOH you feel that is not good enough, then tell us how you want to change 
the process.

Personally I think this group is small enough, so that we only occasionally 
stomp over each other.

I am with you on the commit policy. I also only submit patches here, and let 
Eric sort it out. Just covering my ass ;-)

Cheers,
Remco

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; position where I have to defend each decision and have to beg to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; changes out of there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rob, I recall offering you svn access, specifically so you could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintain the NTP code yourself, and having you turn it down.  That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; offer is still open.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I did not express myself correctly.  I know that I could get SVN
</I>&gt;<i> access, but in this case that would have mattered little.  I would still
</I>&gt;<i> be in the position that the only thing I could to is to turn the changes
</I>&gt;<i> back and argue about why they are not good in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like to discuss any improvement and strategy to improve gpsd here, but
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like &quot;fixes to broken code&quot; to go in without even knowing that
</I>&gt;<i> anything was broken.  Maybe it was not broken, but merely not completely
</I>&gt;<i> understood.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I wanted to type some more things about issues w.r.t. the version
</I>&gt;<i> management but I feel my English is not good enough to express what I feel
</I>&gt;<i> about it and I do not want to be misunderstood again)
