<PRE>&gt;<i> Some GPS's also seem to project the solution forward in time, I assume

This is called &quot;dead reckoning&quot; and it actually is considered a feature,
not a bug.
Properly implemented it does not project a fix in the future, but it
calculates a fix given previous fix and velocity vector, to use when there
is temporary loss of signal.
This would be useful in a car navigation application when you drive in
urban areas, under overpasses, etc.

Of course it should be mostly invisible when you have good signal from at
least 4 satellites.
