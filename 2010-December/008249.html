</I>
A ship or coast based MMSI must be 9 digits.  If you have an 8 digit number then it is probably 
missing the leading digit which is the geographical identity, which is one of the following:

     * 2 Europe
     * 3 North and Central America and Caribbean
     * 4 Asia
     * 5 Oceania
     * 6 Africa
     * 7 South America

It is an unfortunate regional practice in the USA for USA registered vessels travelling solely 
in US waters to omit the leading &quot;3&quot; from their MMSI.  This is apparently because the USA is 
the only country in the world.  However in that case you'd mostly get an 8 digit number of the 
form &quot;669xxxxx&quot;.  You can safely pretend that there's a leading &quot;3&quot; in those cases.

There is a special case which are seven digit MMSIs beginning with the digit &quot;1&quot; (no 9 digit 
MMSI begins with a 1, all MMSIs that begin with a 1 should be 7 digits).  They are Inmarsat A 
stations transmitting over FM.  I was under the understanding that they had all been 
discontinued in 2007, but I may be mistaken.  It's also my understanding that they transmitted 
on a band that most AIS receivers wouldn't detect, however someone may have hacked one to 
transmit on the normal AIS band, and/or I may be mistaken.

&gt;<i> I find the &#8220;aivdm_decode&#8221; function from driver_aivdm.cpp of GPSD

</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;!AIVDM,1,1,,A,10:OHh?P008;&lt;TlAOjT4Jgv:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">0 at 2p</A>,0*4D&#8221; comes a result:
</I>&gt;<i> MMSI=11000000, a 8-digit number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t know whether it is a problem, if it is, what&#8217;s wrong with it and

</I>
I think it's bogus.  &quot;1100000&quot; as a 7 digit MMSI would have been a valid Inmarsat A terrestrial 
or satellite service prior to 2007.  If it's a satellite service then I'd like to know what it 
reported as lat/long/speed.  In any case I'd like to know what it reported as position and 
vector because no terrestrial Inmarsat A service ever transmitted over AIS as far as I'm aware. 
  It could be that there's something bogus floating around out there that's incorrectly 
transmitting an obsolete 7 digit Inmarsat A MMSI with a bogus zero appended to the end, and if 
that's the case then the appropriate maritime authorities should be notified.
