<PRE><A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">f4eru at free.fr</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">f4eru at free.fr</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> This may be of interest to this list
</I>
It certainly is, yes.  Apologies for the delay in responding; I had been busy
with other projects for a while, and while my lieutenants are very capable
you've raised the sort of issue they (rightly, most of the time) tend to 
leave to me.
 
&gt;<i> I recently used a GPS module as a time and date reference in an
</I>&gt;<i> embedded project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As GPS has a Y2K style bug, the week counter rollover, which happens
</I>&gt;<i> every 1024 weeks (roughly 20 years), i tried the receiver i use with
</I>&gt;<i> a test generator capable of sending a GPS signal with a random
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp.
</I>
Excellent.  That capability alone is enough to make me want you on our devteam;
we don't have anyone else who can do this.

&gt;<i> And guess what, my module handles this wrongly, and jumps back to
</I>&gt;<i>  1999 if a cold boot is done after April 6, 2019
</I>
I fail to be in the least surprised by yet another report of crappy firmware
that breaks on edge cases. I'm gathering you weren't either.

&gt;<i> several issues with that :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - the date is invalid, obviously
</I>&gt;<i> - UTC time is correct, but a local time calculated on this will sometimes be off +- 1hr, due to wrong DST calculation
</I>&gt;<i> - some receivers may not get a position (mine was fixing correctly)
</I>
Right, it will be able to recover from this glitch if it thinks it has
a reasonably current ephemeris.  If you were to leave it powered off
for a week and then try this experiment, you'd probably find it didn't
get a fix.

&gt;<i> - Finally, gpsd (and other SW probably) interprets the date &quot;99&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i>   GPRMC as 2099, which gives a 32bit overflow in unix time, gpsmon
</I>&gt;<i>   reports an error &quot;negative date&quot; and a date in 1969 (probably a -1
</I>&gt;<i>   returned from the unix time lib), if i enable the GPZDA frame on
</I>&gt;<i>   the Rx, it reports &quot;correctly&quot; 1999. A 64 bit system will probably
</I>&gt;<i>   report 2099
</I>
Right again, we're likely to see similar issues with any date after the
32-bit time_t rollover point in 2038.

&gt;<i> Some suggestions :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - correcting the GPRMC date detection to 20xx except 1999 for &quot;99&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   would perhaps be a good thing to do. At least gpsd will be
</I>&gt;<i>   synchron to the GPS info, and no averflow will happen on 32 bit
</I>&gt;<i>   time_t systems. Of course we loose one year before the 2100 bug,
</I>&gt;<i>   but fair enough, that's an order of magnitude away from now than
</I>&gt;<i>   2019
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - trying to compensate the 20 year error can be dangerous coz based
</I>&gt;<i>   on the machine time which can be corrupt also, and, for some
</I>&gt;<i>   applications,will later be based on GPS, etc... but it's feasible
</I>&gt;<i>   if the detection is based on a proper window (ex : machine_utc -
</I>&gt;<i>   gps_utc = n*1024 weeks +- 1 month). The non-trivial part is
</I>&gt;<i>   calculating offsets of exactly n*1024 weeks in UTC in seconds...
</I>
I agree with those suggestions.  I'd prefer you to implement them - I'd
certainly be willing to put in the coding effort, but since I can't
actually test the live edge cases the way you can it would be more 
efficient for you to do it.  

If you have C coding skills that is; if you don't, I'll do what I
can based on the data logs you pointed us at.

&gt;<i> - maintaining a list of tested devices and bad guys. Crappy GPS
</I>&gt;<i>   chipsets exist, and will probaqbly still be in production in 2019
</I>&gt;<i>   (and many systems in use will fail due to crappy design). People
</I>&gt;<i>   need to test devices with test transmitters. I volunteer.
</I>
Accepted with gratitude.  Here's how to get started:

1. Get a site membership at Berlios.  

2. Apply to join the GPSD project as a dev.  I'll check you in.

3. git pull the repository as a dev.

4. Look at gpscap.ini.  This is the master capability database from 
which we generate <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html</A> ; you'll
be editing this to create craplist entries. You can hack it directly
or go through the web form at <A HREF="https://www.mainframe.cx/cgi-bin/gps_report.cgi">https://www.mainframe.cx/cgi-bin/gps_report.cgi</A>

5. Become familiar with the way the regression-test suite works.
The relevant tools are gpsfake and the regression-test script 
harness, regress_driver.

I look forward to your followup.
