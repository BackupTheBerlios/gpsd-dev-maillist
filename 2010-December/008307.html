<PRE>Dave Platt &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">dplatt at radagast.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> By adding debug printouts I think I've pinned down the cause
</I>&gt;<i> of the problem, to a code change made a couple of days ago
</I>&gt;<i> to libgpsd_core.c:  cf0546b12c91cb0121a4a643e0c4eef8a27e6997
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be the culprit.
</I>
My doing.  I'll explain below.
 
&gt;<i> This change had the effect of completely eliminating the
</I>&gt;<i> following lines:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #ifdef HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H
</I>&gt;<i> #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> #endif /* HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H */
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, the TIOCMIWAIT symbol is never defined,
</I>&gt;<i> and all of the code which is conditionally compiled
</I>&gt;<i> based on the presence of this symbol simply doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> get built... the init_kernel_pps and gpsd_ppsmonitor
</I>&gt;<i> functions are gone, and the PPS-monitoring thread is not
</I>&gt;<i> started.
</I>
Well spotted.  I've just pushed a commit that should solve this problem.
It includes &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt; if (and only if) PPS_ENABLE is defined.
 
&gt;<i> It looks as if the HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H flag is no longer
</I>&gt;<i> being determined by the configuration script... so just
</I>&gt;<i> putting these three lines back into libgpsd_core.c doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> fix the problem.  Always including &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt; does fix
</I>&gt;<i> it for me, but I suspect that this might break compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> on some other systems.
</I>
OK, here's what happened.

Some week ago I wrote a tool called deheader (learn more at 
<A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/deheader/">http://www.catb.org/~esr/deheader/</A>) that finds &quot;ghost&quot; inclusions not
actually required for compilation.  C and C++ projects tend to
accumulate these over time as fossils of old code.

I used gpsd as my guinea pig for the tool.  It found a lot of crap it 
could remove, but also broke the build a few times.  This was expected;
it's not really possible to exclude all false positives, and the tool
has to be applied carefully in the knowledge that some hand-reversion
of the results is likely to be required.

The PPS code happens to be particularly vulnerable because a lot of it is
gated on a symbol defined in &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;, which could be removed without
breaking the compile.  Matters were not helped by the fact that someone
(quite correctly) conditioned the code on this:

    defined(ENABLE_PPS) &amp;&amp; defined(TIOCMIWAIT)

If they had only used defined(ENABLE_PPS) the build would have broken when
I removed the #include.

No, deheader didn't remove that inclusion.  It leaves inclusions
inside #if/#endif alone precisely to avoid subtle problems.  I removed
it by hand, later.  Because while studying the header dependencies in
the code I became disgusted with the thick layer of
conditional-inclusion goo in front of a lot of the source files and
decided to try to get rid of as much of it as possible.

My strategy for doing this was to take POSIX and the Single Unix Specification
seriously, unconditionally include any header that's needed in gpsd and 
specified in the standards, and throw away as many as possible of the autoconf
feature tests - which is a lot of them, because they date from a time when
standards conformance was more a wish and a promise than a reality.  

We are now down to *zero* autoconf-conditional inclusions of system
files - well, not counting the new location of #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;
because it's gated by a feature rather than platform condition, and I
think the PPS code is now the only place that happens.

I love this simplification and intend to keep it.  Someday I'll
probably take a fire ax, chop loose the whole bloated mass of autoconf
crud that is our build system, and replace it with scons or something.
But even this partial decoupling makes the code significantly easier
to read and is going to reduce our porting and long-term maintainance
problems.

As for &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;...if we push the code onto a platform that doesn't have
that file, I *want* the build to break.  Loudly, rather than silently
disabling the feature and leaving someone like you head-scratching 
about the runtime behavior.  I'm pretty sure it won't be a problem
on any of our current target platforms.

I apologize for the transient inconvenience.
