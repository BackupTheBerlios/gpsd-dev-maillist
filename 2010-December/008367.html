<PRE>This is a heads-up for Gary Miller, published here because Chris
Kuethe and possibly others have an interest in subframe decoding. The
subframe unpacking we have is a good start, but it needs substantially
more work before I can turn it into JSON reports.

To fit the libgpsd library architecture, subframe data needs to be
unpacked into a struct element of the session structure and a flag set
to indicate the presence of valid data to be handed to a JSON
report-generation function.  I'll take care of the upper-level data
management and JSON report generation, but there's more low-level work
needed to enable this.

If you look in subframe.c, you'll see that for subframe types 1 and 2
the data is no longer unpacked into local variables.  Instead it's
unpacked into a global of a new type, struct subframe, from which we
take a structure pointer.  At a bit later stage the global will go away
and that pointer will be replaced by a session structure member address,
The subframe structure definition will move to gps.h and become part
of the public API.

The two things that need to happen first are:

1. The change needs to be followed through for subframe types 3, 4, and 5.

2. Each field in the subframe structure needs a one-line winged comment
   in English describing the meaning of the field.

Gary, I think you are probably the logical person to do this; please
give me some idea when you can schedule time so I'll know whether
I have any chance of getting the JSON reporting sone before next release.
