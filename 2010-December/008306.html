<PRE>Hi, folks.  I've just cloned the git tree for the current
development version of gpsd, and have been trying to get it
working... there are some PPS enhancements I'd find it
helpful to have, and some support for early (6-channel) Oncore
VP receivers I'd like to contribute.

It's working for me, except that the serial-port PPS
feature is completely nonfunctional (where 2.92 and 2.95
release versions both work).  ntpd never sees any data in
the PPS shared memory areas, and running gpsd with debugging
turned on shows that PPS events are simply not occurring.

By adding debug printouts I think I've pinned down the cause
of the problem, to a code change made a couple of days ago
to libgpsd_core.c:  cf0546b12c91cb0121a4a643e0c4eef8a27e6997
seems to be the culprit.

This change had the effect of completely eliminating the
following lines:

#ifdef HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H
#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;
#endif /* HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H */

As a result, the TIOCMIWAIT symbol is never defined,
and all of the code which is conditionally compiled
based on the presence of this symbol simply doesn't
get built... the init_kernel_pps and gpsd_ppsmonitor
functions are gone, and the PPS-monitoring thread is not
started.

It looks as if the HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H flag is no longer
being determined by the configuration script... so just
putting these three lines back into libgpsd_core.c doesn't
fix the problem.  Always including &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt; does fix
it for me, but I suspect that this might break compatibility
on some other systems.
