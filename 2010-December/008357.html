Cool, thanks for the clue-stick.

&gt;<i> Still, without a good test case hard to say what the best thing to do

</I>
Especially since device behavior is inconsistent...
* our test framework uses PTYs, not real serial ports
* I can't think of an easy and correct way to emulate a usb garmin
device for testing
* on openbsd, most of the real serial ports are com(4), all usb serial
types (ie. FTDI, Prolific, SiLabs, CDC-ACM, TI) show up as ucom(4) and
bluetooth/rfcomm is handled in userspace and relayed via a PTY.

Reading through the linux device list, I note:
* The linux device list says CDC-ACM (aka, ublox and novatel on-chip
usb) is 166. We're missing this device.
* Cyclades is 19, I actually had a 16-port cyclades, so they're not
that rare. We're missing this device.
* souvik.datta reports that some SoC (nvidia tegra?) uses 253 for
/dev/ttyHS* , which is in the local/experimental range. We're missing
this device.

So the classifier can't know all the devices - it can merely hint. How
do we recover from a wrong guess?

Libusb 1.x works for the things I use it for, such as various jtag
boards and microcontroller bootloaders. Haven't got a gps to test it
with. Libusb 2.x doesn't have an openbsd port, and I think there's
some stuff that libusb2 wants to do that openbsd doesn't support.

</I>&gt;<i> &#160;ugen (usb device not claimed by a driver, usable by libusb)

</I>&gt;<i> and I'm not sure which should get &#160;source_usb.
</I>
What does source_XYZ mean? The receiver has a native XYZ interface?
The link layer mostly behaves as we expect XYZ to?

FTDI, Prolific, SiLabs are more like a serial port than a usb device -
they have pretty much all the same limits as serial, with a few less
features (like control lines). ACM are more like usb devices - they
have a serial port compatibility layer, but they're unfettered by
constraints like speed.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
