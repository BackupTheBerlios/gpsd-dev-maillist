<PRE>
I've looked at your comments in enum_sourcetype and still can't figure
things out.  Before I expand the comments, please check my
understanding:

  Each file descriptor that is treated as a potential source has an
  associated sourcetype_t.

  pty, tcp, and udp I get.  But I don't understand what &quot;not used&quot;
  means.  If you mean &quot;Currently, this value does not trigger any
  special behavior.&quot; we should probably make that clearer.

  blockdev seems like it would be an error.

  I don't really understand what &quot;discoverable&quot; means.

  rs232 means that there is a real serial port on the computer, and the
  file descriptor refers to that serial port.

  usb could cover any of the following

    1) there's a usb/serial converter, and a serial port connection to a
    GPSr

    2) there's a USB GPSr plugged in, and it presents as a generic USB
    serial port

    3) there's a USB GPSr plugged in, and it presents as a generic USB
    device that is not a serial port.

    4) there's a USB GPSr plugged in, and it presents as a USB serial
    port or modem, but has some device identifiers that make it possible
    for us to tag it as a particular kind of device

  [bluetooth probably has similar complexities]

Cases 1 and 2 seem indistinguishable.  I'm not sure 2 exists, but it
seems likely.

As a concrete example, here's a ublox device on NetBSD:

umodem0 at uhub1 port 2 configuration 1 interface 0
umodem0: u-blox AG ANTARIS(r) 4  -  GPS Receiver, rev 1.10/1.00, addr 2, iclass 2/2
umodem0: data interface 1, has CM over data, has no break
umodem0: status change notification available
ucom0 at umodem0

umodem supports all CDC-ACM devices.  All of these get muxed into
ucom(4) which then appear as /dev/dtyU0, dtyU1, etc.

Do you mean that to be 'usb'?  What behavior do you want to control?

Right now I see only two uses:

  jitter estimation in driver_sirf

  avoiding trouble due to oddness in the way Linux LKM garmin_gps works
  (I can't follow this code in a few minutes)
