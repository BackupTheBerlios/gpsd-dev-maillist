Agreed, but I'd think it ought to be possible to auto-adjust this
better than it is.  As I read the Oncore manual, the start of
the Ea or Ba packet is fairly well pinned down in time (to within
30 ms or so of the start of the Oncore GPS measurement epoch).
It should be possible for driver_oncore to be able to &quot;remember&quot;
the time-of-arrival of the start-of-packet character and
correlate this to the time embedded in the packet, and thus
get the SHM(0) time rather closer to correct.

My recollection is that when running 2.92, with the old Oncore VP
6-channel receiver, the SHM(0) time wasn't too terribly bad...
maybe 10-15 milliseconds off... it was good enough that ntpd
would show it as a &quot;-&quot; time source (not being used as a
primary, but close enough to be reasonable).  Right now,
with an Oncore UT+ and with the GIT code, it's showing
up as an &quot;x&quot; (bad!) source.

I'm just curious, at this point, as to whether the difference
is due to the change in GPS boards, or to changes in the
gpsd software since 2.92, or a combination thereof, or
something entirely other.
