<PRE>
  I wouldn't be worrying about this in 2010 except that some of our embedded
  deployments might have 9-year lifetimes.  What should we do?  What
  *can* we do?

A few thoughts:

  Declare that disambiguating the week field into time is the GPS
  receiver's problem.  (I replaced a ROM in a Truetime XL-DC timing
  receiver, sent to me at no charge, during the W1K kerfluffle.)  It's
  easy enough to have nvram/flash, operator entry, or a rom that knows
  when it was compiled and then works for ~19 years.

  If there are GPS receivers that support getting time at powerup to get
  the above right, help them.

  Have gpsd disambiguate 2-digit years using the local clock.  But since
  we release often relative to 100-year rollover, that's not a worry and
  the current &quot;assume 20XX&quot; seems fine.

Also, while I don't argue with your characterization that 64-bit Linux
has 64-bit time_t and thus can cope and 32-bit Linux has 32-bit time_t
and cannot, I find it a bit odd that this type changes size based on
processor, and suggest we be careful about the difference between time_t
size and processor word size.

In NetBSD, time_t is 32 bits, on all architectures, through NetBSD 5.
NetBSD-current has, and thus the upcoming NetBSD 6 will have, 64-bit
time_t on all architectures.  (System calls are versioned so old
binaries will still work.)  I am unclear on the status of the other
BSDs, but assume they'll change to 64-bit time_t long before it's
needed.

Is there any expectation that Linux on i386 will change to 64-bit
time_t?
