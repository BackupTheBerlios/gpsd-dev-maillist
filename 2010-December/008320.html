<PRE>I've done some more looking into the implications of the GPS week rollover bug,
and what I have found is ugly indeed.

The basic problem is that GPS satellites send dates as, in effect, three
numbers: a GPS week, an offset in seconds within the week, and an offset
between cumulative GPS time and UTC. Time is expressed as weeks since
the epoch (1980-01-06T00:00:00) plus an offset in seconds

This would be fine and dandy - you'd get UTC time as

     epoch + (week * SECONDS_PER_WEEK) + seconds + leapoffset

except for one problem. The GPS week counters are short, only 10 bits.  They
roll over every 1024 weeks. The last 10-bit rollover was in 1999; the next
will be in 2019.

Or maybe it's 8192 weeks - Wikipedia claims that &quot;modern&quot; GPS has a 13-bit 
week field.  The first 13-bit rollover will be in 2173.

In trying to track down what &quot;modern&quot; meant, all I could find was
a hint in a corrigendum to ISGPS-2000 that Block IIF satellites have this 
feature; by implication, earlier ones don't.  There's only one IIF bird
up as of now, and it's experimental. I suppose the theory is that they're
going to replace the whole constellation with sats that have the 13-bit 
counter before 2019.

So, when we hit the rollover point, what happens?  On the first
restart after that, our receivers start reporting as though we'd
dropped back in time to the last rollover, currently
1999-08-22T00:00:00.  They can't do anything else.  The week counter
and their epoch is all they have as a calendar.

The hacker known as <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">f4eru at free.fr</A> pointed out consequences:

&gt;<i> - the date is invalid, obviously
</I>&gt;<i> - UTC time is correct, but a local time calculated on this will sometimes 
</I>&gt;<i>   be off +- 1hr, due to wrong DST calculation
</I>&gt;<i> - some receivers may not get a position (mine was fixing correctly)
</I>
These are obvious.  But also

&gt;<i> - Finally, gpsd (and other SW probably) interprets the date &quot;99&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i>   GPRMC as 2099, which gives a 32bit overflow in unix time, gpsmon
</I>&gt;<i>   reports an error &quot;negative date&quot; and a date in 1969 (probably a -1
</I>&gt;<i>   returned from the unix time lib), if i enable the GPZDA frame on
</I>&gt;<i>   the Rx, it reports &quot;correctly&quot; 1999.
</I>
That is correct.  GPSD is caught in a nasty box here; we can't fix the
fact that sentences other than ZDA only return 2-digit years, we can't
force the bit length of time_t to 64 everywhere, and we can't change
the length of the GPS rollover period.  These bugs synergize with each
other.

&gt;<i>                     A 64 bit system will probably report 2099
</I>
Only if it has 64-bit time_t.  64-bit Linux does (I just wrote and ran
the obvious trivial C program to check), but I'm not sure even this is
something we can take for granted on all platforms; it is at least
imaginable that some might pin the size to 4 bits in some desperate
effort to protect binary file compatibility

I wrote a program to check (enclosed) and it at appears that least the
Linux time routines mktime(3) and localtime(3) are 64-bit clean on
64-bit Linux.  I was able to round-trip the ISO date
2099-06-06T00:00:00 through them.  That doesn't save us on 32-bit
machines, though.
  
&gt;<i> Some suggestions :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - correcting the GPRMC date detection to 20xx except 1999 for &quot;99&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   would perhaps be a good thing to do. At least gpsd will be
</I>&gt;<i>   synchron to the GPS info, and no averflow will happen on 32 bit
</I>&gt;<i>   time_t systems. Of course we loose one year before the 2100 bug,
</I>&gt;<i>   but fair enough, that's an order of magnitude away from now than
</I>&gt;<i>   2019
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - trying to compensate the 20 year error can be dangerous coz based
</I>&gt;<i>   on the machine time which can be corrupt also, and, for some
</I>&gt;<i>   applications,will later be based on GPS, etc... but it's feasible
</I>&gt;<i>   if the detection is based on a proper window (ex : machine_utc -
</I>&gt;<i>   gps_utc = n*1024 weeks +- 1 month). The non-trivial part is
</I>&gt;<i>   calculating offsets of exactly n*1024 weeks in UTC in seconds...
</I>
Both these things are possible, but I fear introducing still more subtle
edge cases. The behavior of the system is already quite difficult enough
to reason about.  

For example, suppose we try to implement the second suggestion.  What
should we do about UTC leap seconds, if anything - especially since we 
don't know what leap seconds will be inserted in the future?

I wouldn't be worrying about this in 2010 except that some of our embedded
deployments might have 9-year lifetimes.  What should we do?  What
*can* we do?
