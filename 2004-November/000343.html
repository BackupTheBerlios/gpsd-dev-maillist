<PRE>Hello James,

I did a bit more digging, and agree with your assertion that we can't rely on any of the signals on the serial interface to tell the device is connected.  That said, I think it makes sense to revisit the timer logic for not receiving any data.  Because the interface is continuously being activated and deactivated, the timer keeps being reset.  It seems pretty clear to me that this logic needs to be reworked so that the interface is not considered to be online just because an activate didn't report a failure.

Will see if I can put together a fix that isn't too invasive.

Devin

NMEA was a data format, I thought.  I've got GPS units that do not
provide DTR or anything similar.  While one could adapt the cable to
loop back DTR to DSR and CTS to RTS, and adjust gpsd to sense that
(conditional on a command line flag?), it won't work for everyone all
the time.

Loss of new packets ... that's what I consider a loss of connection.

Yes, I saw that once or twice, but I too was unable to reproduce it.

I had a quick look at the main loop, and the only thing odd I saw was
that a SIGALRM handler calls a function that calls Motif libraries; and
I thought these were not signal reentrant.  At least I was fairly sure X
library isn't.

There's a comment on update_display() that lies;

/* only gets done on sentence receipt, not alarm ticks */

But handle_alarm() calls update_display(), and handle_alarm() is called
by the alarm ticks.

(Reference: revision 1108).
