<PRE>Hello folks,

Finally Open Source is getting the attention of the most prominent 
organization in the GPS community, the Institute of Navigation. I am 
writing to inquire if anyone involved in gpsd would be willing to 
present gpsd to the ION convention in Fort Worth, TX in 2006. Please 
respond to me (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">pben at arlut.utexas.edu</A>) if you are interested.

This is the backstory. Here at the Univesity of Texas at Austin we are 
running an open source project for GPS process called the GPS Toolkit 
(gpstk). Basically this project provides GPS analysis software to the 
GPS community that is LGPL'd. Also there are a number of projects that 
have spawned from Cliff Kelly's receiver programming project called 
OpenSourceGPS. These projects allow the user to control a Mitel/Plessy 
based GPS receiver card to create GPS observatiosn. At the last ION 
convention, in Long Beach, CA, the open source projects project met and 
we discovered a lot of common ground. We are now lobbying the ION to 
recognize the topic of open source and GPS, and we are getting some 
attention. We're trying to get a head count of projects that would 
potentially want to present their work to the next ION.

I realize that the gpsd project was not represented at all at the ION 
2005 and so I want to make sure you know about this opportunity. There 
have been a number of presentations in prior years about the NMEA 
protocols but not one of them have mentioned gpsd. If you are interested 
in presenting to this conference, then this involves a process typical 
for academic presentations. First, you propose an abstract. If 
accepted,  you must travel to the conference to present. Also a paper 
describing your work is required. If  you are interested and would like 
more detailed guidance w.r.t. the application process, I would be glad 
to help.

Regards,
Ben Harris
