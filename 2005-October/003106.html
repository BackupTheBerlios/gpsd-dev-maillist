Crap!  Why can't they donate that much to an open-source group to fix
up their db?  That would buy an awful lot of gps's for folks to keep
on their dashboards as they drive around doing their normal tasks.

&gt;<i> The 2004 &quot;second edition&quot; of the TIGER files reportedly includes many

</I>&gt;<i> realigned county I could find.

I'm set up to check their vectors against the USGS 30cm overhead
overhead imagery for anything in the SF Bay Area and against 10-year
old 1m imagery for the rest of the country.  Do you have any areas I
should try to check?  It might take me a day or three to get
everything in the right form.

So far I only have the full set of 2004-fe data.  I only have a small
part of the 2004-se data.  Somebody seems to get mad at me whenever I
download more than a few megs a day of data and my TCP connections
catch mysterious TCP-restart packets.
