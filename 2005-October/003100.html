&gt;<i> Many, perhaps most, of the presentations represent research. However a

</I>&gt;<i> what the paper has to cover--I think the ION wants to have a convention
</I>&gt;<i> that is relevant to its community. If you look at our first ION paper
</I>&gt;<i> for the GPSTk (it's at www.gpstk.org), you will see that it describes
</I>&gt;<i> the project, and it's a basic HOWTO on getting started building the
</I>&gt;<i> sofware. Our paper this year was an update w.r.t. the first one. I can
</I>&gt;<i> send you that one by request but we can't distribute it on the web just yet.
</I>
I don't mind public speaking, so I might be able to get myself down
there unless someone like Eric or Remco (who've been hacking gpsd
longer than I) want to go speak.

&gt;<i> The presentations are organized into sessions of related topics. This
</I>&gt;<i> year, for example, there were two sessions dedicated to software
</I>&gt;<i> receivers. Also this year, for the first time, there were four papers
</I>&gt;<i> describing open source projects. The papers were grouped with pretty
</I>&gt;<i> dissimilar papers into sessions that were not quite relevant to software
</I>&gt;<i> development. So we are lobbying the ION to see if we can have a session
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated to open source projects.
</I>
I'll have to rummage around and find where I saw this, but I seem to
recall reading a little blurb about how SiRF was working on an
Educational and Open Source support program. I haven't heard anything
more about that, so I will assume that the program has fallen a bit by
the wayside. Still, you might want to check with other, more
established organizations within the GPS world to see if they've got
some sort of open source thing going on and would like to talk about
it. SiRF, through unofficial channels, has been quite cooperative with
us.

&gt;<i> My goal with this email is to let the gpsd folks about the ION in case
</I>&gt;<i> you want to present your work there. I know you are supporting the GPS
</I>&gt;<i> community, and I suspect that more awareness of your work would be good
</I>&gt;<i> for everyone.
</I>
I've been thinking about going for some time now. If I do happen to
go, and people do happen to want to know more about gpsd then I'm more
than happy to give 'em a brain dump. :)

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
