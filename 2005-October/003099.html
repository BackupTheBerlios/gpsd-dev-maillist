<PRE>I also forgot to mention in the previous email that we've set up a list 
for general open source GPS issues. The signup is here:

<A HREF="http://lists.psas.pdx.edu/mailman/listinfo/opengnss">http://lists.psas.pdx.edu/mailman/listinfo/opengnss</A>

Gary and others--I apologize for not giving you more relevant details.

The information about what the Insitute of Navigation is perhaps is best 
obtained from their website at :

<A HREF="http://www.ion.org/">http://www.ion.org/</A>

Here's my brief version. The ION is a nonprofit, special interest group 
focusing on navigation. The ION produces a quarterly, peer reviewed 
journal called Navigation. A very large contingent of that ION group is 
in the Satellite Division. The Satellite Division is focused by and 
large on GPS research and applications.

The ION Satellite Division holds conventions at least twice a year. The 
largest meeting is the international one held once a year in September. 
About 2,000-3,000 people attend. Academics, industry and military all 
attend. There is a trade floor where vendors demonstrate products, and 
give away cute little items. There are a number of technical 
presentations. The presentations are 15 minutes long, with 5 minutes 
more for questions. Each presentation must be accompanied by a paper 
that fits the prescribed format for the ION. There are template 
documents available.

Many, perhaps most, of the presentations represent research. However a 
number of papers describe applications of GPS. Some describe how GPS 
itself is operated and maintained. So there are no defined rules about 
what the paper has to cover--I think the ION wants to have a convention 
that is relevant to its community. If you look at our first ION paper 
for the GPSTk (it's at www.gpstk.org), you will see that it describes 
the project, and it's a basic HOWTO on getting started building the 
sofware. Our paper this year was an update w.r.t. the first one. I can 
send you that one by request but we can't distribute it on the web just yet.

The presentations are organized into sessions of related topics. This 
year, for example, there were two sessions dedicated to software 
receivers. Also this year, for the first time, there were four papers 
describing open source projects. The papers were grouped with pretty 
dissimilar papers into sessions that were not quite relevant to software 
development. So we are lobbying the ION to see if we can have a session 
dedicated to open source projects.

My goal with this email is to let the gpsd folks about the ION in case 
you want to present your work there. I know you are supporting the GPS 
community, and I suspect that more awareness of your work would be good 
for everyone.

Regards,
Ben

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hello folks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Finally Open Source is getting the attention of the most prominent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>organization in the GPS community, the Institute of Navigation. I am writing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to inquire if anyone involved in gpsd would be willing to present gpsd to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>ION convention in Fort Worth, TX in 2006. Please respond to me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">pben at arlut.utexas.edu</A>) if you are interested.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This is the backstory. Here at the Univesity of Texas at Austin we are running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>an open source project for GPS process called the GPS Toolkit (gpstk).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Basically this project provides GPS analysis software to the GPS community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that is LGPL'd. Also there are a number of projects that have spawned from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Cliff Kelly's receiver programming project called OpenSourceGPS. These
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>projects allow the user to control a Mitel/Plessy based GPS receiver card to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>create GPS observatiosn. At the last ION convention, in Long Beach, CA, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>open source projects project met and we discovered a lot of common ground. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are now lobbying the ION to recognize the topic of open source and GPS, and we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are getting some attention. We're trying to get a head count of projects that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>would potentially want to present their work to the next ION.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I realize that the gpsd project was not represented at all at the ION 2005 and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>so I want to make sure you know about this opportunity. There have been a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>number of presentations in prior years about the NMEA protocols but not one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>them have mentioned gpsd. If you are interested in presenting to this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>conference, then this involves a process typical for academic presentations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>First, you propose an abstract. If accepted,  you must travel to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>conference to present. Also a paper describing your work is required. If  you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are interested and would like more detailed guidance w.r.t. the application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>process, I would be glad to help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Ben Harris
