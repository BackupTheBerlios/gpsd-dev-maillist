Yo All!

If you interest is in gpsd and not TIGER, then do not bother to read in
in this slightly off topic post.  My apologies, but I am not sure where
better to start.

My problem is trying to get good geolocation data from a street address.
I want to do it locally, not any back-door kludge to google maps, yahoo
maps, geocoder.us, etc.  I know there are several mapping program authors
on this list, and the topic has come up here in the past.

I have had good luck, so far, with the geooder.us perl modules, called
Geo::Coder::US.  It is a good solution to read raw TIGER files, organize
the data in to a useable Berkeley DB and then perform address-&gt;lat/lon
lookups.  It is a 90% solution for me and one I would like to pursue.

The bad things about the Geo::Coder code is that lack of support and the
surruounding tools.  Geo::Coder could be the core of a generic TIGER
geolocation solution, but it needs more.  It needs a tool to inspect,
search, modify and update the DB for errors and ommisions.  A community
collection of database corrections would also be nice.  Binding to other
languages would also be good, PHP support for Perl and DB is limited at
best.  There are a number of equivalent ways to write an address and
geocoder needs some more smarts to handle common abbreviations and such.
Generic tools to extract zips/fips/city names, etc. would also be usefull.

All the above is fixable, but email to geocoder.us goes unanswered and
I am unable to locate any other forum for geocoder issues.

So, I am opening the subject for debate here.  First off, is there a
better forum for such discussions than gpsd-dev?   Is there a forum
where folks can improve Geo::Coder?  Is there an open source alternative
with promise?
