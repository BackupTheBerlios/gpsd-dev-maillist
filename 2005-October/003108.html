The contract called for semi-automated realignment based on aerial and
satellite pictures, based on image processing and recognition.

The request for bid explained that the Bureau wanted to reuse the tools
for maintaining the database (new streets, I guess) at a lower cost.

The Bureau also rejected a (cheaper?) proposal from a map vendor that
had done some of the work already, but wanted to keep their copyright.
The Bureau required to keep the TIGER database free of copyright.
Praise them!

&gt;<i> I'm set up to check their vectors against the USGS 30cm overhead

Check the USGS position accuracy information first. Not all their scanned
maps are recent, and accuracy can be spotty (plus, not using NAD83!).
I don't know about their imagery (i.e. satellite pictures?).

&gt;<i> So far I only have the full set of 2004-fe data.  I only have a small

</I>
I had no problem downloading 2004se at full speed (about 3Mbits/s) by
night. Thus I don't think it was the Burau's hosts. Contact your ISP :-)
