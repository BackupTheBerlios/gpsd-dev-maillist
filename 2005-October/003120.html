Greetings all,

I've been quietly monitoring this discussion with great interest and this post 
finally motivated me to inject my 2 cents... :^)

After using the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) TIGER/Line data for a couple of 
years now for a GNU/Linux road map application, I've come up with an 
incomplete list of several things that I'd like to improve upon or append to 
that dataset:

(1) a flag to indicate that a road is &quot;1-way&quot;

This would obviously be useful for routing algorithms and also to better 
identify proper freeway exit ramps.

(2) an indicator of road quality -- &quot;paved&quot;, &quot;unimproved&quot; (e.g. gravel), or 
&quot;unknown&quot; (as opposed to assuming that all roads are paved)

This is also useful for routing, especially in rural areas.

(3) a flag to indicate that a road is a toll road (turnpike, etc)

I've used the &quot;Tpke&quot; suffix of the TIGER/Line data's road name to decide 
whether to colorize roads like a toll road, but there are several errors 
(both &quot;false positive&quot; and &quot;false negative&quot;) by using this simplistic 
approach. A flag associated with each line (&quot;TLID&quot; in the TIGER/Line 
vernacular) would be more conclusive.

(4) a flag to indicate that a road is an underpass or overpass

There is a provision for this in the TIGER/Line dataset (Record Type &quot;U&quot;), but 
to my knowledge, no U.S. county/parish data have been released with that 
record type yet.

(5) (obviously) a way to correct the many database errors like:

   (A) erroneous CFCCs (Census Feature Class Code -- e.g. wrong road code, 
like when a freeway code shows up for a line [road] in the middle of a simple 
2-lane road -- don't laugh, it happens!)

   (B) improperly positioned or missing roads (of course, there are loads of 
examples of this problem, but they seem to be getting cleaned up with new 
releases of TIGER/Line)

   (C) missing or erroneous 'street address' ranges for a given line (road)

Some of the simple things (like erroneous CFCCs) would ideally be handled by 
submitting the corrections directly to the USCB, but I've never pursued that 
route so I don't know how feasible that would be or how responsive the folks 
at the USCB would be in incorporating the fixes. One of these days, I will 
try that.

Like many others, I've considered that the most logical thing to do might be 
to have a database of post-processing changes/enhancements to be used against 
the base TIGER/Line database. I agree with Gary Miller's assertion that &quot;A 
community collection of database corrections would also be nice.&quot;

I'd love to see someone or some company initiate such a &quot;TIGER/Line updates 
database&quot; project. I'd gladly contribute as many fixes as I could. I just 
don't know how/if such a thing would get started, but I hope it does. 

Is there anyone on this list who could host such a database? Maybe this is a 
candidate for a SourceForge (or Berlios?) project -- are there any SF 
projects currently which are basically just a big database?

Getting into the nitty-gritty details a bit more, I've decided that you cannot 
really use (just) the TLID (TIGER/Line ID) to associate changes with the 
lines because the USCB could change those line IDs at any time. You really 
need a database that keeps track of the start/end lat/lon of the line (and 
maybe the TLID too as a crude cross-check, assuming it won't change 
frequently), to ensure that the change/enhancement you're applying really 
applies to _that_ line. Alternatively, you could go back and run an automated 
re-check of your database of corrections with each new TIGER/Line database 
release and have human intervention for discrepancies.

What would be really nice (and maybe a good starting point) to have is a 
specification/standardization of the format (XML-based?) for corrections to 
TIGER/Line data. That way, anyone could use _any_ compatible application to 
generate corrections/enhancements to the TIGER/Line data as long as the final 
output was in the standard &quot;database correction&quot; format. Does that make 
sense? Are there better ways to accomplish this?  Just &quot;brainstorming&quot; 
here....

On a related vein, it would be nice to have a database of U.S. freeway exits. 
I've looked in the past but always came up empty. This would be another great 
&quot;community database&quot; to have available. It might be somewhat &quot;automatable&quot; 
given that the TIGER/Line data has a dedicated CFCC ('A63') for &quot;Access ramp, 
the portion of a road that forms a cloverleaf or limited-access interchange&quot;, 
but I've never attempted to automate it and we'd still need a database of the 
actual exit numbers to associate with the road interchange's lat/lon. Again, 
it would be great to develop and agree upon a standardized format for this 
data.

Sorry that this is getting so far off-topic for the GPSD mailing list, but 
like Gary Miller said, I don't really know where else to raise/discuss this 
issue. If anyone has a suggestion on where us TIGER/Line data users can go to 
hash this out, I'm all ears. :^)

Looking forward to other people's thoughts on this whole topic....

Bill Marr
