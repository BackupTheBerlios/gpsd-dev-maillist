Ok, I no doubt pissed off my ISP by downloading the 2004se.  TIGER is
getting bigger all the time.  It is now 5.2G zipped, 47G unzipped.

San Francisco is on the corrected list so I checked the area near the
Golden Gate Park.  The alignment is beautiful!  I compared a dozen
intersections to the USGS high-resolution imagery* and the
registration was always good to within a small number of meters.
Certainly well under the 2 meters I can eyeball.  The offset was
always less than a cars-width and usually less than that.  If they can
keep this up, we are going to have one hell of a nice vector map of
the US.

* I have no doubts that the USGS folks registered the images with
  landmarks they had surveyed to much higher precision than I can
  check.  My handheld gps (Garmin eMap) tends to show tracks
  overlaying the images that more times than not, correctly show which
  lane I was driving in.  The only times I see significant
  misregistration is when the road is on the side of a hill.  In that
  case their elevation model fails them and they end up guessing the
  wrong altitude and miscorrecting for the horizontal position.
