I sent two emails to the census bureau, to signal problems. They
responded to both. The first time to say they agreed this was a
problem and that they found that the problem occurred in several
other places (the problem was a duplicated line ID). The second
time was to explain me why it was not a problem, but my mistake.

Basically, I found the Census Bureau very responsive and professional.
I don't think anyone should send them errata about position accuracy,
since they are working on this in a more efficient way (semi-automated).
However one could try reporting addresses errors to them.

Like for software, fixing the original source is more effective
than forking your own version.
