<PRE>James Cameron &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">quozl at us.netrek.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Summary: perhaps CSIZE &amp; CS7 is more appropriate in serial.c, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than CSIZE &amp; CS8?  What does the standard say?  What does your GPS use?
</I>
I believe the NMEA standard specifies 1 stop bit, 8 data bits, no
parity.  But I'm not certain of this as I have never seen the standard
myself (and don't want to, lest NMEA's lawyers trump up a
copyright-violation charge).  There is at least one person on this
list who has access to a copy; he helped me out about the format of GPVTG.
Perhaps he'll speak up.

&gt;<i> I've been fiddling with an FV18 module and gpsd.  For gpsd to believe in
</I>&gt;<i> the position given by GPGGA, it also needs GPGSA.
</I>
This opens up the vexing question of what the NMEA validity fields mean
and how they interact.

NMEA actually has *three* kinds of validity bits.  Mode, status, and the
Active/Void bit (some sources interpret 'V' as 'Navigation receiver warning').
Sentences that have an Active/Void send V when there is no fix, so the 
position data is no good.

Let's look at which sentences send what:

                GPRMC     GPGLL     GPGGA     GPGSA     PMGNST
Returns fix      Yes       Yes       Yes        No        No
Returns status   No        Yes       Yes        No        Yes
Returns mode     No        No        No         Yes       Yes
Returns A/V      Yes       Yes       No         No        No

The basic question here is: which of these bits is actually meaningful,
and how should they be interpreted?  

We can start by throwing PMGNST out of the table.  It's proprietary,
therefore it cannot be necessary to interpret the state transitions 
in a standard NMEA stream correctly.  Besides, a comment attached to it
says it's only there to recover mode and status if we can't get them 
any other way, and it does so through a layer of deduction.  There is
only some point to that to the extent both fields are meaningful, which
is what we're questioning now.

                GPRMC     GPGLL     GPGGA     GPGSA
Returns fix      Yes       Yes       Yes        No
Returns status   No        Yes       Yes        No
Returns mode     No        No        No         Yes
Returns A/V      Yes       Yes       No         No

My first conclusion from looking at this table is that the designers
of NMEA 0183 should be hung for galloping incompetence.  But never mind that.
What are we to make of this mess?

The fact that the FV18 sends GPMRC/GPGLL/GPGGA but not GPGSA
argues that GPGSA is optional.  I don't see how it can be, since it
seems to be the only status bit that applies to altitude.

Does anyone want to propose a theory of what these flags mean?  Can
someone with a copy of the standard read us chapter and verse?

&gt;<i> But nothing happened.  Very persistently.  So I read through the manual
</I>&gt;<i> more carefully, and found that the serial data format was specified as;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	4800 bps, 1 start bit, 8 data bits (MSB=0), 1 stop bit, no
</I>&gt;<i> 	parity bit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd uses tcsetattr() to configure the port CSIZE &amp; CS8, but does not
</I>&gt;<i> specify the number of stop bits.  CSTOPB appears to be clear in c_cflag,
</I>&gt;<i> which would imply one stop bit.  So it matched fine, but didn't work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I tried CSIZE &amp; CS7, it worked.  Not only did the input sentence
</I>&gt;<i> get processed, but the NMEA output sentences from the GPS arrived in
</I>&gt;<i> fine order.  I presume that the manual for my module is wrong.  But I've
</I>&gt;<i> not yet hooked up equipment to tell what format the actual transmissions
</I>&gt;<i> are in.  I do recall that superfluous stop bits are harmless to the
</I>&gt;<i> receiving unit, normally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The manual-specified data format is functionally equivalent to 7 data
</I>&gt;<i> bits and two stop bits.  Perhaps my system is sending two stop bits
</I>&gt;<i> without me knowing.  
</I>
I find that &quot;1 start bit&quot; highly suspicious.  Look at these diagrams:

|<i> = byte-packet boundary
</I>x = databit
S = start/stop bit

Here are several packets of 8N1:  

     |xxxxxxxxS|xxxxxxxxS|xxxxxxxxS|xxxxxxxxS|

Your manual seems to be describing this:

     |SxxxxxxxxS|SxxxxxxxxS|SxxxxxxxxS|SxxxxxxxxS|

I bet you the receiving UART thinks it's seeing this

     |xxxxxxxxSS|xxxxxxxxSS|xxxxxxxxSS|xxxxxxxxSS|

which, as you say, is 7 bits, no parity 2 stop bits.

&gt;<i> So, does the NMEA standard describe the data word format?
</I>
Various Web sources claim it does.
 
&gt;<i> Do you have a GPS that works with CSIZE &amp; CS7 as well as CS8?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have a method for determining the number of stop bits sent?
</I>
I don't.

&gt;<i> Kernel 2.4.20 is being used on the system running gpsd, in case that is
</I>&gt;<i> significant.  ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The FV18 code fragment that I added to gpsd_open() [not suggesting this
</I>&gt;<i> be taken, it's just a hack]:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	int x;
</I>&gt;<i> 	char buf[82];
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	sprintf(buf, &quot;$PFEC,GPint,GSA01,DTM00,ZDA00,RMC01,GLL01*&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 	nmea_add_checksum(buf + 1);
</I>&gt;<i> 	x=write(ttyfd, buf, strlen(buf));
</I>&gt;<i> 	gpscli_report(1, &quot;=&gt; GPS: (%d) %s&quot;, x, buf);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any generic capability in gpsd for sending configuration
</I>&gt;<i> sentences to a GPS?  I've found the tripmate stuff, but it sounds like
</I>&gt;<i> it might be on the way out.
</I>
No -- the Earthmate stuff may be on the way out.  but my driver structure
is designed to handle cases like yours through initializer functions.

I guess we need an FV18 driver.  I just checked one into trunk; please
test.  It will set 7N2 on open and send the required init string.
You'll have to tell me what its send-cycle time is, and whether
it accepts RTCM. I've assumed &quot;1 second&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;.
