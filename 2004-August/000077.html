<PRE>&gt;<i> Fair warning: I'm growing tired of repeatedly explaining the obvious,
</I>&gt;<i> especially to a person who responds to explanations with obstreperousness.
</I>&gt;<i> You are close to being put in my killfile. If you want to avoid that,
</I>&gt;<i> your next post had better be more constructive than the last three.
</I>
I suppose you should go ahead and add me to your kill file now, since your 
'obvious' assumptions strike me as not at all obvious.  

To sum up:
- The link is not lossless.
- To assume that it is lossless, in the face of examples of lossy links, 
is 'obstreperous.'
- Your idea of returning counts of one sort or another seems like the 
right sort of API to deal with a probabalistic phenomena.


As for this quote:
&gt;<i> Most of the ones I've met appear to be both less                                   
</I>&gt;<i> angry and much better than you at comprehending simple technical terms                                 
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;offline&quot; and &quot;buffered&quot;.        
</I>
It is clear that you consider the state of 'online' to be simple.  I do 
not.  That does not mean I am wrong.

But I understand your frustration.  If I were cornered into 
inconsistancies, such as your claim that the link is 'lossless' then I'd 
also be tempted resort to ad hominum attacks.

Please add me to your kill file now.

</PRE>
