well, portable code still doesn't solve this. i don't like auto* but i 
like most other things less. eally, though, i don't overly care, as long 
as stuff builds and the system which gets it there can be understood and 
modified. i can cope.

If it doesn't come built-in, people don't install it, and I end up sad.
