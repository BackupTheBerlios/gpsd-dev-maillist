I have prepared a tediously long reply to all of the points in this email.  
But at a basic level this paragraph exposes the crux of much of my 
disagreement with the online flag.

-&gt; I don't believe that we can assume that the link between the GPS and 
the host is good enough to not have whole-packet dropouts.  RF is 
intrinsically subject to interference.  Then think sensor arrays with 
hundreds or more GPS units reporting their positions via god knows what method.

-&gt; I believe that the online/offline status is probabalistic, not binary.

-&gt; I believe that if the API gives the programmer a binary flag to 
describe a probabalistic distribution that the programmer will treat that 
as a binary condition and do the wrong thing with it.

-&gt; The only thing this flag _appears_ to do is make it slightly easier to 
report that a person hasn't turned on or connected their GPS.  

My lengthy email is available upon request.
