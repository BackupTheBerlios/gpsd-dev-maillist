As I said before: This is a valid reason to have it, but how much this is 
worth is another question. 

For a second, let's assume this baby is not called gpsd, but locd. That's what 
I should have called it anyway. The source of the location information can 
come from a gps, triangulation on a cell phone, an accurate sundial, or a 
candle with a piece of string (which gives 'online' a totally new meaning.)

Locd promises a few things:
1. It will tell you a location.
2. It will give you an idea how credible 1. is.

This was mapped onto the gps case by saying 'If you have a fix the location 
info is credible'. Then I mixed the 2d/3d stuff in, which was bad.

Locd is a translator. If it does not get at least the information it promises 
its clients, it can not work. If it is given alot more info, no problem.

Translation is 'lossy' (the technical term here is 'messy'.)

Example:
en -&gt; de -&gt; en
&quot;The blue planet&quot; -&gt; &quot;Der blaue Planet&quot; -&gt; &quot;The drunken world&quot;
Only 'policy' can fix this problem.

So, locd is not only mechanism, it can not be and do it's job.
It is not an 'nmea parser and spit it out in another format'.

Take the sundial case: Overcast. No current location information. But since it 
is an accurate sundial it must be stationary, so the cached location has a 
long lifetime. Locd knows that, the application does not. So we can provide 
location with high credibility. Policy.

There clearly are policies encoded in locd. There is a certain amount of 
mangling required to map its input onto its set of promises. The strict 'gps 
only' case somewhat masks that.


Let's talk tcp/udp.

Think of tcp as implemented based on udp (for arguments sake.)

 If you use udp you need also checksums and sequence numbers. Timestamps are 
not good enough, you can not detect holes.
In tcp you just don't worry about it. You pay the overhead in the stack, and 
that's it. If you are planning to supply so many clients with information 
that this overhead becomes noticeable, you are doing something wrong.

Locd uses a request/response protocol. Congestion manifests itself in 
latencies. Let the application draw conclusions about their meaning, locd can 
not.

The concept of 'connectedness' makes life so much simpler. There is just no 
need to scrape tcp of off udp and then implementing your own tcp replacement 
protocol on top of udp. What in tcp do you not like that you propose to do 
better yourself?

I am trying to condense a lot of stuff into one already too long email.
This does lead to inaccuracies, but please look at it as a first approximation 
only. I don't want to write a dissertation. So, please take from this what is 
meaningful to you, and ignore the crap.

Where gpsd comes into this is anybodies guess...
