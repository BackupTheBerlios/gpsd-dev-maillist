 &gt; To sum up:
 &gt; - The link is not lossless.

Who cares?  What matters is that gpsd has stopped receiving data from
the GPS.  There are many reasons why this might happen.  ALL of the
ones I can think of require user attention.  Thus, hiding the fact
that the link is gone is not merely wrong, it is very wrong.

For example:
  o The cable could have come unplugged.
  o The GPS could have run out of power.
  o The host machine could have run out of power (for GPS receivers
    without internal power).
  o There could be something interfering with the bluetooth connection
    between the GPS receiver and the machine running gpsd.

This issue is completely orthogonal to the issue of whether the GPS is
sending data that is valid (has a fix) or not.

gpsd needs to:
 1) let the user program know that the user running the program needs
    to fix the GPS.
 2) let the user program know when was the last time gpsd got a fix
    from the GPS.
