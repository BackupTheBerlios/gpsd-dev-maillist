<PRE>Rich Gibson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">rich at testingrange.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Maybe I'm not catching on, but I expect the software to give me an idea of 
</I>&gt;<i> where I am.  GPS units don't work like just another hotplug device.  They 
</I>&gt;<i> can take a while to get a lock, and they can lose lock at inconvenient 
</I>&gt;<i> plans.  My expectation of the 'right' behavior is to give me the last best 
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I much much prefer a six hour old position with a timestamp to no 
</I>&gt;<i> position.
</I>
And you'll get one. The offline timeout is irrelevant to this.

Here's how it works.  

1. At some time T, your GPS reports a fix to gpsd.
gpsd stores it, with a timestamp.  

2. Suppose at T + 30 seconds later, the GPS goes offline (unplugged,
battery drained, whatever).

3. Then at T + 32 seconds gpsd times out the connection to the GPS and
raises the offine flag.

4. At T + 6 hours later, you query gpsd.  It reports the last fix 
and the fact that status is offline.

&gt;<i> The whole issue of 'offline' sort of confuses me.  Basically, we don't 
</I>&gt;<i> really have a reliable way to know if the GPS is 'online' or 'offline.'  
</I>
If we know that the GPS sends data at least once every X seconds, and
X seconds elapses with no data, we know it's offline.  If it sends data, 
it's online.  That sounds reliable to me.

&gt;<i> But we do know when we got the last useful information from the GPS.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to me that the question of whether 1, 2, or 180 seconds is 'on line' 
</I>&gt;<i> or 'off line' is best left to the client.
</I>
No, because in the general case the client can't know anything about the state
of the gpsd-to-host connection except what the host tells it.

&gt;<i> 'Here is what I know, and this is when I knew this' is what I want from 
</I>&gt;<i> the demon.
</I>
And that is exactly what you now get.
