<PRE>Rich Gibson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">rich at testingrange.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I agree, except that the online/offline status is derived from the time of 
</I>&gt;<i> last fix.
</I>
No, it isn't. It's derived from the time of the last arriving data
from the GPS, whether or not that was associated with a fix.  This is
a very different matter.  The last fix could have been hours ago, but if 
the GPS is alive at all the last data is probably only seconds old.

&gt;<i> An application writer, say me, will say 'ah, gpsd tells me if the gps is 
</I>&gt;<i> online, so I can rely on that.'  The 'better' approach is for the client 
</I>&gt;<i> to say 'hmmm, I have been connected to gpsd for 3 seconds and have yet to 
</I>&gt;<i> see any data, I should raise an alert to the user.'  
</I>
Which is almost exactly what the combination of the online/offline bit and its 
timestamp tells you.  So, as near as I can tell, I'm doing exactly what
you want and you're only having a terminological issue with the way I have
documented it.
 
I say &quot;almost&quot; exactly only because the amount of time with no data is
not a per-client property, so what my code actually enables the client
to (notionally) think is this: &quot;hmmm, gpsd has been up for 3 seconds
and has yet to see any data from the GPS, I should raise an alert to
the user.'

But with respect to your objection, the difference between these two 
assertions is unimportant.

&gt;<i> In a previous message you wrote this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we know that the GPS sends data at least once every X seconds,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and X seconds elapses with no data, we know it's offline.  If it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sends data, it's online.  That sounds reliable to me.
</I>&gt;<i>                                                               
</I>&gt;<i> Except I don't think that is reliable in more than the grossest sense.
</I>&gt;<i> All we know at the host side is that we have not received data for X 
</I>&gt;<i> seconds.  That does not mean that the GPS is offline.  It _may_ mean that 
</I>&gt;<i> the GPS is offline, or it may mean that the GPS went offline since the 
</I>&gt;<i> last 'packet,' but has since returned.
</I>
A difference that makes no difference is no difference.  A tree that
falls in the forest with no one to hear it...if the GPS came up but
didn't ship a packet, that is not only in practice but *in principle*
equivalent to being continuously offline.  There is no observational
test that allows you to distinguish these cases, unless maybe you're
a hardware tech with a logic probe attached to the GPS's traces.

&gt;<i> Think about pinging a server.  If you have a lossy link you will lose 
</I>&gt;<i> packets, but ping doesn't tell us that the server is offline when it loses 
</I>&gt;<i> packets.  
</I>
The analogy is false and misleading.  There are two crucial
differences from the IP case here:

1. The link between the GPS and gpsd, a few feet of serial or USB cable,
   is not lossy.  At least not at any rate relevant to this discussion.

2. The link has a heartbeat.  It's a property of the GPS that, if it's
   alive, it *will* send data at predictable intervals.

These two conditions mean that the absence of a packet at an expected
time actually carries information about the state of the hardware.  If
it ain't there, either the GPS has stopped transmitting or we have a
wire fault.

&gt;<i> The GPS is sending data to GPSD.  Sometimes that process fails for some 
</I>&gt;<i> reason.  Did the GPS just go offline?  GPSD doesn't have enough 
</I>&gt;<i> information to know.
</I>
I'm not sure I even understand this assertion.  It seems to mean that you 
are using the word &quot;offline&quot; in some special way I am unfamiliar with.

Usually, when people say a device is &quot;offline&quot;, they're simply
describing it as being incommunicado -- in fact, as *not having sent
data at an expected time*.  There isn't any causal hypothesis implied
about whether the device has failed internally, or there's a wire
fault.  At most, the term usually implies that the speaker thinks the
machine at *this* end of the wire is not the problem.

This seems to me to fit my use of the term &quot;offline&quot; exactly.  It's
not an interpretation, it's an direct observable -- we have continuously
failed to receive data at times when the GPS was expected to send it.

So, what does the word 'offline' mean when you use it?
