<PRE>I've just found that if one client is blocked in some way (stopped,
network black hole, or some other cause) then eventually the socket
write queue fills up and blocks gpsd.  For a public gpsd, this could be
a denial of service vector, but that's not what I'm thinking of ...
rather I'm thinking of high latency radio network links with
interruptions due to interference or path propogation changes.

So how to handle a full client socket?

The socket writability could be select()ed for, ... which complicates
matters quite a bit, because a socket can be writable for n bytes, we
write n+m, and the program blocks.  We'd have to plan for partial
write() completion and non-blocking sockets.  Which means our own
buffers.

(The code as it stands could experience partial write() completion on a
client socket, which isn't tested for; this is where write() returns
something less than the number of bytes we asked to write.)

Yet another method might be an SIOCOUTQ ioctl() per tcp(7) to get the
size of the unacknowledged output queue for the client.  In conjunction
with a SO_SNDBUF setsockopt() and some heuristic like &quot;things haven't
got better for a while&quot;, we might slow and drop the connection.

Is it a problem worth fixing?  It only matters for NMEA and watch mode.

Here's how to reproduce ...
- run &quot;gpsd -D 2&quot;,
- use telnet to connect a client,
- set it to NMEA full dump mode,
- exert flow control in some way (e.g. kill -STOP ${telnetpid}),
- &quot;watch -d netstat -an|grep 2947'&quot;,
- wait until the buffers reach their maximum point,
- observe gpsd blocked on write() to the client socket,
- restore flow and gpsd resumes.
