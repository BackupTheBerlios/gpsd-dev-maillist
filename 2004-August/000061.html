<PRE>&gt;<i> Rich Gibson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">rich at testingrange.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree, except that the online/offline status is derived from the time of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last fix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, it isn't. It's derived from the time of the last arriving data
</I>&gt;<i> from the GPS, whether or not that was associated with a fix.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> a very different matter.  The last fix could have been hours ago, but if 
</I>&gt;<i> the GPS is alive at all the last data is probably only seconds old.
</I>
Sorry, my typo.   The online/offline status represents the time of the 
last arriving data. 

&gt;<i> &gt; An application writer, say me, will say 'ah, gpsd tells me if the gps is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; online, so I can rely on that.'  The 'better' approach is for the client 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to say 'hmmm, I have been connected to gpsd for 3 seconds and have yet to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see any data, I should raise an alert to the user.'  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which is almost exactly what the combination of the online/offline bit and its 
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp tells you.  So, as near as I can tell, I'm doing exactly what
</I>&gt;<i> you want and you're only having a terminological issue with the way I have
</I>&gt;<i> documented it.
</I>
No, I'm having issues with the API of gpsd making an assertion, off line 
or on line, based on an inference.  And I'm concerned with what 
applications will do with this information that is presented as being 
authoritative, but in fact, is not authoritative.

If the API documentation says 'the online flag reports whether or not the 
GPS is online' then the application writer will trust that to be true.  

&gt;<i> I say &quot;almost&quot; exactly only because the amount of time with no data is
</I>&gt;<i> not a per-client property, so what my code actually enables the client
</I>&gt;<i> to (notionally) think is this: &quot;hmmm, gpsd has been up for 3 seconds
</I>&gt;<i> and has yet to see any data from the GPS, I should raise an alert to
</I>&gt;<i> the user.'
</I>
This is true without the online flag.  Exposing the online flag encourges 
it to be used in troublesome ways.

&gt;<i> &gt; In a previous message you wrote this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If we know that the GPS sends data at least once every X seconds,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and X seconds elapses with no data, we know it's offline.  If it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sends data, it's online.  That sounds reliable to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                                                               
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Except I don't think that is reliable in more than the grossest sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All we know at the host side is that we have not received data for X 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seconds.  That does not mean that the GPS is offline.  It _may_ mean that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the GPS is offline, or it may mean that the GPS went offline since the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last 'packet,' but has since returned.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A difference that makes no difference is no difference.  A tree that
</I>&gt;<i> falls in the forest with no one to hear it...if the GPS came up but
</I>&gt;<i> didn't ship a packet, that is not only in practice but *in principle*
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent to being continuously offline.  There is no observational
</I>&gt;<i> test that allows you to distinguish these cases, unless maybe you're
</I>&gt;<i> a hardware tech with a logic probe attached to the GPS's traces.
</I>
This is sort of my whole point in a nutshell.  gpsd does not actually know 
if the GPS is 'online.'  Your logic is that it is online if we receive 
data before the expiration of the online timeout.  But that is simply an 
inference.

&gt;<i> &gt; Think about pinging a server.  If you have a lossy link you will lose 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packets, but ping doesn't tell us that the server is offline when it loses 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packets.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The analogy is false and misleading.  There are two crucial
</I>&gt;<i> differences from the IP case here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The link between the GPS and gpsd, a few feet of serial or USB cable,
</I>&gt;<i>    is not lossy.  At least not at any rate relevant to this discussion.
</I>
The link between _your_ GPS and gpsd is a few feet of serial or USB cable 
in an apparently noise free environment.  But what if that is not the 
case?  You've dismissed the 'noisy electronics' cases that others have 
made by arguing that in those cases you would not miss the whole sentence, 
but what if you have one of these mini GPS modules that spit out 
NMEA sentences:

<A HREF="http://www.sparkfun.com/shop/index.php?shop=1&amp;cart=91908&amp;cat=63&amp;">http://www.sparkfun.com/shop/index.php?shop=1&amp;cart=91908&amp;cat=63&amp;</A> 

Connected to one of these 'Serial Miniature RF Links:'
<A HREF="http://www.sparkfun.com/shop/index.php?shop=1&amp;cart=91908&amp;cat=62&amp;">http://www.sparkfun.com/shop/index.php?shop=1&amp;cart=91908&amp;cat=62&amp;</A>

Suddenly your GPS is 200-300 feet away from your gpsd (or _much much_ 
further.  That unit is running in the 2.4 ghz band.  I'm running 802.11b 
8+ miles in that band, I'm betting one could get 20 miles with a 
modified version of that 'SMiRF' transceiver).

&gt;<i> 2. The link has a heartbeat.  It's a property of the GPS that, if it's
</I>&gt;<i>    alive, it *will* send data at predictable intervals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These two conditions mean that the absence of a packet at an expected
</I>&gt;<i> time actually carries information about the state of the hardware.  
</I>

&gt;<i> If
</I>&gt;<i> it ain't there, either the GPS has stopped transmitting or we have a
</I>&gt;<i> wire fault.
</I>
Interesting point.  If one limits gpsd to GPS units connected to PC's with 
a 'few feet' of cable you might even be making a compelling case.  But 
then, you couldn't use this Bluetooth GPS:

<A HREF="http://www.socketcom.com/product/GP0804-405.asp">http://www.socketcom.com/product/GP0804-405.asp</A>

Where are the 'wires' you speak of?

No, I don't think my analogy is 'false and misleading' at all.

&gt;<i> &gt; The GPS is sending data to GPSD.  Sometimes that process fails for some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason.  Did the GPS just go offline?  GPSD doesn't have enough 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information to know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I even understand this assertion.  It seems to mean that you 
</I>&gt;<i> are using the word &quot;offline&quot; in some special way I am unfamiliar with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Usually, when people say a device is &quot;offline&quot;, they're simply
</I>&gt;<i> describing it as being incommunicado -- in fact, as *not having sent
</I>&gt;<i> data at an expected time*.  There isn't any causal hypothesis implied
</I>&gt;<i> about whether the device has failed internally, or there's a wire
</I>&gt;<i> fault.  At most, the term usually implies that the speaker thinks the
</I>&gt;<i> machine at *this* end of the wire is not the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to me to fit my use of the term &quot;offline&quot; exactly.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> not an interpretation, it's an direct observable -- we have continuously
</I>&gt;<i> failed to receive data at times when the GPS was expected to send it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, what does the word 'offline' mean when you use it?
</I>
Interesting straw man argument deleted.

Let's go back to 'the tape' as it were, in which you asserted:

Eric Raymond
&gt;<i> The design principle here is that, when you're writing a data
</I>&gt;<i> translator like gpsd, getting between the user and the data --
</I>&gt;<i> imposing your own policy and preconceptions -- is wrong.
</I>                                                                                                                           
How is deciding what 'offline' means different from imposing your own
policy and preconceptions?

You have the proven false preconception that the GPS unit is connected 
with a short length of wire.  What other false preconceptions do you have?

                                                                                                                           
&gt;<i> gpsd's job is mechanism -- getting the data to applications in a useful 
</I>form.
&gt;<i> The application's job is policy -- deciding what to do with it.
</I>                                                                                                                           
But the online/offline status doesn't come from the device, it is created
by the demon.

The offline flag is for the internal use of gpsd, where it is useful.  But 
the act of exposing it in the API provides a false sense of authority.
