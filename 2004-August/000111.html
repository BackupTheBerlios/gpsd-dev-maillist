<PRE>My to-do list for 2.0 is about accomplished, and the code seems to have survived
review on this list.   Here are the remaining issues before we can ship 2.0, on
which I am officially yelling for help:

1. The shared-library mess

Ugh.  libtool makes me want to puke, but I am being forced to the conclusion 
that we may have to use it.  Can I get a patch from somebody that understands
this crap that will 

(a) Arrange for both libgps.a and libgpsd.a to be installed as shared libraries

(b) Do the right things to gpsd.spec.in so RPM will know about them.

(c) And, ideally, beat libtool senseless until it puts the libraries in
the *current* directory, where they're visible, instead of hiding them 
in that evil .libs thing...

2. gps interface needs a tweak

Changing the timestamps to ISO8601 format with optional trailing fractional
seconds made them a bit longer.  The text fields on the data panel in gps need
to be widened a few charcters to accommodate this.  Despite having successfully
added two fields to that panel, I have been unable to figure out where the size
of these text widgets is set.

Is the person who wrote gps still around?  Would somebody other than me please
take a look at the Motif code in gps in case I've missed something stupid and
obvious?

3. Testing on EarthMate and TripMate

Would somebody please test the device types that aren't straight NMEA?
(This translates as: Hey, you, Russ!  Get off your tuchis! :-))

4. The strange math problem in gpsprobe 

I have a Python script I'd like to ship with 2.0, called gsprobe.  It
watches the NMEA from a GPS and tries to deduce things about the GPS.
It generates a gnuplot scattergram of fixes you can use to empirically
check accuracy against the reported HDOP.

However, something is awry in my calculation of the actual uncertainty 
of position, going from degrees of uncertainty to meters.  I posted about 
this earlier today.  Help!

5. Should PRWIZCH support drop out entirely?

I asked this question before and nobody answered.  At the moment I have the
PRWIZCH handling conditioned out.  I'd like to drop it entirely -- the 
information it gives is redundant with the SNRs in GPGSV, and the Zodiac
chipset reported GSVs.  

Does anyone know any good reason not to just drop this code?

&quot;As to the species of exercise, I advise the gun. While this gives [only]
moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence
to the mind.  Games played with the ball and others of that nature, are too
violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun,
therefore, be the constant companion to your walks.&quot;
