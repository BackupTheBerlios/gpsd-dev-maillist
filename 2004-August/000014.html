<PRE>&gt;<i> Release 1.94 of gpsd is now available at:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/</A>
</I>

Doesn't build:  display.c is missing from gpsd-1.94.tar.gz.

svn.berlios.de seems to be temporarily jammed, so I can't grab it to
test any further right now.


&gt;<i> My assumption is that every GPS delivers data at least once per
</I>&gt;<i> second.  This interval is now a data member in the driver type
</I>&gt;<i> structure.  I could bring back the -t timeout option to override
</I>&gt;<i> this, but would prefer not to unless there is real hardware that
</I>&gt;<i> needs it.
</I>
Unsure if you mean a complete cycle of messages every second or at least
one individual sentence per second.


At 4800 baud, my Garmin 48 (pretty much the same thing as the 12XL)
spits out a complete set of NMEA sentences about once per every 2.1
seconds, with about a half second pause at the end. At slower baud rates
it takes longer than a full second between sets.

 - at 9600 baud there is a 0.1 sec pause between sets of msgs
 - at 4800 baud there is a 0.5 sec break between sets
 - at 2400 baud there is a 1.5 sec break between sets
 - at 1200 baud there is a 3.3 sec break between sets
 - at 600 baud there is a 7 sec break between sets
 - at 300, ~ 10 sec pause, $GPGSV takes about 2.1 sec to xmit.

So a 1 sec timeout limits us to 4800 baud+.  :-/


for the Garmin:
  longest sentence I see is $GPGSV; 63+\n chars long.

at n,8,1 that's 576 bits, so if it is testing time between each new
sentence, 600 baud will be the minimum supported that way, but probably
be flaky.

The Garmin will transmit down to 130 baud, FWIW.
