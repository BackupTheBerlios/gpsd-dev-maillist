<PRE>G'day,

Summary: perhaps CSIZE &amp; CS7 is more appropriate in serial.c, rather
than CSIZE &amp; CS8?  What does the standard say?  What does your GPS use?

I've been fiddling with an FV18 module and gpsd.  For gpsd to believe in
the position given by GPGGA, it also needs GPGSA.  The FV18 was not
providing GPGSA.  GPGSA didn't contain anything I really needed, but
since gpsd wanted it, I went looking for how to enable it.

The FV18 manual told me how to enable it; and how to disable the
sentences that I didn't need.  Send a proprietary sentence to the GPS
...

	$PFEC,GPint,GSA01,DTM00,ZDA00,RMC01,GLL01*

But nothing happened.  Very persistently.  So I read through the manual
more carefully, and found that the serial data format was specified as;

	4800 bps, 1 start bit, 8 data bits (MSB=0), 1 stop bit, no
	parity bit.

gpsd uses tcsetattr() to configure the port CSIZE &amp; CS8, but does not
specify the number of stop bits.  CSTOPB appears to be clear in c_cflag,
which would imply one stop bit.  So it matched fine, but didn't work.

When I tried CSIZE &amp; CS7, it worked.  Not only did the input sentence
get processed, but the NMEA output sentences from the GPS arrived in
fine order.  I presume that the manual for my module is wrong.  But I've
not yet hooked up equipment to tell what format the actual transmissions
are in.  I do recall that superfluous stop bits are harmless to the
receiving unit, normally.

The manual-specified data format is functionally equivalent to 7 data
bits and two stop bits.  Perhaps my system is sending two stop bits
without me knowing.  

So, does the NMEA standard describe the data word format?

Do you have a GPS that works with CSIZE &amp; CS7 as well as CS8?

Does anyone have a method for determining the number of stop bits sent?

Kernel 2.4.20 is being used on the system running gpsd, in case that is
significant.  ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A

The FV18 code fragment that I added to gpsd_open() [not suggesting this
be taken, it's just a hack]:

	int x;
	char buf[82];

	sprintf(buf, &quot;$PFEC,GPint,GSA01,DTM00,ZDA00,RMC01,GLL01*&quot;);
	nmea_add_checksum(buf + 1);
	x=write(ttyfd, buf, strlen(buf));
	gpscli_report(1, &quot;=&gt; GPS: (%d) %s&quot;, x, buf);

Is there any generic capability in gpsd for sending configuration
sentences to a GPS?  I've found the tripmate stuff, but it sounds like
it might be on the way out.
