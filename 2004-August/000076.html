<PRE>Rich Gibson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">rich at testingrange.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> GPS to host links should not be considered effectively lossless.  Eric 
</I>&gt;<i> agrees that the goal of the online flag is to hide information about the 
</I>&gt;<i> GPS's send-cycle interval (he says 'buffer' which means 'hide' to me).  
</I>&gt;<i> I think that is a bad idea.
</I>
OK, let's try one more time.  &quot;Buffer&quot; does not mean &quot;hide&quot; on any
planet I have ever visited.  I am not able rightly to apprehend the
kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a statement.

gpsd is designed to support asynchronous queries by clients, The idea
is that they always get the latest information gpsd *buffered* from
the GPS's data stream.  They don't know how often that buffer is
updated, nor (if gpsd is doing its job) should they need to know.

&gt;<i> How does not including the online/offline status make it quite a bit more 
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to determine online/offline status?  Why can't we just do what 
</I>&gt;<i> you wrote here and, minus the online status, let the applciation decide?
</I>
Because the application doesn't know either the GPS's send-cycle
interval or the timing of incoming sentences (unless it's in raw mode,
which as Remco has observed rather defeats the whole point of gpsd).
Therefore the application doesn't know when a missed packet is a
missed packet.  Only the daemon has that information.

Would it make you any happier if the field counted consecutive send
intervals with no data?  That might be a good change; it would convey
more information, and application developers who know their host-to-GPS
link is effectively lossless could treat it as an offline flag.

&gt;<i> Compare that with what the thinking process that will occur with the flag:
</I>&gt;<i> 'gpsd set the online flag so I can count on the data.'
</I>
Perhaps you should stop projecting your own thought processes onto
other programmers?  Most of the ones I've met appear to be both less
angry and much better than you at comprehending simple technical terms
like &quot;offline&quot; and &quot;buffered&quot;.

Fair warning: I'm growing tired of repeatedly explaining the obvious,
especially to a person who responds to explanations with obstreperousness.
You are close to being put in my killfile. If you want to avoid that,
your next post had better be more constructive than the last three.
