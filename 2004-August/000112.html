</I>&gt;<i> Ugh.  libtool makes me want to puke, but I am being forced to the
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion that we may have to use it.  Can I get a patch from somebody
</I>&gt;<i> that understands this crap that will

</I>&gt;<i> (a) Arrange for both libgps.a and libgpsd.a to be installed as shared
</I>&gt;<i> libraries
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (b) Do the right things to gpsd.spec.in so RPM will know about them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (c) And, ideally, beat libtool senseless until it puts the libraries in
</I>&gt;<i> the *current* directory, where they're visible, instead of hiding them
</I>&gt;<i> in that evil .libs thing...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yup, life's a bitch. Now I remember why I did not go there. It's hard.

&gt;<i> 2. gps interface needs a tweak
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Changing the timestamps to ISO8601 format with optional trailing fractional
</I>&gt;<i> seconds made them a bit longer.  The text fields on the data panel in gps
</I>&gt;<i> need to be widened a few charcters to accommodate this.  Despite having
</I>&gt;<i> successfully added two fields to that panel, I have been unable to figure
</I>&gt;<i> out where the size of these text widgets is set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is the person who wrote gps still around?  Would somebody other than me
</I>&gt;<i> please take a look at the Motif code in gps in case I've missed something
</I>&gt;<i> stupid and obvious?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This would be me. I was quite up on Motif a decade ago. I am very happy that I 
was able to forget most of it. 
If things don't get too wild I'll have a look on the week end.

&gt;<i> 3. Testing on EarthMate and TripMate
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would somebody please test the device types that aren't straight NMEA?
</I>&gt;<i> (This translates as: Hey, you, Russ!  Get off your tuchis! :-))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Caught me again. This time I am not going to plead the fifth. I remember what 
I did. I am just not going to do it again. I doubt that there are more than 
three people out there using those. Let them file bug reports.

&gt;<i> 4. The strange math problem in gpsprobe
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a Python script I'd like to ship with 2.0, called gsprobe.  It
</I>&gt;<i> watches the NMEA from a GPS and tries to deduce things about the GPS.
</I>&gt;<i> It generates a gnuplot scattergram of fixes you can use to empirically
</I>&gt;<i> check accuracy against the reported HDOP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, something is awry in my calculation of the actual uncertainty
</I>&gt;<i> of position, going from degrees of uncertainty to meters.  I posted about
</I>&gt;<i> this earlier today.  Help!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The first time I tackled that it was a challenge, this now sounds like a 
chore ;-)
I wish I had the time.

&gt;<i> 5. Should PRWIZCH support drop out entirely?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I asked this question before and nobody answered.  At the moment I have the
</I>&gt;<i> PRWIZCH handling conditioned out.  I'd like to drop it entirely -- the
</I>&gt;<i> information it gives is redundant with the SNRs in GPGSV, and the Zodiac
</I>&gt;<i> chipset reported GSVs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know any good reason not to just drop this code?
</I>
It is only redundant if you have more than one source giving you the same 
information. Are there devices giving you only PRWIZCH and not any of the 
others? In other words, is it really always redundant?

P.s.: ' I asked this question before and nobody answered'? I certainly have 
not seen the question. And I get doubles on every message to the list.
