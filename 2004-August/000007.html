<PRE>James Cameron &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">quozl at hwy.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Using the -n flag caused serial data overrun, because the fdin wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> being set when nowait was set, causing the select() call to ignore the
</I>&gt;<i> GPS file descriptor.  Watching the debug log showed &quot;GPS has n chars
</I>&gt;<i> waiting&quot; where n grows up to 4096.
</I>
Good catch.  I had wondered what was causing that.
 
&gt;<i> Once I had fixed that, a client command caused the &quot;GPS is offline&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> message and no data would be read.  This seemed to because gpsd_poll()
</I>&gt;<i> was returning zero for no-pending-data, yet that was triggering an
</I>&gt;<i> offline.
</I>
That's not the behavior I'm seeing here.  What OS are you running?

&gt;<i> The attached patch does this;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - fixes a minor spelling nit in gpsd manual page,
</I>
Taken.

&gt;<i> - removes the reopen flag (there didn't seem to be a need for it),
</I>
In the current trunk version reopen is no longer set by sigusr, but it's 
still used to recover from an offline condition.

&gt;<i> - sets session.fdin after gpsd_activate() made due to nowait,
</I>
Taken.

&gt;<i> - do not go offline if no data is available,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm *not* confident that the last change is right, as it disables the
</I>&gt;<i> offline detection.  But the existing design confuses me; I can't see how
</I>&gt;<i> a return of 0 from gpsd_poll() can reliably be used to assert an offline
</I>&gt;<i> condition ... with an NMEA message per second and a select() timeout of
</I>&gt;<i> one second, it *might* still be possible for is_input_waiting() to
</I>&gt;<i> return zero in normal operation.  If a client sends a request, the
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd_poll() check is also called before the select() times out
</I>&gt;<i> naturally.
</I>
No, this change isn't right.  We need to figure out what is.

What I'm really trying to do here, of course, is detect if the GPS has
been unplugged.  I originally coded that test to check to see if the
FIONREAD ictl in is_input_waiting() returns an error (-1), but it
turned out not to -- which I think tells me Linux thinks the GPS is
stll open after it's unplugged.  So a no-wait read(2) won't work
either.

I though the odds of occasionally getting a spurious 0 here were 
acceptable, because my GPS seems to stream data continuously rather
than once per second.  Can anyone suggest a better test?
