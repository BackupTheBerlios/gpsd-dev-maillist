<PRE>Attention conservation summary: 

GPS to host links should not be considered effectively lossless.  Eric 
agrees that the goal of the online flag is to hide information about the 
GPS's send-cycle interval (he says 'buffer' which means 'hide' to me).  
I think that is a bad idea.


&gt;<i> So Kismet, or gpsdrive, or any one of several other applications I can
</I>&gt;<i> think of that are used in the normal case of an effectively lossless 
</I>&gt;<i> GPS-to-host link, can easily have an idiot light labeled &quot;GPS not plugged in.&quot;
</I>
Bluetooth GPS's are not 'effectively lossless,' and are exactly the sort 
of bleeding edge tech that people using in-car wardriving and monitoring 
tools are likely to use.

These are also _exactly_ the class of applications that should not have 
spurious error messages.  At all.  A driver should generally not be given 
non-actionable information, and certainly not non-actionable late or wrong 
information.  A binary flag encourages the programmer to rely on that information 
as being meaningful.

Forcing the programmer to look at a timestamp and make his own inference 
about what that messy information means encourages a more nuanced use 
and presentation of connectivity status to the end user.

&gt;<i> This would be quite a bit more difficult without the flag, as the clients
</I>&gt;<i> aren't aware of the GPS's send-cycle interval.  Nor should they be; buffering
</I>&gt;<i> against that cycle is the daemon's job.
</I>
You just made my case.  Earlier you wanted to solve the problem of bad use 
of the online flag by more documentation of the assumptions that 
underly that flag.  But here you specifically assert that 'buffering' (ie. 
hiding) that information is the point of the flag.

A programmer attempting to determine if the GPS is offline absolutely must 
be aware of the GPS's send cycle interval.  The API must not hide that 
information.  Having the flag, even with documentation, effectively hides 
that information.

Earlier you wrote:

&gt;<i>The better way is to hand the application a bundle consisting of the
</I>&gt;<i>fix, the time of fix, and the current online/offline status, and let
</I>&gt;<i>the *application* decide what those bits mean.
</I>
How does not including the online/offline status make it quite a bit more 
difficult to determine online/offline status?  Why can't we just do what 
you wrote here and, minus the online status, let the applciation decide?

This was from another message of yours.  I think it perfectly describes 
the case:

&gt;<i>&quot;hmmm, gpsd has been up for 3 seconds                  
</I>&gt;<i>and has yet to see any data from the GPS, I should raise an alert to                  
</I>&gt;<i>the user.'                     
</I>
Compare that with what the thinking process that will occur with the flag:
'gpsd set the online flag so I can count on the data.'

An online flag is simply a statement of your assumptions about the 
meaning of the data coming (or not) from the GPS.  And then basically (see 
above) you want to hide the GPS send-cycle interval from the application 
so that by default it will rely on your assumptions about online status.
