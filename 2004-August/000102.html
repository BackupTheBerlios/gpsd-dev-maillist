 &gt; Thank you, I don't care for build tools that pull this much weird,

There is.  qmail's build process points to it.  First, you program to
a standard, portable library.  That nukes at least half of what
libtool does.  Second, if you really need to make decisions, then you
make them with a tiny test program which you compile and run.  That
program creates a shell script which does the right thing.  For
example, all compiled programs are compiled by the 'compile' shell
script, upon which they also depend.  Compile is created from a
'make-compile' shell script, which is built up from smaller parts.
Compile depends on make-compile, which depends on the smaller parts.

If you change *anything*, then *everything* that depends on it gets
rebuilt.  There is no 'make clean' because there's never a need to
delete intermediate files because *everything* is named in the
Makefile.

Yes, this needs tools, and no, those tools haven't been created yet.
That's why everybody uses libtool, plus the fact that almost nobody
understands how to write a Makefile.  And why should they, when
Makefiles get automatically built?
