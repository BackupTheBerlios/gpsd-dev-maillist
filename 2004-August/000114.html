<PRE>Remco Treffkorn &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">remco at rvt.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Is the person who wrote gps still around?  Would somebody other than me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; please take a look at the Motif code in gps in case I've missed something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stupid and obvious?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be me. I was quite up on Motif a decade ago. I am very
</I>&gt;<i> happy that I was able to forget most of it.  If things don't get too
</I>&gt;<i> wild I'll have a look on the week end.
</I>
Thanks.  It's a small thing, but ought to be fixed.

The alternative is to just scrap the Motif code entirely -- build a
new gps workalike using Glade and GTK++.  I'd probably do it in Python;
I learned earlier today that Russ's pygps code already has the satellite
display in it, which would be the only hard part.

&gt;<i> &gt; Would somebody please test the device types that aren't straight NMEA?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (This translates as: Hey, you, Russ!  Get off your tuchis! :-))
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Caught me again. This time I am not going to plead the fifth. I remember what 
</I>&gt;<i> I did. I am just not going to do it again.
</I>
That was &quot;Russ&quot; I was prodding, not &quot;Remco&quot;.  He promised to test with 
the Earthmate.

&gt;<i>                                     I doubt that there are more than 
</I>&gt;<i> three people out there using those. Let them file bug reports.
</I>
Considering that the product seems to have been discontinued in 1998
or earlier, you're probably right.  Perhaps it's time to just drop the
EarthMate support entirely.  If I did that I could get rid of
gpscli_report().  Simpler is good...

&gt;<i> It is only redundant if you have more than one source giving you the same 
</I>&gt;<i> information. Are there devices giving you only PRWIZCH and not any of the 
</I>&gt;<i> others? In other words, is it really always redundant?
</I>
I find 79 hits for PRWIZCH on the net.  All the ones I've looked at
that give NMEA samples or specify a list of sentences reported also
have GPGSVs in them.  Here are the top few:

<A HREF="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/gps/nori/Jupiter/1stdata.txt">http://www.ne.jp/asahi/gps/nori/Jupiter/1stdata.txt</A>
<A HREF="http://203.141.15.20/50m_5el_2st/satk_test/0900_bin_ok_log.txt">http://203.141.15.20/50m_5el_2st/satk_test/0900_bin_ok_log.txt</A>

So it looks as if the Rockwell chipset generated both PRWIZCH and GPGSV.
The difference is that PRWIZCH reports per-channel signal strength, while
GPGSV reports signal-to-noise ratios in decibels.  Practically speaking 
one is as good as the other -- even the Zodiac chipset manual I found doesn't
really explain why PRWIZCH exists.

&gt;<i> P.s.: ' I asked this question before and nobody answered'? I certainly have 
</I>&gt;<i> not seen the question. And I get doubles on every message to the list.
</I>
I probably typoed the address, then.
