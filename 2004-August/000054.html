<PRE>Before I get into my problem with the online flag, I want to say that I 
totally approve of _not_ timing out stale data.  Mainting the stale data, 
but returning the date, seems like the right choice.

&gt;<i> The better way is to hand the application a bundle consisting of the
</I>&gt;<i> fix, the time of fix, and the current online/offline status, and let
</I>&gt;<i> the *application* decide what those bits mean.
</I>
I agree, except that the online/offline status is derived from the time of 
last fix.  So this gives the application the sense that offline/online is 
authoritative.  But it isn't real at all.  This is not like a serial port 
carrier detect where we can know what is happening when it happens.

The problem with giving the client the impression of authoritative 
information is that the client is then likely to pass that information on 
to the user in a way that is not helpful.

An application writer, say me, will say 'ah, gpsd tells me if the gps is 
online, so I can rely on that.'  The 'better' approach is for the client 
to say 'hmmm, I have been connected to gpsd for 3 seconds and have yet to 
see any data, I should raise an alert to the user.'  

In a previous message you wrote this:
&gt;<i> If we know that the GPS sends data at least once every X seconds, and                             
</I>&gt;<i> X seconds elapses with no data, we know it's offline.  If it sends data,                          
</I>&gt;<i> it's online.  That sounds reliable to me.                                                         
</I>                                                                                                    
Except I don't think that is reliable in more than the grossest sense.                              
All we know at the host side is that we have not received data for X                                
seconds.  That does not mean that the GPS is offline.  It _may_ mean that 
the GPS is offline, or it may mean that the GPS went offline since the 
last 'packet,' but has since returned.

Think about pinging a server.  If you have a lossy link you will lose 
packets, but ping doesn't tell us that the server is offline when it loses 
packets.  

The GPS is sending data to GPSD.  Sometimes that process fails for some 
reason.  Did the GPS just go offline?  GPSD doesn't have enough 
information to know.

&gt;<i> The design principle here is that, when you're writing a data
</I>&gt;<i> translator like gpsd, getting between the user and the data --
</I>&gt;<i> imposing your own policy and preconceptions -- is wrong.
</I>
How is deciding what 'offline' means different from imposing your own 
policy and preconceptions?

&gt;<i> gpsd's job is mechanism -- getting the data to applications in a useful form.
</I>&gt;<i> The application's job is policy -- deciding what to do with it.
</I>
But the online/offline status doesn't come from the device, it is created 
by the demon.

&gt;<i> Timing out stale information is not mechanism, it's policy.  It's not gpsd's 
</I>&gt;<i> job, it's the application's.  And this is why I ripped out all the staleness 
</I>&gt;<i> checks in gpsd. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Good!  I agree!  What is stale is interpretation.  And so is the online 
status of the device.
