<PRE>Remco Treffkorn &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">remco at rvt.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> A gps that has lost fix is still 'online'. You get correct information from 
</I>&gt;<i> it. It tells you that it lost the fix, and gives you probably the LKG 
</I>&gt;<i> position.
</I>
If LKG = &quot;last known good&quot;, then yes.

&gt;<i> If you pull the serial connector out from the gps it has become
</I>&gt;<i> 'offline'. You get no information from the gps any more, although it
</I>&gt;<i> still might have a fix.  In that case we should indicate 'no fix'
</I>&gt;<i> and just repeat the old data.
</I>
Current behavior is to not change the mode at all.  Instead, if the
application cares about the age of the fix, it can check the
timestamp.

&gt;<i> The 'online' vs. 'offline' state is just internal to gpsd, and should not be 
</I>&gt;<i> client visible. The client only needs to know that the current position is 
</I>&gt;<i> old and not reliable.
</I>
I disagree.  The whole reason I implemented offline detection was to
be client-visible, so the client can inform the user.  It usually
means &quot;Duh.  You forgot to plug in your GPS sensor.&quot;  Remember, I'm a
laptop user with a USB GPS mouse, not a meteorologist hardwiring an
instrument package for weather balloons (or whatever).

If the application wants to make a decision about whether the fix is too old
to be reliable, it can look at the timestamp.

If gpsd were to step on the mode because it thinks the fix information
is stale, or because the GPS is offline, it would actually be
*destroying* information -- that is, the fact that the last fix was
actually good is now lost.   

The better way is to hand the application a bundle consisting of the
fix, the time of fix, and the current online/offline status, and let
the *application* decide what those bits mean.

The design principle here is that, when you're writing a data
translator like gpsd, getting between the user and the data --
imposing your own policy and preconceptions -- is wrong.

gpsd's job is mechanism -- getting the data to applications in a useful form.
The application's job is policy -- deciding what to do with it.

Timing out stale information is not mechanism, it's policy.  It's not gpsd's 
job, it's the application's.  And this is why I ripped out all the staleness 
checks in gpsd.
