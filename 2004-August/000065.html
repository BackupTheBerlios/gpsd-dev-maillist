<PRE>Rich Gibson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">rich at testingrange.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> If the API documentation says 'the online flag reports whether or not the 
</I>&gt;<i> GPS is online' then the application writer will trust that to be true.  
</I>
At present the flag is not documented, so there is no such assertion.
You seem to be spinning up an awful lot of disputation about something that
does not, in fact, exist.
 
&gt;<i> This is true without the online flag.  Exposing the online flag encourges 
</I>&gt;<i> it to be used in troublesome ways.
</I>
What ways would those be? Spin me a scenario, please.
 
&gt;<i> This is sort of my whole point in a nutshell.  gpsd does not actually know 
</I>&gt;<i> if the GPS is 'online.'  Your logic is that it is online if we receive 
</I>&gt;<i> data before the expiration of the online timeout.  But that is simply an 
</I>&gt;<i> inference.
</I>
That's right.  It's an inference in the same sense that we infer the
continued existence of a GPS at the other end of the wire (actually,
it's the *same* inference as that one).  Making such inferences is not
bad interface design; it is, in fact, necessary.  What can be bad is
when you destructively substitute an inference for actual data, which
nobody has proposed doing in this case.
 
Your error (or one of your errors, anyway) is that you have seized on
the &quot;inference&quot; part and forgotten the &quot;destructive&quot; part.  Inferences
that are lossless aren't a problem; if the logic used to generate them
doesn't match your causal analysis, you just ignore them.  In this
particular case, if you have causal reason to believe the online flag
is unreliable, you ignore it.

It's the *lossy* inferences, like when a policy about timeouts steps
on the mode bit, that are a problem.

&gt;<i> Suddenly your GPS is 200-300 feet away from your gpsd (or _much much_ 
</I>&gt;<i> further.  That unit is running in the 2.4 ghz band.  I'm running 802.11b 
</I>&gt;<i> 8+ miles in that band, I'm betting one could get 20 miles with a 
</I>&gt;<i> modified version of that 'SMiRF' transceiver).
</I>
I'm not seeing a point here yet.  Do you think you're going to get 
whole-packet dropouts in this setup?

&gt;<i> Interesting point.  If one limits gpsd to GPS units connected to PC's with 
</I>&gt;<i> a 'few feet' of cable you might even be making a compelling case.  But 
</I>&gt;<i> then, you couldn't use this Bluetooth GPS:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.socketcom.com/product/GP0804-405.asp">http://www.socketcom.com/product/GP0804-405.asp</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where are the 'wires' you speak of?
</I>
OK, channel fault,  The logic still applies.  As long as the link to the
wireless is good enough to not have whole-packet dropouts, the online
flag is still reliable and still useful.  Physical wire is not necessary
for this condition to be true, as was obvious to me and I presume is
to you as well.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The GPS is sending data to GPSD.  Sometimes that process fails for some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reason.  Did the GPS just go offline?  GPSD doesn't have enough 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; information to know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure I even understand this assertion.  It seems to mean that you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are using the word &quot;offline&quot; in some special way I am unfamiliar with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Usually, when people say a device is &quot;offline&quot;, they're simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; describing it as being incommunicado -- in fact, as *not having sent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data at an expected time*.  There isn't any causal hypothesis implied
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about whether the device has failed internally, or there's a wire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fault.  At most, the term usually implies that the speaker thinks the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine at *this* end of the wire is not the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems to me to fit my use of the term &quot;offline&quot; exactly.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not an interpretation, it's an direct observable -- we have continuously
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; failed to receive data at times when the GPS was expected to send it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, what does the word 'offline' mean when you use it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting straw man argument deleted.
</I>
Actually, interesting non-straw-man argument neither deleted nor answered.
I'm still waiting to hear a definition of &quot;offline&quot; other than &quot;did not
send an expected signal at an expected time&quot;, which is precisely what
the online flag conveys.
 
&gt;<i> How is deciding what 'offline' means different from imposing your own
</I>&gt;<i> policy and preconceptions?
</I>
That's easy. Because it doesn't step on or lose any of the lower-level
data used to make the inference.

&gt;<i> You have the proven false preconception that the GPS unit is connected 
</I>&gt;<i> with a short length of wire.  What other false preconceptions do you have?
</I>
My &quot;preconception&quot; had nothing to do with physical wire, it's was that
the channel is not lossy at a level that loses entire sentence groups.
I think you understood this.  Fight nice, please.

&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd's job is mechanism -- getting the data to applications in a useful 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form. The application's job is policy -- deciding what to do with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the online/offline status doesn't come from the device, it is created
</I>&gt;<i> by the demon.
</I>
So are the latitudes and longitudes in the position information.

Oh, you don't see how?  Look in nmea_parse and you'll see that their
representation gets hacked by gpsd is they passs through, from an odd 
hybrid degrees-and-minutes format to pure decimal degrees.

&quot;But wait!&quot; I hear you protest.  &quot;gpsd didn't create that data, it was
translated from state changes on the wire to the GPS!&quot;

Well, the same is true of the online flag.  Lossless inference in both
cases.
