<PRE>Remco Treffkorn &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">remco at rvt.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> In the presence of this list, why did you labor/suffer in silence?
</I>&gt;<i> Or did I just miss your pleas for help?
</I>
Apparently you did.  None of this was done quietly.

&gt;<i>       And that would have been a cop-out, because there are
</I>&gt;<i> a number of ways to multiplex reliably on 2947.
</I>
Every one I tried had insuperable flaws.

&gt;<i> Can we please fix this, or are you dead set on crippling gpsd?
</I>
Don't you *dare* take that tone with me, Remco.  We have a transition
problem precisely because the old protocol design - *your* design -
was weak on several levels, lacked extensibility, had to be replaced
when it ran out of namespace, and didn't self-describe or identify
itself with a greeting header.

I've never said what I really thought of the old protocol design
before because publicly trashing it would have served no purpose; better
to quietly fix what problems were fixable, which is what I did. The
truth is, it was a botch that left the project in a deep hole.  You
did a decent job on the internals of old gpsd, but I could have
swallowed a handful of excerpts from parody RFCs and *puked* a better
protocol design than you left me to deal with.

That means you, of all people in the world, are in no position to be
hyper-critical about the things I had to do to dig out of that hole
and the painful compromises the process forced on me.  I've tried to be
respectful of you as the project's founder, but considering the number
of late nights I have spent wrestling with the consequences of that awful
design, I am not going to tolerate any shit from you about me being
&quot;dead set on crippling&quot; anything.

If there's going to be any &quot;you&quot; in the &quot;we&quot; that fixes this, you'd
better start by apologizing for being rude, thoughtless, and arrogant.
Otherwise you can just fuck off. It's not like you've been much use
around here for the last six years, and I don't need snotty attitude
spewed at me when I'm trying to get work done.
