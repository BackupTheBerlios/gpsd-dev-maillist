Let's get the technical stuff out of the way before I respond to your message.

A gpsd user contacted me with a problem. He was using tangogps with gpsd.
The application seemed to connect to the daemon alright, but nothing ever
happened. He assumed his gps was broken.

Turned out his hardware was alright, but Tangogps and gpsd were using
incompatible protocols. 

It would have been better to refuse the connection than keeping the client
hanging.

That could have been accomplished many ways. Simply putting the new
protocol on a new service port would have solved the problem.

This has nothing to do with backwards compatibility. Just with decent design.


If your users benefit had ever been on your mind you could have accomplished
backwards compatibility by just forking gpsd into gpsd-old on the known service
port, and putting gpsd on a new service port. You could have dropped maintenance
on gpsd-old immediately, telling people to go with the new protocol instead of
asking for new features/bug-fixes in the old.


This is the extend of my issue before you lost your marbles.

Oh goody! That's going to be so much fun.

Let me start pointing out the obvious before we come to the good part.
You pointing your finger at me makes three more pointing back at you,
and one at Ghod (whoever that is).

I never held a gun to your head to take the gpsd project. You called me.
Gpsd was open source a decade before you came along. Why did you
take it on after having access to the source for years? If it was so deficient
why not just roll your own?

Second best point: When you took over gpsd had around 8 alpha commands?
Not real sure, but what I am sure of is that I encouraged you to change the protocol
early on, because I knew it would not support what you wanted to do with it.
You are the person who exhausted the name space adding features, not fixing
the infrastructure. Sorry dude, that shit happened on your watch.
You can just check this mailing list. It is all here. No opinion, no guessing, just
facts.

Now the best point: Version reporting was the very first feature of gpsd. It has been
there since version 0.1 was committed to cvs. I have the archive to prove it.
It was there until you removed it when you switched to the json interface.
Anybody who has used gpsds telnet interface directly has seen it countless times.
That you are too stupid to use it is your fault.

&quot;Ghod, the crap I&quot; get from morons like you!

&gt;<i> But even that would only ensure graceful degradation unless we kept
</I>&gt;<i> both protocol engines (and a significant amount of otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary dispatcher code) around forever.  Which means our users
</I>&gt;<i> would *pay* for both protocol engines (and the extra code) forever, in
</I>&gt;<i> wasted resources and in a higher defect rate. That's fundamental; the
</I>&gt;<i> separate-ports thing is really a red herring.
</I>
What does that even mean? &quot;That's fundamental&quot;?

Last time I looked a decent Json parser was more complex than an xml
parser, dwarfing the LOC of the old protocol.

...
&gt;<i> There came a point at which I judged a clean break and some short-tern
</I>&gt;<i> pain had become a better solution than encouraging users to continue to
</I>&gt;<i> depend on old features slowly bitrotting and spawning bugs.  And that
</I>&gt;<i> judgment was not made lightly.  I've been struggling with these
</I>&gt;<i> tradeoffs since the first NG design sketch in 2006.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I have been here all the time. You have never ask me to help you in your
struggle. Instead you have made bad decisions all the time without soliciting
help here.

In closing:
I designed gpsd for a very narrow purpose. It served that purpose very well when
you took over. You chose to take gpsd where it never was supposed to go, and then
whine about its unsuitability to the task. Now you want to blame me for that?

I don't know what medication you are on, but it's not working. The side effects
are terrible. It's making you stupid.
