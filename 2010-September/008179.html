<PRE>Olivier Cornu &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">o.cornu at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Notice my suspicion of the two problems being related was surrounded
</I>&gt;<i> with several conditionals. It did not mean to be offensive in any way,
</I>&gt;<i> and if it has been i apologize about it. Fwiw, let me say it straight:
</I>&gt;<i> i of course agree it could be a distinct bug.
</I>
Oh, no worries.  I wasn't offended.
 
&gt;<i> In fact, i believe we have no evidence this heisenbug ever occurred in
</I>&gt;<i> a USB context.
</I>
You're right.  However...the data paths for USB and Bluetooth serial devices 
don't differ significantly. Once a device is opened, it's basically all the 
same logic, whether it's serial, Bluetooth, USB, TCP, or UDP. (Until yesterday
there was a minor exception for UDP.)

Therefore, one of two things is going on.  Either the logic to open
the Bluetooth device is defective in some subtle way, or there's a
timing-dependent bug that affects all source device types.  In the
latter case, I would expect USB devices to trigger it occasionally.  That's
why I thought Greg's report was significant.
 
&gt;<i> What we (i) do know however, is that it shows up rather easily using
</I>&gt;<i> bluetooth, for example running the Java mobile example code i provided
</I>&gt;<i> above.
</I>
I believe you.  I just doon't know what it means yet.

&gt;<i> It's unfortunate we do not have a simpler test, but at least we have
</I>&gt;<i> one: i can tweak it as you wish for testing purposes...
</I>
I don't know what to ask for.

The only clue we seem to have right now is that turning up debugging
banishes the bug.  That does in fact suggest a timing-dependent bug
(affecting all source types) rather than a problem in the Bluetooth
device-opening logic.

In an ideal world, here's what I'd do: 

(1) Insert a hardware-level data snooper between the Bluetooth device and a 
conventional serial port.  

(2) Make gpsd reproduce the problem reading from that port.

(3) Look at the record from the snooper to see the exact timing of the
bursts of data that the Bluetooth device shipped.

(4) Build a test jig that can duplicate the timing.  Use it to
reproduce the bug.

(5) Stare at strace records until I achieve enlightenmemnt.

The steps involving the hardware snooper seem impractical.  But
something I *could* do, maybe, is detect when a report from a timestamped
sentence is being issues more than a half-cycle after the receipt time.  
I'll look into that.
