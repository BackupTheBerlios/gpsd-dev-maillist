<PRE>Remco Treffkorn &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">remco at rvt.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> There would have been one easy way to avoid this: different service port.
</I>
I've just posted on why I rejected this solution.

&gt;<i> The current situation is effed up. And don't _dare_ you tell me otherwise.
</I>
You want to fix it? Hop into a time machine, go back and tell your earlier
self to *add a greeting header with an embedded revision number*.  Ghod, the
crap I went through because you left that out...

But even that would only ensure graceful degradation unless we kept
both protocol engines (and a significant amount of otherwise
unnecessary dispatcher code) around forever.  Which means our users
would *pay* for both protocol engines (and the extra code) forever, in
wasted resources and in a higher defect rate. That's fundamental; the
separate-ports thing is really a red herring.

Actually, it's our long-term defect rate that worries me most of all.
I am far more concerned about that than I am about protocol transition
hassles.  Those will pass, but I am *extremely* wary of doing things
that might lock in a higher future defect rate forever. The reason I
didn't want to keep old protocol around is the same reason the daemon
no longer uses malloc()!

There came a point at which I judged a clean break and some short-tern
pain had become a better solution than encouraging users to continue to
depend on old features slowly bitrotting and spawning bugs.  And that
judgment was not made lightly.  I've been struggling with these
tradeoffs since the first NG design sketch in 2006.
