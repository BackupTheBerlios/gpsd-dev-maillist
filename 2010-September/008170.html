Then you wasted nearly a year of your life without a reason. I remember talking about
protocol promotion here on this list, inviting you to discuss the best way of doing it.

In the presence of this list, why did you labor/suffer in silence? Or did I just miss your
pleas for help?

Protocol versioning without a detection mechanism is breakage!

At the very least you should have changed the service port. Nothing magical about 2947.
That would have been a 100% reliable mechanism: &quot;no dice on 9047 (new/better protocol)?
then try 2947 (old/worse protocol)&quot;. And that would have been a cop-out, because there are
a number of ways to multiplex reliably on 2947.

Can we please fix this, or are you dead set on crippling gpsd?
