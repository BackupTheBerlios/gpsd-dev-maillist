You chose to omit the part about client server protocol mismatch.
This still needs to be fixed.

</I>
There was nothing wrong with the protocol at that time. It did what it was
designed to to. It had an escape route built in, in case you did not want
to negotiate the protocol properly, which _you_ elected not to do.
You could have totally ditched the protocol the day you did the client
lib. You decided not to. What the f do you want from me?
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Now the best point: Version reporting was the very first feature of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd. It has been there since version 0.1 was committed to cvs. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the archive to prove it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No pre-JSON version ever issued a greeting header. That meant it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't possible for a client to read a line and (a) get protocol
</I>&gt;<i> identification from the daemon, without (b) potentially losing data
</I>&gt;<i> and/or blocking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It was there until you removed it when you switched to the json interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, you're thinking of L. You have the timing wrong.  I didn't remove
</I>&gt;<i> it when I implemented JSON, I removed it *after the old protocol had been
</I>&gt;<i> deprecated* - after, in fact, client projects had *three years of loud
</I>&gt;<i> warnings* to use the client library rather than depending on
</I>&gt;<i> wire-protocol details.
</I>
No, Eric, I was not thinking of the L command. I don't even remember what that was.
And I don't care.

You did not use the built in version query because you never recognized it. You still
don't. If anybody wanting to solve that particular problem would have looked, they would
have seen it. In this instance you just did not care to look. Instead you call me stupid for
not putting it in. It was there from day one and it remained there till you removed the
protocol.

And yes, I hang out here, read almost every post and I don't go out of my way to read your
material outside this list. Sue me!

I don't expect you to run everything you do in respect to gpsd by me. I assume you know what
you are doing. Which only proves the point that I _can_ be wrong.

You have every right to be wrong, without me interfering. I have said nothing criticizing
anything you did until after you insulted me viciously. Your biggest whine being that you
can not query the gpsd version in the old protocol. This caused you years of grief. Right!

The command to query the gpsd version is simply the nul command. Everybody who ever
telneted into gpsd has issued it many times, not even thinking about it.
Just hit the enter key, and gpsd tells you what it is.
I don't know what you were looking for, but was that too simple for you?
Maybe I should have documented it, but I thought it was obvious.

I do not paint myself into a corner, even with an unremarkably simple protocol as original
gpsd. It was your arrogance and disrespect that made you think I would make such a silly
mistake.

If you need me to explain how this works let me know, but quit calling me incompetent because
you can't see it. 

The fail-safe way of versioning away from the old protocol needs about three lines of code.
Well, maybe five.

And that is not even the good way. That would have been to use a command _before_
you exhausted the name space.

In conclusion:

1. Not handling version incompatibilty between client and server explicitly is a mistake.
2. There is a simple way of handling the transition gracefully in regard of b/w compatibility.
    It's a process.
3. By simply putting the new protocol on another port _all_ of this could have been prevented.
