<PRE>Remco Treffkorn &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">remco at rvt.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I never held a gun to your head to take the gpsd project. You called me.
</I>&gt;<i> Gpsd was open source a decade before you came along. Why did you
</I>&gt;<i> take it on after having access to the source for years? If it was so deficient
</I>&gt;<i> why not just roll your own?
</I>
Because you did some good work.  The concept and internals of gpsd
were a good place to start from; it was just the application protocol
design that was terrible.  I decided I could live with that, and fix
it if necessary.  I even resolved not to complain about it, until
you exceeded my jerk tolerance.
 
&gt;<i> Now the best point: Version reporting was the very first feature of
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd. It has been there since version 0.1 was committed to cvs. I
</I>&gt;<i> have the archive to prove it.
</I>
No pre-JSON version ever issued a greeting header. That meant it
wasn't possible for a client to read a line and (a) get protocol
identification from the daemon, without (b) potentially losing data
and/or blocking.

&gt;<i> It was there until you removed it when you switched to the json interface.
</I>
Ah, you're thinking of L. You have the timing wrong.  I didn't remove
it when I implemented JSON, I removed it *after the old protocol had been
deprecated* - after, in fact, client projects had *three years of loud
warnings* to use the client library rather than depending on
wire-protocol details.

Did you wonder why I removed it?  It was that or get into a fight with the
maintainer of Kismet.  An actual customer.  This actually perfectly
illustrates my next point.

&gt;<i> &gt; But even that would only ensure graceful degradation unless we kept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both protocol engines (and a significant amount of otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unnecessary dispatcher code) around forever.  Which means our users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would *pay* for both protocol engines (and the extra code) forever, in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wasted resources and in a higher defect rate. That's fundamental; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separate-ports thing is really a red herring.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does that even mean? &quot;That's fundamental&quot;?
</I>
Reread.  The *fundamental* problem is that keeping both protocols around
increases our bug load.  Splitting them onto separate ports would not
prevent that from happening. In fact, splitting to separate ports would
have further complicated the dispatcher layer, creating still more places
for bugs to germinate.

&gt;<i> Last time I looked a decent Json parser was more complex than an xml
</I>&gt;<i> parser, dwarfing the LOC of the old protocol.
</I>
It is not the case that a JSON parser is more complex than an XML
parser.  It is possible to write a JSON parser in 300-odd lines of C,
and I did.  XML is much tricker to handle correctly, especually
without dynamic allocation of string copies in the parser; this is one
reason JSON has been displacing it for lightweight data interchange in
a lot of other places besides gpsd.

It *is* the case that a JSON parser is more complex than the old-protocol
interpreter and thus more bug-prone.  I accepted that tradeoff, reluctantly,
in order to get around the namespace limitations of the old protocol.

&gt;<i> I have been here all the time. You have never ask me to help you in your
</I>&gt;<i> struggle. Instead you have made bad decisions all the time without soliciting
</I>&gt;<i> help here.
</I>
Did you ever read the Future section of the Hacking Guide?  Or any of
the white papers that I wrote on the protocol transition?  I have been
publishing design sketches here and on the website since 2007.  I
delayed implementing a new protocol for two and a half years because I
wasn't sure I understood the tradeoffs and alternatives, and floated at
least two syntactically distinct possibilities as &quot;GPSD-NG&quot;. When I
*did* implement a design I said what I planned to do first on the dev list,
and I broadcast documentation and transition papers in all directions.

I wrote a white paper explaining the protocol transition and its
problems which has been on the website for *13 months*, and I announced
it on the lists as I always do with such things.

Not once during the design and prototype phase did you come to me with
a comment on any of those very public documents and say &quot;Eric, I have
a problem.  Why isn't this XML?&quot; or &quot;I'm concerned about the additional
complexity of a JSON parser&quot;, or &quot;Why do you say here that you want
to phase out the old protocol in 3.0?&quot;

But now, after I've put in four years of difficult design and
implementation work without a line of code or useful criticism from
you, when I have the new protocol actually in production and shipping
on an Ubuntu LTS release...*now* you tell me I've been making bad
decisions all the time.  

Where the hell were you, sleeping in a cave somewhere?

This was not my failure to ask for help, it was your failure to pay
attention when I was begging for feedback from *anyone* who was willing
to look at the problems.
