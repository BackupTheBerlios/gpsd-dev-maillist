Originally, i had a lag growing in the order of several dozen seconds
every minute. Now, i only have a constant one-tick lag, under some
conditions (it disappears when i increase logging verbosity). There's
no doubt you fixed something that hugely improved the situation.
I feel i have to say a word about it because you mention it: i don't
know/remember whether the multi-packet issue and the &quot;logfiles final
lines&quot; issue were the same (i take your word for it, though).

What happened is i noticed a similarity in both behaviors: namely, the
lagging-input pattern.
In such a situation, and when you have no other reasonable clue as to
what is wrong, i believe it's good heuristics to start where your
instinct felt something fishy; Especially when this place
coincidentally happens to be involved in the process. Yet, although
i'd love my instinct to lead me straight to problems' cores, it's
hardly always the case. :-)
Notice my suspicion of the two problems being related was surrounded
with several conditionals. It did not mean to be offensive in any way,
and if it has been i apologize about it. Fwiw, let me say it straight:
i of course agree it could be a distinct bug.

Overall, this already is a very long thread: i'd propose to
investigate the current issue in a separate one, regardless of whether
it's the same problem or not...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; It might (rightly so) sound
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like a weak argument to you, yet it's enough for me to suspect this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a core-gpsd bug (i'd love to be proven wrong).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible that it is a core bug, but if so it must be a different one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Greg Troxel tried to rteproduce this problem and failed. &#160;Clearly we
</I>&gt;<i> need better instrumentation.
</I>
As i understand it, Greg's USB issues with multi-packets were way
smaller and way less systematic than in my bluetooth case.
Seeing how dramatic the improvement was for bluetooth, it is not
surprising that the rare USB issues pretty much entirely disappeared.
Besides, considering the apparently rather vicious nature of this bug,
its not systematically showing up in a USB context is hardly a
surprise either.
In fact, i believe we have no evidence this heisenbug ever occurred in
a USB context.

What we (i) do know however, is that it shows up rather easily using
bluetooth, for example running the Java mobile example code i provided
above.
It's unfortunate we do not have a simpler test, but at least we have
one: i can tweak it as you wish for testing purposes...
Or do you mean Greg (or someone else) has tried to reproduce this bug
using that code and failed?
