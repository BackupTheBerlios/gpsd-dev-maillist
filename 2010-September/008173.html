I apologize for being rude, thoughtless, and arrogant. I did not mean to
be, but if this is how you received it a sincere apology is justified.

I have not always agreed with the decisions you have made during
your tenure, but I have always respected them. Your project, you lead.

Many years ago I have offered my help re protocol promotion on this list. It's archived.
You never took me up on it.

I follow this list religiously. I have no recollection of having seen this discussed here.

And that I am just a nitwit who does not know what he is doing does not justify you
doing something like this.

I can also do without the personal attack and name calling.

Let's just stick to observable fact:

There is breakage between old/new client/server.

There is no backward compatibility. 

There would have been one easy way to avoid this: different service port.

I am not saying that this is the best way, just refuting the argument that there
is no reliable way.

The current situation is effed up. And don't _dare_ you tell me otherwise.

Cheers,
Remco
