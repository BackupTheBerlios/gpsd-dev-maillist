<PRE>Please don't take umbrage at my comment. I think the GPSD project is
_fantastic_, and I would love to contribute something useful to 'the
cause' :) I'm particularly excited by the possibilities that GPSD
suggests in the UMPC market-space.

It's not really 'missing' anything. It's just that it seems to be at the
stage of development where it's working well, enthusiasts are polishing
the code, but there is an 'accessibility hurdle' for regular users. For
us geeks that are perfectly comfortable compiling/installing code,
there's no issue - we're good to go. But for a regular joe, that may not
be the case. Frex, I tried taking the lazy way out by installing GPSD
via yumex on Fedora 11 - epic fail. No idea what got fracked, but I
uninstalled it, and rebuilt from source - everything is hunky dory. That
kind of glitch is a stone-dead killer for ordinary users.

I actually have an n900 on order, and I fully intend to get busy on
packaging GPSD for that device (presuming the internal hardware presents
itself as a USB/Serial device to the maemo OS, and other apt caveats ;),
where it will be made available to all owners. Granted, owners of these
gadgets skew towards the technically savvy, but having a painless way to
install and take advantage of GPSD on this platform can only be a good
thing, surely.

Then we need some more attractive mobile client apps to fire up peoples'
imagination. I'm toying with a nice Flex client to provide a simple GPS
tracker/mapper via the ubiquitous browser. Whatever gets developed, it
needs to have the same iPhone-app simplicity of installation. Browse
web, select app, install, one-click and you're ready to rock.
