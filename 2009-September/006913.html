    I've tried all versions from 2.34 to 2.37 and 2.39.  2.34 builds and 
installs with no problem, and the rtld issue starts with 2.35.

    There isn't much by way of an error, the code is compiling fine. The 
following occurs when the build system begins to install the RPMs, to 
create a filesystem;

make[3]: *** [pre_export] Error 1

    Anyhow.  I'm satisfied with using 2.34 for now.  That appears to be 
the version used by Fedora 7, which I think WR 2.0 is very close to.
