<PRE>Eero Nevalainen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">eero.nevalainen at indagon.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Am I correct in that gps.py does not yet support the new JSON based format?
</I>
That's correct.  It's on my to-do list for the near future, but it might
happen faster if you hack on it.  I have at least one major piece of
architectural work still to do before I get to making gps.py JSON-aware.  

The good news is that since Python 2.6.2 has standard-library JSON support,
this is probably only about a day of work (and another half-day to write 
the unit tests).  That's why I say it might happen faster if you hack on it -
it's easy coding.

&gt;<i> I need (or should) parse also the messages GRS,GTS and GBS. How much
</I>&gt;<i> work would I have to do to get these from a NMEA log to gps.py fields?
</I>
Depends on what level you do it at.  The right way would be to teach
gpsd how to mine these fields, then ship the information up in the JSON,
The good news here is that I've recently written support for GBS - it's recent,
though (as in: new last week!), and needs testing. You can do that.

Looking at GRS and GST, it appears you want to get pseudorange
statistics and residuals.  Your timing on this is almost perfect.  We
don't have this capability yet, but supporting reporting of
pseudoranges was one of the two near-term functional reasons for the
JSON-based protocol (the other being AIS).

Still, it's not going to be the sort of easy project that making
gps.py JSON-aware would be.  It will probably require mods to
the NMEA driver and some new structures in gps.h.
