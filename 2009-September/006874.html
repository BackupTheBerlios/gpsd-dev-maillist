<PRE>No Bernd, that wasn't my point at all - I wasn't _blaming_ anyone,
simply highlighting that if the non-technical end-user experiences such
a failure, then the product is worthless to them...and like it or not,
the majority of baseline users will seek packages to install through the
provided &quot;add/remove software&quot; tools....saying &quot;it works just fine if
you compile it from source&quot; just doesn't cut it. It is in the GPSD
projects best interest to ensure that the various [popular]
distributions get it right. It's added hassle, for sure, but what do you
wish for GPSDs future? Geek obscurity? Or something more widely
appreciated?  I'd like to see the latter :)
