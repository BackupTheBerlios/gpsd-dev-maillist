Bump... No comments?

Am I just measuring the wrong thing?

I added a user (gpsd) which belongs to group uucp.  gpsd is compiled so 
that it then changes to this user, but also changes to group 0 (root is 
owner/group of /dev/ttyS0), this appears to mean that I don't have 
access to my gps device (perms root:uucp).  Is this expected that 
forcing effective group of 0 then eliminates my effective membership of 
any other groups that user gpsd is part of?

I appear to need a way to override the forced group perms.  Obviously I 
can maintain my own local patches, but perhaps a change would be 
accepted upstream?
