<PRE>Dan Kane &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">dan at southernkane.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Some basic requirements for this functionality:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Accept remote URL as a source datafeed
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Contact remote URL to request datafeed
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Accept remote request for datafeed
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Retransmit GPS data to remote datafeed
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> There is mention in the docs that a runtime addition to the pool of GPS
</I>&gt;<i> data sources must be perfomed by a root-privileged process. I think we
</I>&gt;<i> now have a use-case where this is problematic.
</I>
It's actually not strictly necessary that the process have root. What
*is* necessary is that it have write access to the gpsd control socket.
This way you get to use the Unix permission system to guard against
people who shouldn't be able to point gpsd at arbitrary serial
devices, possibly DOSing those devices.

The potential consequences of attackers messing with devices on the
gpsd host is also why I have several times refused requests to add a
command to the daemon's regular set to ship control strings to a
specified device.  Can you say &quot;security nightmare&quot;?

Imagine, if you will, a rival pizzeria that's a money-laundering
outfit for the Mafia. Noza Costra Pizza doesn't like competition, do
it hires a cracker to screw with Pappa Crappio's operation.  Your
design has to not give him an opening.

&gt;<i> At GPSD startup - any known remote clients can be specified...no
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While GPSD is running - an unknown set of GPSD-enabled devices could
</I>&gt;<i> request connection. As each pizza delivery driver turns on his n810/n900
</I>&gt;<i> (OK, I confess my fetish for this device....iloveitiloveitiloveit), it
</I>&gt;<i> should request a connection with PapaCrappios pizza server.
</I>
Ah, so you're saying we need a way for gpsd instances on the pizza trucks to
register themselves into the source pool of the master gpsd instance at
Papa Crappio's?  Interesting...

Your scenario also implies that there are situations where two gpsds will want
to be *mutually* slaved - might help, for example, if each pizza truck knew 
where all the others were.

My problem with this scenario is that if &quot;register me&quot; is an unsecured
operation a gpsd could be DOSed by an attacker spamming it with
registration requests.  Another issue is masquereading - Noza Costra
could register itself, then send bogus location information.

The security and authentication issues here are not unsolvable, obviously,
but the mechanisms for doing so are too heavyweight to put in gpsd itself.
I think this case would be best handled by the application suite in
the pizza trucks sending the request not through gpsd but to a tiny 
server at Pappa Crappio's that has write access to the gpsd control port.
That way, at least all the security gorp gets to live in a different
process that can specialize in that stuff.
