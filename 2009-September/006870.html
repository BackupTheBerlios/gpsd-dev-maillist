<PRE>Thanks for giving me some good food for thought, Mike, it is
appreciated :)

Obviously, I'm looking at your &quot;sensors&quot; layer and wondering how GPS
devices can be virtualized. GPSD already handles multiple local devices,
so it can be said that there is architectural support for the concept of
a one-to-many relationship between GPSD and devices, respectively. All I
am proposing is that these multiple physical links could be
'virtualized'. Maybe there's no mileage in it, but I think it's worth
considering.

A company deploying thousands of devices is unlikely to be using GPSD,
period, regardless of my proposal. This is no slur on GPSD, but a
recognition that it, and surrounding software, just aren't ready for
that kind of prime-time use. This will change. For now, I'm sure they'll
contract with Verizon or any number of other big-time providers to meet
their needs. In the future, even if they deploy thousands of _one_
device, the advantage of using GPSD is that future changes to deployed
devices (eg. switching manufacturer) should be transparent to
higher-layer software. This may not be the case if they use proprietary
interfaces to manage their devices.

More thanks to you for yet another useful pointer - I had not heard of
SensorML. I'm beginning to get that &quot;can of worms&quot; feeling ;)
