<PRE>I assure you I am intimately aware of how open source 'works' and have
the grey beard to prove it :)

There is nothing magical about open source software that prevents you
from taking a proactive role in the distribution of a project. True, you
can't really 'forbid' anyone from packaging it, but you certainly can
request that they stop distributing it until they get it right, and/or
work with them to fix the problem. If they don't respect your
intentions, you can make a point of bringing attention to their poor
standards on the project homepage, if necessary.

Just because a project is open source and 'out there' that doesn't mean
you can get lazy and be derelict in your care and attention to detail.
The distributor is almost irrelevant in comparison to the negative
attention that can be drawn to a misconfigured package.

You can say &quot;it's not my fault&quot; or &quot;blame Fedora&quot; until you're blue in
the face - the user will only be thinking &quot;this software sucks&quot;...as
'unfair' as that may seem.

Perhaps there's a lesson to be learned here ;)
