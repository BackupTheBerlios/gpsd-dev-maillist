The reason &quot;why&quot; this is useful is that serial to usb adaptors are right 
now fairly generic devices and used in all kinds of odd places 
(especially the PL2303... sigh...)  So my situation is I have an 
embedded device (on a boat) which will be connected to lots of them and 
I expect anything up to all three of the following to be connected at 
various times (or all at once)

- generic pl2303 s2usb connected to some NMEA talker with a gps on it
- generic BU-353 gps (which just looks like a pl2303 to udev)
- generic pl2303 s2usb with a satellite telephone on the end of it 
(looks like a standard AT modem)

I have to assume that people will be foolish enough to swap these around 
from time to time, especially 1) and 3) above where you can even leave 
the s2usb connected and unplug the serial cables and swap them around 
(sigh...)

About the best I can reasonably do is simply scan any new serial devices 
and try to guess what kind of device we have got (sounds a lot like gpsd 
so far except it's slightly more generic in that I need to also spot AT 
modems).  Once I figure out the type of device I will need to either:

- Add it to my gpsd instance if it's a gps
- Configure it as a dialup device if it's a modem

Whilst gpsd has no reason to care about modems, there does seem to be a 
huge overlap with what it already does and the desired end goal. I had 
suggested making it a standalone utility because otherwise interfacing 
with whatever happens after it's identified as a modem becomes a case of 
log watching (not ideal on an embedded device).  However, most of the 
code to probe a serial port for interesting output seems already in gpsd 
and all I really need is a kind of &quot;does it say &quot;OK&quot; when I say &quot;AT&quot; to 
it&quot; test added

I hope the logic of what I am attempting is sensible even if it's not 
something you will be using yourself tomorrow...  Serial connected 
modems are still somewhat common in certain markets

Grateful for any thoughts

Ed W
