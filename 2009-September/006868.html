Dear all,

I have a question concerning the interpretation of a specific packet  
in the SiRF binary protocol.

It has little to do with gpsd, but I don't know of a place where I  
could expect to find more experts than here. If there is, I'd  
appreciate a pointer...


My question concerns the SiRF binary protocol, message type 8. This  
message contains GPS &quot;subframes&quot;: the raw data dat is emitted by GPS  
satellites at 50 bytes-per-second. For each satellite in view, my  
little SiRFstar III USB receiver emits a packet every six seconds,  
containing data for a 300-bit &quot;subframe&quot;.

Below are some sample packets I collected yesterday:

  TTT 2009-09-18 19:37:15.309816 packet: a0 a2 00 2b 08 06 12 22 c2 0d  
11 57 ae 12 28 13 c3 7f 0a 83 c2 2e e8 3f 50 00 0f d7 bc c6 43 c4 8a  
8c ea ba cf cd e7 f0 cf f6 53 ca 7f fd 30 14 d4 b0 b3

What you see here is:

   a0 a2: packet header
   00 2b: payload length (43 bytes)
   08   : first payload byte: message ID
   06   : receiver channel number
   12   : Satellite ID (&quot;SV&quot;)
   22 c2 ..... 40 bytes --&gt; 10 &quot;longwords&quot; of data
   14 d4: checksum
   b0 b3: packet trailer

My question is that I am puzzled by the interpretation of the data.  
The documentation states that I should see 10 longs worth of data,  
each representing 30 bits of satellite data (thus, 10 longwords would  
indeed contain 10x30 = 300 bits of data, for six seconds)

However, if I list the data as longwords, I see this:

22c20d11
57ae1228
13c37f0a
83c22ee8
3f50000f
d7bcc643
c48a8cea
bacfcde7
f0cff653
ca7ffd30

For the first word, things look fine: we should be seeing a 30-bit TLM  
word, consisting of a preamble &quot;10001011&quot;, followed by 16 reserved  
bits, and a 6-bit checksum. That looks ok.

However, the second word is already strange: the two most significant  
bits are not zero. Furthermore, this second word of each subframe has  
two upward counters, and they seem to be counting /down/ for  
subsequent subframes. What seems to happen is that part of the word is  
inverted (then, these counters behave as expected), and I can find no  
mention of this anywhere in the documentation.

For the following words, more strangeness: Sometimes all 32 bits of  
the words are used, where I would expect just 30 bits of data.

In short, I have no clue as to what is going on here, and I would  
appreciate any hints at what I am seeing here.

If anyone wants to look at more data: <A HREF="http://wopr.jigsaw.nl/sat12.txt.">http://wopr.jigsaw.nl/sat12.txt.</A>  
This file contains 800+ records of a single satellite, with 6-second  
intervals (and none missing).


best regards,

   Sidney
