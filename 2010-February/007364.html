<PRE>I switched to 2.90 and switched to the new stream/poll method. To force the
data to continue to stream, I set the mask in stream to
WATCH_ENABLE|WATCH_OLDSTYLE|WATCH_NMEA. Without WATCH_NMEA, I hang in the
poll until a fix is received. With it, I continue but the poll returns the
last data that was received. It would seem to me that I should be getting
continuous updates on fix and location even if fix is lost. The strings are
still coming in.  I absolutely need to know as soon as possible when fix is
lost on the GPS and when a fix is reestablished. Has anyone else run into
this?
