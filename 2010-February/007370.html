<PRE>Short version: there is no way for you to request the gps to power off.

Longer version: at least not with gpsd. Also &quot;the gps&quot; is a uselessly
vague description. If we knew what chipset and firmware you're
planning on using, we can tell you if we've heard of any power saving
features. Not all chips, modules or firmwares can do this; some
receivers assume that they get to run 24/7, some receivers have a
command in their protocol to control power saving, and some modules
are shipped with intentionally crippled/stripped-down firmware.

I'm going to disagree with Eric and assert that most GPSes do not do
any sort of serial-line controlled power saving. At least, none of the
OEM boards and modules I'm using do. Power them up, they start
computing fixes whether or not there's anything attached to the serial
port. Many consumer modules are read-only. They have power, TX and
ground. Perhaps the USB-serial controller might go into low power
mode, but not the GPS core. I'd suggest setting up a test harness
where you can measure the current draw of the device with and without
an active consumer of data - I got a shiny new penny that says it
won't make any difference.[*]

If you're looking for privacy controls, you can bind gpsd to localhost
so remote clients can't connect to it. Or block TCP connections to
127.0.0.1:2947 and only allow connections via a properly permitted
unix domain socket. It might be interesting to think about how to add
some sort of authorization token to the protocol so unauthorized local
clients can't query... just a random, before-coffee idea.

[*] says the guy who's working on an embedded project where a 3uA
saving is something to get excited about.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, most GPSses will go into a low-power mode when their serial device is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not opened for reading. &#160;gpsd encourages this by not keeping devices open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no client is requesting fixes. &#160;So it's already doing as well as you could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a xwitch; you get maximum power economy automatically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So there is no way to force gpsd to close the serial device even when
</I>&gt;<i> clients are requesting a fix? &#160;The use-case I am seeing the need for this
</I>&gt;<i> is in the case of a handset where a background application is requesting a
</I>&gt;<i> fix and the user has no way of shutting it off. &#160;Or wants a one-touch way
</I>&gt;<i> of turning off gps without having to close every application that may be
</I>&gt;<i> possibly using gps. &#160;There are many cases where the user may want to turn
</I>&gt;<i> off gps either for paranoia reasons or to save battery life.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
