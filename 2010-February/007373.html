<PRE>Del &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">del at babel.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Well I would say II rather than SEATALK.  The sentences we're
</I>&gt;<i> talking about aren't specific to Seatalk, but they do appear in
</I>&gt;<i> roughly equivalent forms on both the Seatalk NMEA gateway and the
</I>&gt;<i> TackTick NMEA gateway, as well as in a slightly different form on
</I>&gt;<i> the Micromux NMEA mux.  I have friends around the area here who have
</I>&gt;<i> various different NMEA muxes, I can go sniff those and see what they
</I>&gt;<i> emit as well.
</I>
Good.

&gt;<i> One warning that I am a sailboat owner and I'm going to draft up
</I>&gt;<i> support for those sentences and data types that are of interest to a
</I>&gt;<i> sailboat. In particular that includes wind, current &amp; depth data but
</I>&gt;<i> excludes stuff like fuel levels and cavitation which might be of
</I>&gt;<i> interest on a stinkboat.  So the best I can probably offer is a 70%
</I>&gt;<i> solution to the marine requirements.  However I do have a good
</I>&gt;<i> friend nearby here who has a recent model cruiser with the Northstar
</I>&gt;<i> instrumentation set, I'll ask him if he has a NMEA gateway on board.
</I>
That's a good start.

&gt;<i> Also, once again, this isn't about Seatalk.  Seatalk is a very
</I>&gt;<i> specific protocol, it runs over 3 wires with a 12V carrier wire, a
</I>&gt;<i> ground wire and a signal wire.  I have no idea about the protocol on
</I>&gt;<i> the signal wire, it's a closely guarded secret, however I do know if
</I>&gt;<i> you plug it into a PC's serial port you will most likely make all of
</I>&gt;<i> the magic smoke leak out.  This is about generic NMEA, in particular
</I>&gt;<i> II devices, of which the Seatalk to NMEA gateway is one, and the
</I>&gt;<i> TackTick NMEA gateway is another.
</I>
Maybe not so closely guarded.  There's a description of the signal levels,
encoding, and datagram here:
