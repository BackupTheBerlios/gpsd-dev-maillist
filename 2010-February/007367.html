<PRE>
Hi,

I have really no idea where to start with this, so I'll start at the 
beginning and work downwards.  Apologies in advance if this is overly long.

I have spent a bit of time reading through the mailing lists, source 
code of both gpsd and opencpn (which I use on board a sailing vessel) 
and the various documentation.  I have seen a couple of discussions on 
gpsd-users and gpsd-devel about these topics as well.

Firstly, I am interested in porting to Linux, network enabling, and gpsd 
enabling some stand-alone shipboard logging software that I have 
available.  It is written (partially written, partially being developed) 
in Java and PHP, however the logging side currently only accepts input 
from an II that's connected to a windows serial port, and hence only 
works on Windows.  I am also interested in porting to Linux some lift 
calculation software, applicable to racing yachts, that would use much 
the same data.

Side note:  An &quot;II&quot; is an integrated instrumentation device which 
usually has a GPS plugged in to it, hence the &quot;II&quot; used as a prefix in 
the NMEA sentences.  ESR's document here: 
<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/NMEA.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/NMEA.html</A> incorrectly attributes this prefix to 
the &quot;AutoHelm Seatalk system, made by Raytheon&quot; but in fact there are a 
number of different makes and manufacturers of II devices, often 
referred to as NMEA multiplexers, that use this prefix.  e.g. TackTick 
which has been discussed extensively on the gpsd-users mailing list, 
also Micromux as well as others.

Side side note: Nautech was a UK company that used to make a system for 
automatic steering on yachts known as &quot;AutoHelm&quot;.  That company was 
bought out by Raytheon, which formed the division Raymarine for this and 
other marine products.  Since 2001 Raymarine and Raytheon have been 
separate companies, after UK based Raymarine management purchased the 
business from Raytheon and later floated it on the London stock exchange 
-- Raytheon is a US company and Raymarine is now a British company. 
Raymarine now uses &quot;AutoHelm&quot; as a trademark for their autopilots.

&quot;Seatalk&quot; is an integrated communication and power system for 
instruments of various types, also developed by Raymarine.  AutoHelm 
devices can use Seatalk to communicate amongst themselves, but Seatalk 
might also be used to talk between a digital display device, an 
anemometer, hull transducer, or a compass.  Seatalk is a proprietary 
protocol and there are bidirectional NMEA to Seatalk gateways (except 
that Seatalk also carries 12V to the instruments allowing them to be 
powered over one 3 wire cable, and NMEA is essentially RS232).

&quot;Autohelm&quot; has also come to be a colloquial term amongst yachties for 
any type of electronic autopilot, which leads to odd conversations like 
&quot;I have an Autohelm&quot; -- &quot;What type?&quot; -- &quot;It's a Coursemaster&quot;. 
(Coursemaster and AutoHelm are in fact competing brands).

The software (and any logging software) needs quite a bit more 
information from the NMEA data stream than the Time/Position/Velocity 
data provided by the GPS.  In particular NMEA muxes often output things 
like water depth, temperature, velocity and heading through the water 
(VHW sentence), Log data (VLW sentence), and wind velocity (MWV and VWR 
sentences as well as others).  These can come from anemometers, hull 
transducers, etc.

The logging software basically needs this information either at a point 
in time, averaged over a few minutes, averaged over an hour, or the max 
value over an hour.  If it obtained the data at the current point in 
time only it could do the rest of the calculations internally.

The lift calculation software mostly only needs the data at a point in 
time, but needs more of it.  In particular both speed through the water 
and speed over ground are required so that the set &amp; drift can be 
calculated, as well as magnetic &amp; true headings from the magnetic 
compass as well as course over ground from the GPS.

The software currently has a java based service to store and allow 
retrieval of the most recent &amp; relevant data via an API.  I have pretty 
much decided that I will use either gpsd or something like memcached to 
store and retrieve the data, and make it available across a network.

So, firstly, a couple of philosophical questions.  This is a quote from 
Chris Kuethe on the gpsd-users mailing list a couple of years ago, when 
NMEA data from the TackTick II was being discussed:

&quot;Getting agreement from me will be difficult. I don't see a clean way
of extending the O message to handle these quantities. Our attempt at
mapping the truenorth compass into our standard PVT format is ugly to
say the least.

&quot;I'd argue that {wind,water} direction, velocity, temperature, pressure
have no place in a navigation solution. They are utterly irrelevant to
the position of the navigation set (or the phase center of its
antenna). They are, relevant in the larger context of describing the
environment when the plane crashed or the ship sank, but I consider
mixing enviromental measurements and navigation solutions to be
pollution.&quot;

Then there's this statement in section VII.1 of the hackers' guide, when 
discussing non-TPV data in the new JSON-based protocol:

&quot;A major virtue of JSON is its extensibility. There are lots of other 
things a sensor wedded to a GPS might report that don't fit the 
position-velocity-time model of the oldstyle O report. Depth of water. 
Temperature of water. Compass heading. Roll. Pitch. Yaw. We've already 
had requests to handle some of these for NMEA-emitting devices like 
magnetic compasses (which report heading via a proprietary TNTHTM 
sentence) and fish finders (which report water depth and temperature via 
NMEA DPT and MTW sentences). JSON gives a natural way to add ad-hoc 
fields, and we expect to explot that in the future.&quot;

So question 1, starter for 10 points: Are the current gpsd maintainers 
interested in having support for non-TPV data added to gpsd in its 
current incarnation or not?

If not, then I'll find a completely separate solution.  The one that I'm 
leaning towards is using something like memcached to store the currently 
available environmental data, have a protocol (built on top of 
memcached) to set and store that data, and network enabling this by 
allowing non-localhost connections in to memcached.  The limitation of 
this would be the data storage available from memcached, but for these 
applications I'm not particularly interested in the data stream, I'm 
only interested in the most recent values, or in some instances the 
value that has been obtained by averaging over the last 5 minutes or 60 
minutes.

If so, then I'll talk about the internals of gpsd and how that might be 
achieved.

In terms of protocol, as is pointed out in the hackers' guide, extending 
the gpsd protocol to support non-TPV data is simple.  Just extend the 
JSON sentences being emitted, and all is good.

In terms of the internal data structures, there appear to be a couple of 
ways to go.  The data structure containing the session data is of type 
gps_data_t defined in gps.h.  We can either extend this data structure 
to contain the other non-TPV data (the TPV data is in the component fix 
of type gps_fix_t), or we can squeeze the data in elsewhere.

What would be the best approach?

In terms of the code that extracting TPV data from NMEA sentences, there 
are about half a dozen sentences that are applicable.  Each different 
sentence type contains a separate function in driver_nmea.c to extract 
the data.  For extracting non-TPV data, there are probably 20 - 30 
sentences that are applicable.  It bothers me a little that there isn't 
a single function in driver_nmea.c to handle an arbitrary NMEA sentence, 
which then looks at a director or lookup table to find a method of 
handing each different data element.  Personally if I was designing it 
from scratch I would have taken a different approach, but that might be 
a change too far.  Thoughts?

This latter issue is the one thing that's making me lean towards having 
an external process that subscribes to the raw NMEA sentences from the 
gpsd data feed, decodes them, and stores them as necessary.  (That and 
because my java-fu and my PHP-fu are both stronger than my C-fu so I 
could almost certainly implement that faster).

However that approach has already been discussed on the gpsd-users 
mailing list, and was pointed to this: 
<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html#why_not_parse_nmea.">http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html#why_not_parse_nmea.</A>  That's an 
appropriate answer if gpsd parses all known NMEA sentences, but not if not.

(Reference: <A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=gpsd-users&amp;m=117851046304732&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=gpsd-users&amp;m=117851046304732&amp;w=2</A>).

As far as the sentences that I need to have data extracted from, here is 
a non-exhaustive set of samples.  The speeds are all zero because the 
vessel was stationary at the time:

$IIDPT,005.7,-1.2,*40

     DePTh of water, 5.7m below transducer, -1.2m transducer to keel, 
checksum.

$IIGLL,3350.679,S,15111.744,E,095113,A,A*4D

     Geographic Lat Long, 33^50.679', S, 151^11.744', E, 09:51:13 UTC, 
vAlid,
     FAA A mode, checksum.

$IIMTW,+25.5,C*3A

     Mean Temperature of Water, +25.5 degrees, C, checksum.

$IIMWV,000,R,09.2,N,A*18
$IIMWV,298,T,09.0,N,A*1F

     Mean Wind Velocity, 298 degrees, Relative/True, 9.2, kNots, vAlid, 
checksum.  Note the occasional zero response to be ignored.

$IIRMC,095119,A,3350.679,S,15111.744,E,00.0,175,170210,12,E,A*1E

     Recommended Minimum Nav information, 09:51:19 UTC, vAlid, 
33^50.679', S,
     151^11.744', E, SOG = 00.0 knots, COG 175 degrees true, 17 Feb 2010,
     12 degrees mag variation, E mag variation, FAA mode A, checksum.

$IIVHW,,,,,00.0,N,,*19

     Velocity and Heading through Water, null degrees true, null (T/M),
     null degrees magnetic, M, 00.0, kNots, null speed, Km/h, checksum.

$IIVLW,02898,N,000.0,N*58

     Distance travelled through water, 2898, Nautical miles, 0 since reset,
     Nautical miles, checksum.

$IIVWR,000,R,09.2,N,,,,*6A
$IIVWR,068,L,09.4,N,,,,*7C

     Velocity Wind Relative, 068, Left of bow, 9.4, kNots, null, M/s, null,
     Km/hr, checksum.  Note the occasional zero response to be ignored.

So, in summary, where I'm at is a crossroads between two different 
solutions involving some up front design decisions:

1. Major hacking on gpsd.
2. External gpsd client to interpret and make available the NMEA data 
that gpsd does not currently provide.
