<PRE>
&gt;&gt;<i> Side note:  An &quot;II&quot; is an integrated instrumentation device which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually has a GPS plugged in to it, hence the &quot;II&quot; used as a prefix in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the NMEA sentences.  ESR's document here: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/NMEA.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/NMEA.html</A> incorrectly attributes this prefix to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;AutoHelm Seatalk system, made by Raytheon&quot; but in fact there are a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of different makes and manufacturers of II devices, often 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> referred to as NMEA multiplexers, that use this prefix.  e.g. TackTick 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which has been discussed extensively on the gpsd-users mailing list, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also Micromux as well as others.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have just revised that 'graph to this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     II - II is emitted by the NMEA interfaces of several widely-used lines
</I>&gt;<i>     of marine-navigation electronics. One is the AutoHelm system by
</I>&gt;<i>     Raymarine; see also [SEATALK] for the native protocol of these
</I>&gt;<i>     devices.
</I>
That's a lot more accurate.

Seatalk is the native protocol of all of the Raymarine instruments, but 
is used nowhere outside of Raymarine.  Most of these manufacturers 
(Garmin, Northstar, TackTick, Coursemaster, etc) have their own closed 
protocol, of which Seatalk is just one example.  Some of those protocols 
are wired (as is Seatalk), but an increasing number (e.g. TackTick) are 
wireless.  Nearly all of them have proprietary protocol to NMEA gateway 
devices, or will have one device on the network that emits and/or 
receives NMEA 0183.

&gt;<i> Chris's response was appropriate at the time.  However, our wire protocol
</I>&gt;<i> and our design philosophy have since widened the scope of gpsd significantly.
</I>
Understood, and Chris emailed me separately.  I don't have a history 
with the gpsd project so I'm unaware of the past discussions and current 
thinking.

&gt;&gt;<i> So question 1, starter for 10 points: Are the current gpsd maintainers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested in having support for non-TPV data added to gpsd in its 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current incarnation or not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are now.  Our thinking is no longer constrained by the old protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> You arrive at an opportune moment, as we have just gotten the JSON-vased
</I>&gt;<i> protocol to an opportune state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The remaining constraint is this: because we target embedded systems, 
</I>&gt;<i> we need it to be possible to condition out support for protocols that 
</I>&gt;<i> a particular installation doesn't need.  Ths means the code to handle
</I>&gt;<i> Seatalk sentences needs to live inside #ifdef SEATALK/#endif SEATALK.
</I>
Well I would say II rather than SEATALK.  The sentences we're talking 
about aren't specific to Seatalk, but they do appear in roughly 
equivalent forms on both the Seatalk NMEA gateway and the TackTick NMEA 
gateway, as well as in a slightly different form on the Micromux NMEA 
mux.  I have friends around the area here who have various different 
NMEA muxes, I can go sniff those and see what they emit as well.

It's going to be the same set of data though, in roughly the same set of 
NMEA sentences.  If I hack up support for the ones that are in the 
Seatalk, Micromux and TackTick II devices then that would cover 80% of 
cases, and the rest can be hacked in over time.

&gt;&gt;<i> In terms of the internal data structures, there appear to be a couple of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways to go.  The data structure containing the session data is of type 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gps_data_t defined in gps.h.  We can either extend this data structure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to contain the other non-TPV data (the TPV data is in the component fix 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of type gps_fix_t), or we can squeeze the data in elsewhere.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What would be the best approach?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That depends on the number and size of the new data fields.  If they'll
</I>&gt;<i> fit in the union area of the struct, which seems likely, we'll put them there.
</I>&gt;<i> If not, that would break binary compatibility and they'd have to go in the 
</I>&gt;<i> privdata area.
</I>
I will draft up a list of fields and types.

One warning that I am a sailboat owner and I'm going to draft up support 
for those sentences and data types that are of interest to a sailboat. 
In particular that includes wind, current &amp; depth data but excludes 
stuff like fuel levels and cavitation which might be of interest on a 
stinkboat.  So the best I can probably offer is a 70% solution to the 
marine requirements.  However I do have a good friend nearby here who 
has a recent model cruiser with the Northstar instrumentation set, I'll 
ask him if he has a NMEA gateway on board.

&gt;&gt;<i> In terms of the code that extracting TPV data from NMEA sentences, there 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are about half a dozen sentences that are applicable.  Each different 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sentence type contains a separate function in driver_nmea.c to extract 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the data.  For extracting non-TPV data, there are probably 20 - 30 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sentences that are applicable.  It bothers me a little that there isn't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a single function in driver_nmea.c to handle an arbitrary NMEA sentence, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which then looks at a director or lookup table to find a method of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handing each different data element.  Personally if I was designing it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from scratch I would have taken a different approach, but that might be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a change too far.  Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not quite sure what you're advocating.  Somethuing like what you describe
</I>&gt;<i> lives near driver_nmea.c:877 in the function nmea_parse(). How would you
</I>&gt;<i> organize it differently?
</I>
I'll go take a closer look and post some code.

&gt;<i> The sentences you describe are in scope for the NMEA driver.  They're all 
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA 0183.  Thus, by having support for them in gpsd itself, it is likely
</I>&gt;<i> that we will effectively support a wider range of systems than just Seatalk.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if no one ever had to solve that problem again.
</I>
Understood.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, in summary, where I'm at is a crossroads between two different 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solutions involving some up front design decisions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Major hacking on gpsd.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. External gpsd client to interpret and make available the NMEA data 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that gpsd does not currently provide.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I invite you to do major hacking.  You may think of it as making Seatalk
</I>&gt;<i> work, but I think of it as extending our support for generic NMEA 0183.
</I>
OK, I'll start working on some patches.

Also, once again, this isn't about Seatalk.  Seatalk is a very specific 
protocol, it runs over 3 wires with a 12V carrier wire, a ground wire 
and a signal wire.  I have no idea about the protocol on the signal 
wire, it's a closely guarded secret, however I do know if you plug it 
into a PC's serial port you will most likely make all of the magic smoke 
leak out.  This is about generic NMEA, in particular II devices, of 
which the Seatalk to NMEA gateway is one, and the TackTick NMEA gateway 
is another.
