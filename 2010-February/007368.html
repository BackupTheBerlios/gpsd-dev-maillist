<PRE>Del &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">del at babel.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I have really no idea where to start with this, so I'll start at the 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning and work downwards.  Apologies in advance if this is overly long.
</I>
No apology required.  I found it extremely informative about important things
in gpsd's application area.
 
&gt;<i> Side note:  An &quot;II&quot; is an integrated instrumentation device which 
</I>&gt;<i> usually has a GPS plugged in to it, hence the &quot;II&quot; used as a prefix in 
</I>&gt;<i> the NMEA sentences.  ESR's document here: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/NMEA.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/NMEA.html</A> incorrectly attributes this prefix to 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;AutoHelm Seatalk system, made by Raytheon&quot; but in fact there are a 
</I>&gt;<i> number of different makes and manufacturers of II devices, often 
</I>&gt;<i> referred to as NMEA multiplexers, that use this prefix.  e.g. TackTick 
</I>&gt;<i> which has been discussed extensively on the gpsd-users mailing list, 
</I>&gt;<i> also Micromux as well as others.
</I>
I have just revised that 'graph to this:

    II - II is emitted by the NMEA interfaces of several widely-used lines
    of marine-navigation electronics. One is the AutoHelm system by
    Raymarine; see also [SEATALK] for the native protocol of these
    devices.

Is that correct?  Is there more that should be said?

&gt;<i> &quot;Seatalk&quot; is an integrated communication and power system for 
</I>&gt;<i> instruments of various types, also developed by Raymarine.  AutoHelm 
</I>&gt;<i> devices can use Seatalk to communicate amongst themselves, but Seatalk 
</I>&gt;<i> might also be used to talk between a digital display device, an 
</I>&gt;<i> anemometer, hull transducer, or a compass.  Seatalk is a proprietary 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol and there are bidirectional NMEA to Seatalk gateways (except 
</I>&gt;<i> that Seatalk also carries 12V to the instruments allowing them to be 
</I>&gt;<i> powered over one 3 wire cable, and NMEA is essentially RS232).
</I>
Gotcha.  I skimmed [SEATALK] and now think I understand the protocol.
It's out of scope for gpsd itself. But see below...

&gt;<i> So, firstly, a couple of philosophical questions.  This is a quote from 
</I>&gt;<i> Chris Kuethe on the gpsd-users mailing list a couple of years ago, when 
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA data from the TackTick II was being discussed:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Getting agreement from me will be difficult. I don't see a clean way
</I>&gt;<i> of extending the O message to handle these quantities. Our attempt at
</I>&gt;<i> mapping the truenorth compass into our standard PVT format is ugly to
</I>&gt;<i> say the least.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I'd argue that {wind,water} direction, velocity, temperature, pressure
</I>&gt;<i> have no place in a navigation solution. They are utterly irrelevant to
</I>&gt;<i> the position of the navigation set (or the phase center of its
</I>&gt;<i> antenna). They are, relevant in the larger context of describing the
</I>&gt;<i> environment when the plane crashed or the ship sank, but I consider
</I>&gt;<i> mixing enviromental measurements and navigation solutions to be
</I>&gt;<i> pollution.&quot;
</I>
Chris's response was appropriate at the time.  However, our wire protocol
and our design philosophy have since widened the scope of gpsd significantly.

&gt;<i> Then there's this statement in section VII.1 of the hackers' guide, when 
</I>&gt;<i> discussing non-TPV data in the new JSON-based protocol:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A major virtue of JSON is its extensibility. There are lots of other 
</I>&gt;<i> things a sensor wedded to a GPS might report that don't fit the 
</I>&gt;<i> position-velocity-time model of the oldstyle O report. Depth of water. 
</I>&gt;<i> Temperature of water. Compass heading. Roll. Pitch. Yaw. We've already 
</I>&gt;<i> had requests to handle some of these for NMEA-emitting devices like 
</I>&gt;<i> magnetic compasses (which report heading via a proprietary TNTHTM 
</I>&gt;<i> sentence) and fish finders (which report water depth and temperature via 
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA DPT and MTW sentences). JSON gives a natural way to add ad-hoc 
</I>&gt;<i> fields, and we expect to explot that in the future.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So question 1, starter for 10 points: Are the current gpsd maintainers 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in having support for non-TPV data added to gpsd in its 
</I>&gt;<i> current incarnation or not?
</I>
We are now.  Our thinking is no longer constrained by the old protocol.
You arrive at an opportune moment, as we have just gotten the JSON-vased
protocol to an opportune state.

The remaining constraint is this: because we target embedded systems, 
we need it to be possible to condition out support for protocols that 
a particular installation doesn't need.  Ths means the code to handle
Seatalk sentences needs to live inside #ifdef SEATALK/#endif SEATALK.

&gt;<i> In terms of the internal data structures, there appear to be a couple of 
</I>&gt;<i> ways to go.  The data structure containing the session data is of type 
</I>&gt;<i> gps_data_t defined in gps.h.  We can either extend this data structure 
</I>&gt;<i> to contain the other non-TPV data (the TPV data is in the component fix 
</I>&gt;<i> of type gps_fix_t), or we can squeeze the data in elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What would be the best approach?
</I>
That depends on the number and size of the new data fields.  If they'll
fit in the union area of the struct, which seems likely, we'll put them there.
If not, that would break binary compatibility and they'd have to go in the 
privdata area.
 
&gt;<i> In terms of the code that extracting TPV data from NMEA sentences, there 
</I>&gt;<i> are about half a dozen sentences that are applicable.  Each different 
</I>&gt;<i> sentence type contains a separate function in driver_nmea.c to extract 
</I>&gt;<i> the data.  For extracting non-TPV data, there are probably 20 - 30 
</I>&gt;<i> sentences that are applicable.  It bothers me a little that there isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> a single function in driver_nmea.c to handle an arbitrary NMEA sentence, 
</I>&gt;<i> which then looks at a director or lookup table to find a method of 
</I>&gt;<i> handing each different data element.  Personally if I was designing it 
</I>&gt;<i> from scratch I would have taken a different approach, but that might be 
</I>&gt;<i> a change too far.  Thoughts?
</I>
I'm not quite sure what you're advocating.  Somethuing like what you describe
lives near driver_nmea.c:877 in the function nmea_parse(). How would you
organize it differently?

&gt;<i> This latter issue is the one thing that's making me lean towards having 
</I>&gt;<i> an external process that subscribes to the raw NMEA sentences from the 
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd data feed, decodes them, and stores them as necessary.  (That and 
</I>&gt;<i> because my java-fu and my PHP-fu are both stronger than my C-fu so I 
</I>&gt;<i> could almost certainly implement that faster).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However that approach has already been discussed on the gpsd-users 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list, and was pointed to this: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html#why_not_parse_nmea.">http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html#why_not_parse_nmea.</A>  That's an 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate answer if gpsd parses all known NMEA sentences, but not if not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Reference: <A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=gpsd-users&amp;m=117851046304732&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=gpsd-users&amp;m=117851046304732&amp;w=2</A>).
</I>
The sentences you describe are in scope for the NMEA driver.  They're all 
NMEA 0183.  Thus, by having support for them in gpsd itself, it is likely
that we will effectively support a wider range of systems than just Seatalk.
It would be nice if no one ever had to solve that problem again.

&gt;<i> As far as the sentences that I need to have data extracted from, here is 
</I>&gt;<i> a non-exhaustive set of samples.  The speeds are all zero because the 
</I>&gt;<i> vessel was stationary at the time:
</I>
Yes, these all look like NMEA 0183.

&gt;<i> So, in summary, where I'm at is a crossroads between two different 
</I>&gt;<i> solutions involving some up front design decisions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Major hacking on gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. External gpsd client to interpret and make available the NMEA data 
</I>&gt;<i> that gpsd does not currently provide.
</I>
I invite you to do major hacking.  You may think of it as making Seatalk
work, but I think of it as extending our support for generic NMEA 0183.
