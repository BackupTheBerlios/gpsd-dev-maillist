<PRE>Lukasz Stelmach &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">stlman at poczta.fm</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; We have a set of rather old Bluetooth configuaration directions at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/bt.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/bt.html</A>&gt;.  Are these still necessary with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; newer Linuxes, or do we autoconfigure properly now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No. Most of those steps are (and probably will be) required, except of maybe
</I>&gt;<i> 1 through 4 as those steps are most often in the system init scripts.
</I>
Right, I'll add a note to that effect to the Bluetooth page.
 
&gt;<i> Ad. 5 You have to learn the MAC of *your* device somehow, since
</I>&gt;<i> there is no act of plugging in like in with USB.[*]
</I>
How is this handled under Mac OS X?  I'm certain they don't make 
Bluetooth users write down MACs...

&gt;<i> [*] Since there is no act of putting a plug into a socket with BT
</I>&gt;<i> devices it is not possible to run automatic detection. It is *always*
</I>&gt;<i> a computer that initiates a connection to such simple devices like
</I>&gt;<i> GPS receivers. So it has to know what it is trying to connect to.
</I>&gt;<i> All the PDAs I have seen have some interface to find and select
</I>&gt;<i> the device you would use later on.
</I>
That means, I think, that we need to write some little tool that
starts gpsd (if necessary) and pokes a command down its control 
port to tell it that it has a Bluetooth device in its pool.  For
the sake of discussion let's call it &quot;gpsattach&quot;.

&gt;<i> Ad. 6. This one seems like the hardest to overcome. And it is possible
</I>&gt;<i> not to do it if gpsd uses gnome-bluetooth or some other *heavy* GUI/dbus
</I>&gt;<i> tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ad. 7,8 You still have to declare which device you'd like to talk to, and
</I>&gt;<i> it seems inevitable for Bluetooth devices. We could this
</I>&gt;<i> if gpsd would open an AF_BLUETOOTH socket and connect to the
</I>&gt;<i> *selected* receiver instead of using /dev/rfcomm0. Using GUI/dbus
</I>&gt;<i> etc. could help but I am not a fan of those.
</I>
What is meant by the &quot;selected&quot; receiver?  I'd rather not tangle
gpsd itself up with Bluetooth implemenation details, but maybe
gpsattach could know about it.

&gt;<i> The other aspect of BT operation is that a GPS receiver is not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily on when an OS boots and the gpsd starts. That is why
</I>&gt;<i> I suggested completely to fully delay the detection step until
</I>&gt;<i> the first client connects. When some client is started that
</I>&gt;<i> is probably when a user wants to use a receiver so, in case
</I>&gt;<i> of BT, this is the moment when the receiver is probably turned on.
</I>
When you first suggested this, I thought the device type sniffing had
to be done in a separate (and previous) pass.  After thinking about it
for a while I figured out how to do it safely at client-session
allocation time.  This is now implemented in trunk.

This has the additional advantage that if the user never opens a
client session, the daemon may be activated by hotplug events 
for USB devices that might be GPSes, but will never read from them.
 
&gt;<i> I suggested the auto-configuration tool as a means of caching
</I>&gt;<i> what would be detected, which makes sense especially if gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> is able to connect via BT socket itself, because the cached
</I>&gt;<i> configuration can be assigned to a device by its MAC which
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd uses to connect. (but I won't insist on this caching
</I>&gt;<i> schema)
</I>
I didn't undestand this, sorry.
