<PRE>Lukasz Stelmach &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">stlman at poczta.fm</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> There are several ways to configure a programme:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Compiletime - there could be a configure option that determines
</I>&gt;<i> the hardcoded default and the command lines available (and visible
</I>&gt;<i> in the help message).
</I>
No.  We'll pick the *right* default, once we figure out what it is.
Much as I love the Unix tradition, I will not succumb to the Unix
disease of lazily avoiding design decisions with excessive
configurability.
 
&gt;<i> 2. Configuration file - n/a as yet (AFAIK?)
</I>
*Hell* no.  gpsd (actually, the combination of gpsd and our hotplug
scripts) is meant to be zero-configuration - to autoconfigure itself by 
doing discovery on its environment.  The second I add a config file, 
it will become two bad things:

(1) Something users have to futz with to get things working.

(2) An excuse for lazy developers to duck making autoconfiguration work.

That's why I won't do it.  Either failure would be poison; both together
would be a crash landing with no survivors.

&gt;<i> 3. Environment variable - same as above.
</I>
With the same issues.

&gt;<i> 4. Command line option
</I>
And the same issues again.  We've added exactly *one* command-line
option in the last five years (-b), and I kicked and screamed about
that, and I only swallowed it because there seems to be no way to
detect which devices are Bluetooth and might have broken firmware that
will go outright catatonic on us if we try to configure it.

You're new here, but some of our old-timers can porobably use these reminders.

&gt;<i>                                     However, as I wrote before
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd opens the device at startup, even when in &quot;wait&quot; mode, to detect
</I>&gt;<i> the receiver.
</I>
Yeah, I know.  That's needed for a couple of reasons:

(1) First, we need to know when something that looks like a GPS is not
actually one, so we avoid camping on the sucker and eating packets 
that should go elsewhere.  Like, what if it's a USB HID?  Blame the
USB standards guys for not having a GPS device class, and/or the
vendors for pumping out cheap reference designs that present the USB ID 
of a USB-to-serial chip without giving the hotplug system a frickin' clue
what's behind it.

(2) Second, we need to know what kinds of data sources are available
so we can match clients looking for GPS information to devices
providing it - or clients looking for RTCM to devices providing it, or
(soon) clients looking for AIVDM to devices providing it. 

&gt;<i>  IMHO this should be delayed until the first client
</I>&gt;<i> connects. There could be a configuration file that fully describes
</I>&gt;<i> the unit and makes the detection unnecessary. There might be a tool,
</I>&gt;<i> using the same detection code, to build such a configuration file.
</I>
No configuration file.  *Ever*.  Stupid idea, anyway, in the
age of hotplug.
