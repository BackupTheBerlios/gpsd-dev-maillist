<PRE>Hi all,

Attached are some build system patches (against svn r5509):

* pass-distcheck.patch

This patch modifies Makefile.am and setup.py so that 'make distcheck' 
passes.  This patch makes it possible to do VPATH builds (putting build 
products in a separate directory from the unpacked tarball).

Note that I have NOT tested dist-rpm.

The most awkward part of this patch is the changes to setup.py. 
Python's distutils package does not have built-in support for VPATH 
builds, which significantly complicates things.  Interestingly, Python's 
own build system supposedly supports VPATH builds even though it uses 
distutils.  Python's setup.py script subclasses several of the distutils 
packages, so the VPATH magic must happen somewhere in those hundreds of 
lines of code.  I'll investigate further when I have the time.  For now, 
the changes to setup.py are fairly minimal and should work.

The rest of the patches address issues I noticed while creating the 
above patch:

* manpages.patch

This patch makes several changes related to the man pages:
   - the man pages are now installed even if HAVE_XSLT_PROCESSOR is false
   - all man pages are built when running &quot;make dist&quot; and included in 
the resulting tarball, even if Python or rtcm104v2 are disabled
   - redundant dependency rules were deleted
   - the man pages without corresponding .xml files now have a build rule

* ac_require-fix.patch

Autoconf has a longstanding bug in AC_REQUIRE that causes out-of-order 
macro expansion problems.  This patch works around the Autoconf bug.  I 
noticed strange shell errors when running configure with 
'--disable-python', and some quick googling revealed the problem and the 
workaround.

* autogen-field-splitting.patch

This prevents autogen.sh from doing field splitting on the parameters 
passed to configure.  Before, running the following:
   $ ./autogen.sh CC=&quot;ccache gcc&quot;
would call configure like this:
   ./configure CC=ccache gcc
Notice the two separate parameters:  &quot;CC=ccache&quot; and &quot;gcc&quot;.  Now 
autogen.sh calls configure like this:
   ./configure &quot;CC=ccache gcc&quot;

* setup.py-exit-on-make-error.patch

This patch causes setup.py to exit with a non-zero return code if the 
call to make fails.

* use-correct-make-command.patch

setup.py was hardcoded to always use 'make', even if the top-level make 
was something different, like 'gmake'.  This patch causes setup.py to 
use the proper make command.

* python-dependencies.patch

This patch adds missing dependencies related to the Python modules.
