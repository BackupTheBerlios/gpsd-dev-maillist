<PRE>The normal behavior of gpsd used to be that it it did not open a GPS
device immediately on being informed of its existence.  Instead it
would wait until a client session requested fixes, at which point it
would pick a GPS from the available set and open it.

The reason for the &quot;wait&quot; behavior was battery-powered devices.  In
pre-USB days many RS232 GPSes required on-board batteries, and would
enter a low-power sleep mode unless some control signal was asserted
by device open.  It was therefore a good idea to delay device open
as long as possible, and close the device when it had no clients.

Two releases ago, ckuethe changed this behavior.  Initially he
inverted the sense of the -n flag, so the default became no-wait
with -n meaning wait.  I slapped him upside the head for this,
pointing out that it is wrong to invert the sense of a flag people
might well be using in script invocations; he swiftly perceived the
error of his ways (his change comment reads &quot;Bad hacker, no biscuit&quot;) 
but only half-reverted the change. He just *disabled* the -n option, 
leaving no-wait as the only mode.

I thought this was a mistake forreasins I'll make clear below, but in
the absence of any complaints from real users it was not one I was
prepared to tussle with ckuethe about.  I don't use a battery-powered
GPS myself, and ckuethe claimed that nowait was only solving a
pseudoproblem because powered-up GPSes only draw trivial amounts of
power anyway.

Now, however, were have a complaint from a real user.  He noticed that
the no-wait behavior is gone and doesn't like it.

Lukasz Stelmach &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">stlman at poczta.fm</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> This is still very usefull with my (and I think most) bluetooth
</I>&gt;<i> GPS units which go standby (saving a lot of power) when not used.
</I>&gt;<i> Gpsd can be started and ready to accept connections but the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> is not used until I actually want some data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO gpsd could refrain from opening the device at startup until
</I>&gt;<i> the first client connects. With such arrangement it would be possible
</I>&gt;<i> to start gpsd with a BT GPS unit turned off until I actually
</I>&gt;<i> want to use it.
</I>
This means I can no longer avoid the question of whether I need to
reverse ckuethe on this.  We have three options.

1. Decide this is a non-problem and tell Lukaz &quot;won't fix&quot;

I think this response is justified only if the power savings from
leaving a GPS device closed are in fact trivial.  This leads me to
question A:

A. Does anyone have actual data on the degree to which having a GPS
open shortens battery dwell time?  Is there a principled reason to
believe this effect is significant?

2. Restore the old behavior, defaulting to wait

-n still works to set nowait; the option logic was never removed.  I
lean towards this solution, if only for backward compatibility with
old scripts.

3. Leave the default at no-wait and create a new option to enable waiting.

This is what ckuethe wants to do.  He *hates* wait mode - he gets more
upset about this issue on IRC than I've ever seen him be about
anything else - but for reasons he has never managed to explain to me
very clearly; he just says it's &quot;confusing&quot;.  He wants no-wait to remain
the default.

This leads us to question B:

B. Ignoring history for the moment and in purely functional terms,
should gpsd default to wait or no-wait behavior?

My view is that the alternative that can silently drain a user's
device batteries to no purpose starts out with a functional strike
against it, compared to the alternative that doesn't.  (Which is why I
want better data on whether or not this is really an issue.)

My view is also that history should win if these alternatives are of
roughly equal utility.  That is, unless there is a compelling
argument for defaulting to no-wait, we should restore the old
behavior.

It seems to me that this question pits groups of gpsd users
against each other according to which use cases dominate for them. 

Group A: Users of battery-powered GPSes (which these days mostly means
Bluetooth).  They want the default that drains the battery least.

Group B: 1PPS users who run gpsd in clientless mode to assist a 
time service.  They don't want gpsd to wait on a client to connect
because there aren't going to be any clients.  For them, having to
type -n is just overhead.  ckuethe seems to be in this group.

Group C: People who run gpsd from custom scripts or launch it from
other programs. What *they* want is for default behaviors and the
meaning of command-line switches not to change.  We did them a 
real disservice, and they'll want it fixed if they notice.

I'd like some discussion from users and devs on this.  Whose use cases
should we give priority to, and why?

...Virtually never are murderers the ordinary, law-abiding people
against whom gun bans are aimed.  Almost without exception, murderers
are extreme aberrants with lifelong histories of crime, substance
abuse, psychopathology, mental retardation and/or irrational violence
against those around them, as well as other hazardous behavior, e.g.,
automobile and gun accidents.&quot;
