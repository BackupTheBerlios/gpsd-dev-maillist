No. Most of those steps are (and probably will be) required, except of maybe
1 through 4 as those steps are most often in the system init scripts.

Ad. 5 You have to learn the MAC of *your* device somehow, since
there is no act of plugging in like in with USB.[*]

Ad. 6. This one seems like the hardest to overcome. And it is possible
not to do it if gpsd uses gnome-bluetooth or some other *heavy* GUI/dbus
tools.

Ad. 7,8 You still have to declare which device you'd like to talk to, and
it seems inevitable for Bluetooth devices. We could this
if gpsd would open an AF_BLUETOOTH socket and connect to the
*selected* receiver instead of using /dev/rfcomm0. Using GUI/dbus
etc. could help but I am not a fan of those.

[*] Since there is no act of putting a plug into a socket with BT
devices it is not possible to run automatic detection. It is *always*
a computer that initiates a connection to such simple devices like
GPS receivers. So it has to know what it is trying to connect to.
All the PDAs I have seen have some interface to find and select
the device you would use later on.

The other aspect of BT operation is that a GPS receiver is not
necessarily on when an OS boots and the gpsd starts. That is why
I suggested completely to fully delay the detection step until
the first client connects. When some client is started that
is probably when a user wants to use a receiver so, in case
of BT, this is the moment when the receiver is probably turned on.

I suggested the auto-configuration tool as a means of caching
what would be detected, which makes sense especially if gpsd
is able to connect via BT socket itself, because the cached
configuration can be assigned to a device by its MAC which
gpsd uses to connect. (but I won't insist on this caching
schema)

To sum everything up. Use cases for Bluetooth devices are completely
different that for any other wired devices.
