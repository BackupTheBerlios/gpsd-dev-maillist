This whole thing seems to be a customer support issue, more than anything 
else. I have no trouble with reversing the logic, or phasing out -n while 
adding a flag with the opposite logic.

BUT since this is apparently a customer support issue, what is the impact of 
any change we make in this area? Nobody is served with just another set of 
customers confused/pissed.

Sounds to me an addition to the faq would be a better solution.

===
Q: Why does it take minutes after I start my application before I get fix 
data?

A: By default gpsd only starts the gps when a client connects to the daemon. 
The gps will take a while before it has enough data for a valid fix. If you 
don't like this behavior, just start the daemon with the -n switch. 
===

This should take care of it. There are always people who don't get it. The 
only way to get rid of them is to shoot them. Since this is not a viable 
option, we will have to live with 'em.

I am beginning to wonder if starting gpsd with -n by default is a better 
solution? Fewer people are affected by this, and people with battery operated 
gadgets tend to be more aware of power saving settings.

I am surprised that Fedora gpsd does not have a script for /etc/init.d. The 
one in the contrib directory looks like it is for another distro?
