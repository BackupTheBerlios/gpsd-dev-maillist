<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I was studying AIS for the last week or so prior to the GPSD 2.39 release,
and it has shaken up my thinking about GPSD significantly. It has come
together in my mind with some previously unrelated thoughts I'd been
having about the next-generation GPSD protocol design.

(Kurt Schwehr: because AIVDM is mixed up in this, you are specifically
invited to the discussion. I told you I'd give you a reason to get 
more involved with GPSD...)

Most of you know that we're going to have to rebuild GPSD's
request-response protocol sometime in the not too distant future.  The
problem is that commands and responses are currently single characters
and we have been running out of single characters to extend it with.  
Which is a problem, since we want to be able to query for things like 
almanacs and pseudorange data on devices that have those commands.

Syntactically, I think what we're going to end up with will look a lot
more like the generic Internet protocol.  In the following imaginary
session, -&gt; lines are commands sent to the daemon and &lt;- lines are
transmissions from it. Comments begin with #

Note that this is a far more complex session than most clients will ever
perform.  Much more usually they'll just say ?WATCH +TPV+SKY+STATUS and
be done.

# Client asks daemon what devices are available
# The response tells it there is one GPS and one RTCM3 correction source.
# Note the bare equal sign on the end of the DEVICES response; 
# this is a syntactic marker that says the following response is multi-line
# The fields in each response line are full name and service type.
-&gt; ?DEVICES
-&gt; !DEVICES=
/dev/ttyUSB0,GPS
/dev/ttyS0,RTCM3
.
#
# Client asks the GPS to identify itself.
-&gt; ?ID=/dev/ttyUSB0
# Fields in the response are: service type, protocol, subtype or
# firmware revision if available.
&lt;- !ID=/dev/ttyUSB0,GPS,SiRF,231.000.000ES-01-39
#
# Client subscribes to TPV (old O), SKY, (old Y) and STATUS (old X) reports 
# from the GPS.  Daemon confirms this is possible. 
-&gt; ?WATCH=/dev/ttyUSB0,+TPV+SKY+STATUS
&lt;- !WATCH=/dev/ttyUSB0,+TPV+SKY+STATUS
#
# Daemon begins to stream TPVs and SKYs (like our O and Y reports)
&lt;- !TPV=MID2,1119197561.890,0.005,46.498203637,7.568074350,1327.780,21.000,124.484,0.0000,0.000,0.000,?,23.56,?,3
&lt;- !SKY=MID4,1119197562.890,7:10,45,196,34,1:29,67,310,40,1:28,59,108,42,1:26,51,304,43,1:8,44,58,41,1:27,16,66,39,1:21,10,301,0,0:

&lt;- !TVP=MID2,1119197564.890,0.005,46.498215161,7.568087260,1329.321,21.000,124.484,0.0000,0.086,0.091,?,23.53,?,3
&lt;- !TVP=MID2,1119197565.890,0.005,46.498221628,7.568088976,1328.639,21.000,124.484,0.0000,0.086,0.091,?,23.56,?,3

What AIVDM is doing is changing my thinking about the scope and
semantics of the new protocol. In the past, GPSD has always been about
kinematic awareness for devices we presume to be local.  With AIVDM, it
could become an aggregator for kinematic data from remote sources as well.

So instead, now I'm imagining this:

# Client asks daemon what devices are available
# The response tells it there is one GPS, one AIS transceiver, 
# and one RTCM3 correction source. The fields are full name, 
# service type, and name tag, 
-&gt; ?DEVICES
-&gt; !DEVICES=
/dev/ttyUSB0,GPS,GPS#1
/dev/ttyUSB1,AIS,AIS#1
/dev/ttyS0,RTCM3,RTCM3#1
.
#
# Client asks the GPS to identify itself.
-&gt; ?ID=GPS#1
&lt;- !ID=GPS#1,GPS,SiRF,231.000.000ES-01-39
#
# Client subscribes to TPV, SKY, and STATUS reports from the GPS.  
# Daemon confirms this is possible. 
-&gt; ?WATCH=GPS#1,+TPV+SKY+STATUS
&lt;- !WATCH=GPS#1,+TPV+SKY+STATUS
#
# Daemon begins to stream TPVs (like our O report) and SKYs (like Y)
&lt;- !TVP=GPS#1,MID2,1119197561.890,0.005,46.498203637,7.568074350,1327.780,21.000,124.484,0.0000,0.000,0.000,?,23.56,?,3
&lt;- !SKY=GPS#1,MID4,1119197562.890,7:10,45,196,34,1:29,67,310,40,1:28,59,108,42,1:26,51,304,43,1:8,44,58,41,1:27,16,66,39,1:21,10,301,0,0:
&lt;- !TVP=GPS#1,MID2,1119197563.890,0.005,46.498208969,7.568087260,1328.596,21.000,124.484,190.3797,0.091,0.085,?,23.60,?,3
&lt;- !TVP=GPS#1,MID2,1119197564.890,0.005,46.498215161,7.568087260,1329.321,21.000,124.484,0.0000,0.086,0.091,?,23.53,?,3

#
# Client subscribes to Type 1 AIS reports.  To subscribe to all
# reports from a device, we would omit the type argument.
-&gt; ?WATCH=AIS#1,+1
&lt;- !WATCH=AIS#1,+1
#
# Daemon begins to stream AIVDM Type 1 reports
# Fields are: device, message type, timestamp, MMSI, navigation status,
# ROT, SOG, position accuracy, longitude, latitude, COG, and true heading.
!AIS=AIS#1,TYPE1,1119197565.890,371798000,0,?,12.3,1,-123.395383333,48.38163333333,224,215

Despite the apparent complexity, all of this can be achieved with
relatively little additional code.  The AIVDM driver is presently
about 600 lines of code (much of which is string tables and a dump
function) and won't get much larger; the new command parser might cost
400 lines.

In the future, if it becomes possible to gather reports from aircraft 
transponders through an AIS-like device, I can readily imagine presenting
those reports in a similar format

I'm writing about this now because I invite others to critique the protocol
design before I implement it.
