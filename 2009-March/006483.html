&gt;<i> I just pulled SVN 5418.  And tested it on my GPS-18/USB and GPS-18/LVC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both work fine for me, both giving fixes and working with NTP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Is 1PPs working?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, I have a nice solid 1PPS fix from my GPS-18/LVC.
</I>
OK, we're in state 2 (yellow) then.  I'll freeze for release next Sunday if
there are no blockers in the meantime.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Should we apply tjackson's patch?  Patch included below for reference:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> +                   if (duration &gt; 501000) {
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure what problem this patch solves.  Our problems have tended

He explains it this way in GPSD tracker bug #15297: PPS NTP interface
sets shared memory time stamps incorrectly.  URL is:
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=15297&amp;group_id=2116">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=15297&amp;group_id=2116</A>

  I noticed two issues. This is the first, the second is reported as a
  seperate bug.

  The first is that when running with a 40ms wide pps pulse I noticed in
  the ntpq output that ntpd locked to the pps output of gpsd would lock
  up with approximately a 40 ms offset wrt other time servers and that
  periodically the pps offset would jump from near zero to around 40ms
  for a short time and then return to near zero. While this only occured
  occasionally it knocked the ntp lock off a bit and added to the
  jitter.

  On looking at the code it is clear why this is
  occuring. gpsd_ppsmonitor looks for the pps signal transitions and
  then does various tests to try and work out what kind of pps signal is
  being used. My case is the 'conventional' one ie a one second period
  with shortish pulse. This case is dealt with at the end of the tests
  in gpsd_ppsmoniotr but as the code is now it will call ntpshm_pps on
  BOTH edges of the pps pulse. However the code of ntpshm_pps is correct
  only for the active edge (ie the edge simultaneous with the 1 second
  boundary). So what is happening is that when ntp looks the shared
  memory most of the time it sees the time stamp from the trailing (ie
  non-second simultaneous edge) (because of the polarity of my setup)
  and therefore locks up 40ms out. However occasionally if the timing is
  such and it looks IN BETWEEN the two edges it gets the 'correct' ttime
  stamp but since it is locked up 40ms out it sees an offset of 40ms.

  The (or at least a) solution is to add a test in gpsd_ppsmonitor (line
  216) for (duration &gt; 600000) before calling ntpshm_pps. This ensure
  ntpshm_pps is only called on the active edge. I think this works for
  either polarity of signal.

  Having implemented this my system locked to within 1ms or so of the
  other time servers and with significantly less jitter.

Does this analysis seem correct?

&gt;<i> I can't see the harm here in the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -#define PPS_MAX_OFFSET	100000		/* microseconds the PPS can 'pull' */
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +#define PPS_MAX_OFFSET	200000		/* microseconds the PPS can 'pull' */
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not get this one.  A pulse can only be 500000 microseconds from
</I>&gt;<i> the nearest second.  So even now that test does nothing.  Not sure how
</I>&gt;<i> setting this beyond that has any effect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - -#define PUT_MAX_OFFSET 500000          /* microseconds for lost lock */
</I>&gt;<i> +#define PUT_MAX_OFFSET 700000          /* microseconds for lost lock */
</I>
Explained in tracker bug #15298: ntp pps lock unreliable for certain
gps unit latencies. URL is:
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=15298&amp;group_id=2116">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=15298&amp;group_id=2116</A>

  I am using a Garmin gps18 lvc, gpsd 2.38 running on Linux Fedora Core 8.

  This is clearly a gps unit that has been used in gpsd development so
  I not quite sure why this issue hasn't been noticed before.

  I am attempting to use both the serial port based timing and the 1
  pps signal based timing.

  While looking at the debug logging (D5) in the initial timing
  acquisition phase (ie using the serial port based timing) it was
  noticed that the ntp pps shared memory was not always updated even
  though the gps unit was producing valid output and the system was
  not to far from correct lock. This meant that in some cases the
  system either never locked to the pps despite getting valid timing
  data from the gps unit, or would start to lock but then 'give up' ,
  or that it would lock up but that ntp shared memory update was
  intermitent meaning that the jitter was much higher than it needed
  to be.

  On looking at the code it is apparent what is happening.  The gps
  unit outputs the time of the previous 1pps pulse active edge
  sometime during the following second. Gpsd stores its clock(ie the
  system) time and the time from the gps unit (ie the time of the last
  1 second tick) in shared memory which gives ntpd the course time
  offset. Because of there is a systematic delay between the actual
  second tick and when the message arrives from the gps unit there is
  an offset that has to be corrected within ntp by setting a 'time1'
  offset. Note however that within gpsd when correctly locked there
  will still be an offset equal to the delay within the gps unit
  between the actual second tick and the time the gps sends the time
  message.

  If pps is being used gpsd also uses the pps signal to store a more
  accurate time offset based this.  However before it does this it
  checks within ntpshm_pps that course (ie serial based) offset is
  less than PUT_MAX_OFFSET which in 2.38 is set to 500000 or 1/2 a
  second.

  In my setup it is clear that the latency of the gps 18 lvc is not to
  far off this (this is also confirmed by the recommened ntp time1
  offset of 0.42 seconds for this gps unit). In my case the latency
  actally seemed to be closer to 0.5 seconds.

  The effect of the test in ntpshm_pps as it stands is that if the
  time between the second tick and the time when the gps unit actually
  outputs the time message is greater that 0.5 seconds no pps time
  offset is stored. This means that as the system begins to lock, gpsd
  STOPS storing the pps based time offset (just at the moment when it
  is needed!). This means that it either never locks or as in my case
  where the delay was obviously marginal locks 'intermittently'.

  I don't know whether the configuration of the gps unit can be
  altered to make the time string to be output more quickly, nothing I
  did seemed to make much difference. However I believe that
  PUT_MAX_OFFSET can be safely increased provided that PUT_MAX_OFFSET
  plus PPS_MAX_OFFSET is less than one second (otherwise there is a
  danger that the system will lock to the wrong 1 pps signal).

  I increased PUT_MAX_OFFSET to 700ms and this seemed to cure the
  problem, ie it seems that period between the actual second boundary
  and the timing message never seemed to be bigger than this.

  As a slightly secondary issue I also increased PPS_MAX_OFFSET to
  200ms since there seemed no drawback and it allows the more accurate
  pps timing to be used at an earlier stage in the lock in.

You should look at bug #15348: NTP PPS interface does not use
interlocks correctly, too.  URL is:

tjackson is on this list, so you can ask him questions if you like.
