<PRE>Matthias Urlichs &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">smurf at smurf.noris.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Eric S. Raymond:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What kind of I/O errors?  It sounds as though gpsd should perhaps *not*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; give up on just any I/O error, but retry periodically some number of times 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or over some number of seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -EIO. 
</I>
Interesting.  I could lkoop and retry on these, but that would be messy.  
I think you have a better idea below.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; How does the Bluetooth firmware know to turn back on?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> It does so periodically and watches for some client who's persistent
</I>&gt;<i> enough. It's on for long enough initially (i.e. after being turned on
</I>&gt;<i> physically) that discovery works and the initial connect won't fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It sounds like we actually have a separate issue here that needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addressed somehow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Close device; randomly delay for a bunch of seconds; retry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The -EIO may appear on open, or when reading.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The open call may also block arbitrarily long, which may be disruptive
</I>&gt;<i> for the rest of the system (if you also talk to another GPS device).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't yet tried what opening with O_NONBLOCK behaves like.
</I>&gt;<i> The most likely answer is &quot;it exposes interesting bugs&quot;.  :-/
</I>
Sadly, I agree this seems *very* likely.  Getting to the point where I feel like
cursing a blue streak whenever &quot;Bluetooth firmware&quot; is mentioned.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; We're also still in coin-flip territory.  You're a Blutooth user who wants 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nowait, Lukasz Stelmach is a Bluetooth user who wants wait behavior.  What's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a poor project lead to do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Flip a coin :-P
</I>
No, as I said...if we're in coin-flip territory we're going to revert 
to the old behavior.

&gt;<i> Actually, I don't want nowait. I can live with wait, because I start the
</I>&gt;<i> client programs immediately anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I want is nodisconnect. Or at least noimmediatedisconnect.
</I>&gt;<i> Waiting a minute before disconnecting, to see whether a client
</I>&gt;<i> connects, seems like a good compromise, esp. since these reconnect
</I>&gt;<i> problems tend to show up when reconnecting immediately, but not as
</I>&gt;<i> severely after a longer delay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A minute shouldn't unduly affect battery lifetime, yet is long enough
</I>&gt;<i> to manually restart a noncooperative client.
</I>
Good idea.  I'll look into it.
