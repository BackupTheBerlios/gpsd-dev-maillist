<PRE>Technical standards issued under proprietary terms make me angry.  I
consider it a duty to reverse-engineer them and document them from
untainted sources, for two reasons: (1) so open-source software can
use that information, and (2) because upsetting the sort of people
who promulgate proprietary &quot;standards&quot; by destroying their ability to
collect rent on them is a good deed in itself.

I'm currently engaged in trying to reverse-engineer the AIVDM
standard.  This is used by the Automatic Identification System
of marine transponders.  I'm developing an AIVDM driver for GPSD,
but I would consider cracking that standard open to be be a 
worthwhile effort even if I weren't.

My analysis is at <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/AIVDM.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/AIVDM.html</A>

It is incomplete and probably correct in spots.  I am looking
for people with knowledge of AIVDM, and/or access to the AIVDM
stndard, to help complete it.

Under the law, at least as it obtains in the U.S., anyone can tell me
things they have read about in the AIDVM standard without copyright
implications, as long as in doing so they do not reproduce more than
10 continuous words of their content in any single quote.

I am especially indicated in having more complete information on units
and scaling factors, but anywhere you see &quot;unknown&quot; needs to be filled
in.

&quot;As to the species of exercise, I advise the gun. While this gives [only]
moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence
to the mind.  Games played with the ball and others of that nature, are too
violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun,
therefore, be the constant companion to your walks.&quot;
        -- Thomas Jefferson, writing to his teenaged nephew.
