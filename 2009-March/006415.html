<PRE>The GPSD suite now has theoretical support for setting serial modes
other than 8N1, but I can't seem to actually test it here and am
requesting help.

Here's how this came about...

A few nights ago I had an interesting IRC interaction on #gpsd with a
guy trying to get data from a Trimble GPS board.  He was getting NMEA
packets with tags that didn't, according to him, look like anything
normal. When he sent me a log, what I saw was serial data that looked
like it had been damaged at the UART level - lots of doubled
characters.  He went off intending to check out his UART.

I remembered that Trimble chips have been known to send in weird modes
like 8O1 and decided it would be a good idea if the GPSD tools could
be kicked into talking on those modes.  So I did the following:

1. Extended the speed_switcher method in the driver layer to take
parity and stop-bit arguments.

2. Actually implemented parity and stop-bit setting in the SiRF, UBX, 
and Evermore drivers, working from their technical references.  I
modified all other speed-switcher methods to log a complaint and return
false when they're handed a speed/parity/stopbits combination they
can't handle.

3. Enhanced the gpsd 'B' command to take three optional arguments
setting wordlength, parity and stopbits in the same format as the
4-field B response. 

Note: Currently the word length argument is checked to make sure it's
7 or 8 but otherwise ignored; the word length is actually set as 9 -
stopbits.  I left it this way because actually storing a separate
wordlength would change a structure size and break shared-library
object compatibility on the client side.  That's not a big problem, but
I'd rather not do it for an enhancement as relatively unimportant as
this.

4. Enhanced the gpsctl -s option so that it can take not just a speed
(e.g. 4800, 9600) but a speed with optional colon-separated suffix
describing a serial mode, eg 9600:8N1, 4800:7E2, and pass those
downwards appropriately. As above, the word length argument is
checked but ignored.

5. Likewise enhanced the 's' command of gpsmon.

6. Documented all this and added warnings about the bad things that
can happen when you try to use this feature (e.g. Bluetooth and USB
devices hanging).

7. Used gdb to check that the right parameters gat passed to
speed_switcher when these new features are invoked from the various
upper levels.

The one thing I gaven't been able to do is make these new features actually
*work*.  All my test devices are SiRF/pl2303s, and they appear to get
confused when you try to set a non-8N1 mode -- data stops coming
from the device and gpsmon hangs.

My code could be subtly buggy, of course, but my suspicion is that
the pl2303/SiRF combination plain doesn't like non-8N1 modes.  So
I'm requesting help from all developers.

If you have a device with a SiRF, UBX, or Evermore chip in it, please
pull Subversion head and test both ordinary baud-rate setting and
setting baud with one or two non-standard modes - 8O1, 7E2, etc.

Finally, if you have a TSIP chipset, the point of this exercise
was to support their 8O1 mode.  Please enhance the driver and 
test that.
