Sorry, I was seeing it in the output, and now paid more attention.  But
the fix structures seem to correspond very closely to received
sentences.

&gt;&gt;<i> This may be just a cgps/xpgs issue; callbacks providing fix structures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with different components valid is more reasoable than a UI showing '2D'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> erroneously and removing the altitude from the display.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At any given time, the display is correct for the last incoming
</I>&gt;<i> sentence.  The 2D is not erroneous, it means the last sentence you saw
</I>&gt;<i> was RMC.  You can change this behavior with -j 1,
</I>
Thanks; should have read the man page more closely.

My point is that getting a fix with lat/lon and not altitude via an NMEA
sentence is not evidence that the fix is an any way &quot;2-D&quot;.  In my case
it's a 3-D fix with 7 satellites, of which only lat/lon are reported.

Without -j, the behavior that shows length of time that we have been in
a mode seems broken; it flips from 2D to 3D and doesn't count up.

I wrote a client to get position and do several things with it (send to
other processes via something like SNMP, send a position report over the
net in a funky format, etc.), and the first thing I did was merge new
data w/o deleting old, and set timeout on stale data, etc.  So it really
seems to me like that's something that should be part of libgps, done
well once and for all, merging data so we get quick updates on position
but with the previous altitude unless we get a fix status report that
says it's in 2D.  Perhaps it is and I'm missing it.
