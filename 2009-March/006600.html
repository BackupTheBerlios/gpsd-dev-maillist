<PRE>
When I originally thought about a protocol for gpsd I had a few requirements. 
I wanted it human readable for easy debugging/documentation.
It had to be easy to parse, so that resource constrained systems could cheaply 
adopt it.
I wanted it NOW, so even if it turned out not to be the best choice, there 
should be an easy way to negotiate way from it...

I am sure I had a nice way to accomplish that, but I never wrote it down, and 
in my memory several different versions exist...

When we are talking about implementing a new protocol, we are talking about 
two different problems. What the protocol should be, and how to negotiate for 
it.

Let's talk negotiation. The current protocol has exhausted the [a-z] character 
space, or nearly so.

IIRC, if you send gpsd a digit and a [cr|lf] it should respond with an error. 
This would clearly mean that this gpsd does not understand digit commands, and 
as such can not negotiate to a higher protocol.

If the answer is a digit that is &lt;= to the one sent to it, this is the chosen 
protocol version.

As long as every protocol level has another in-protocol mechanism to re-
negotiate the protocol, you can never paint yourself into a corner.

Doing it this way requires every client to support every protocol &lt;= the one 
it proposes, or else there would be client/server combinations that are 
incompatible.

Since the total number of protocols for gpsd is small (==2) that should not be 
a problem?

Cheers,
Remco
