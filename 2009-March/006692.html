<PRE>Folks, especially Gary and Eric

I see that despite some discussion and review it doesn't look like my
suggested changes got into 2.39. Just as well given that I have to confess
that I have just found another problem with one of them! I think I have
caught up now on some of the discussion, sorry I didn't respond earlier, I
didn't notice it in amongst discussion of other Garmin Serial issues.

Firstly I review the way that the 1pps locking works. I hope this helps to
explain why one of my fixes wasn't right and then helps explain the logic
for my other changes. This may be helpful for Gary in reviewing.

You may also have seen in my last email a further observation about getting
ntp to sync from GPSD alone. I think I've go to the bottom of this and later
I explain what I think is going on. This may or may not be news to you. In
the end its an ntp behaviour rather than GPSD and when you look at the ntp
documentation it does explain it, although I got there by looking at the
ntpd code and only after discovering what it did, did I look at the
documentation! I suppose that that's just being an engineer. However I
suggest below that it may be a kindness to add a pointer in the GPSD
documentation about this.

So firstly this is how I understand the ntp 1pps locking to work.

gpsd uses the serial data first and then the 1pps pulses. 1pps pulses aren't
written to the ntp shared memory until the lock is close enough so that
there can be no ambiguity as to which second the 1pps pulse refers.

The serial data timestamps are always written and give the difference
between the system clock at the time the serial data was received, and the
time in the serial data message. Simplistically you might think that when
ntp has adjusted the system clock so that this difference is zero then you
are locked. However this is not the case, because in reality there is a
delay between the actual second boundary and when the serial data arrives,
so that if ntp actually adjusted the timestamp difference to zero the the
system clock would be out by the delay. To compensate for this a fudge
factor delay is used. However this is applied IN NTP NOT GPSD (this is
important and may be a source of misunderstanding), so that when correctly
locked the apparent timestamp difference in gpsd (this is l_offset in
ntpshm_pps) is NOT zero but equal to the fudge delay which should also be
the delay between the 1pps pulse and the arrival of serial data.

In the original code ntpshm_pps calculates the difference between serial
data arrival and the system clock and only if it is within 0.5 seconds
writes the 1pps timestamp. If the 1pps to serial data delay in the gps unit
is small this may be ok but as it becomes greater than 0.5s then the system
will cease to write the 1pps timestamps as the system comes into lock. That
is, just at the moment when you need the 1pps timestamps they will
disappear. With the old code gpsd cannot solve this problem since the delay
is fixed in the gps unit and it is only ntp that knows the magic delay fudge
factor. It seemed to be that for the my Garmin GPS 18/lvc the delay was
often more that 0.5s (although usually less) so that the above effect was
seen quite often. It may be that this delay will depend on how the GPS unit
is configured so I can quite believe that this hasn't been seen in testing,
although if you Google the issue of ntp locking with gpsd I don't think I'm
the first to see unreliability.

Of course from the GPS unit's point of view serial data delays of up to a
second are logically ok since the serial data refers to the preceeding 1pps
pulse.

My initial fix was simply to up PUT_MAX_OFFSET so that the offset could be
greater. I thought that this would be ok because of the succeeding test
which checked for the 1pps offset being less that 100ms (which I put up to
200ms) and because 700ms plus 200ms was less than 1 second I thought this
would stop ambiguity. In fact this is wrong, the second test is irrelevant
in this context and because the test on l_offset takes the absolute value of
l_offset it is accepting offsets +/- 0.7s a total of 1.4s which does allow
1pps timestamps to be written when the lock is in fact a second out.

Does this mean that you can't solve the problem ie you just can't deal with
the case where the gps delay is more than 0.5s? No becuause what is not
taken into account in the current code is that you know that the serial data
is ALWAYS LATER than the correct 1pps pulse. So if the aim is that we don't
write a 1pps pulse until we know that the lock is near enough we need an
asymetrical test. We want to write the 1pps timestamps at least at +/-
PPS_MAX_OFFSET around the true lock position. Let us consider the two
extreme cases where serial data delay is zero or, say, SERIAL_DELAY. In the
zero case, when we are going to write the 1pps pulses we want l_offset to be
+/- PPS_MAX_OFFSET, in the second case we, ideally, would write 1pps
timestamps at SERIAL_DELAY +/- PPS_MAX_OFFSET. Gpsd doesn't know what the
SERIAL_DELAY is but if we test that l_offset is greater than -PPS_MAX_OFFSET
and less than (SERIAL_DELAY + PPS_MAX_OFFSET) then we cover the whole
possible range. Provided that SERIAL_DELAY + (2 * PPS_MAX_OFFSET) is less
than one second then we can be sure that there is no ambiguity about which
1pps pulse is to be used since there is only one in the valid time window.

You will see in my amended version of ntpshm.c that I have changed the test
to do this, although in order to keep to the original constant names I have
assumed that PUT_MAX_OFFSET = (SERIAL_DELAY + PPS_MAX_OFFSET).

Hope the above explanation also helps in further review of my suggested
changes. Gary, if you want further discussion about this or the other
suggested changes drop me an email.

As to the issue I explained in my previous email that I couldn't get ntp to
lock from JUST gpsd because after starting to lock ntp seemed to suddenly
reject both serial and 1pps timing, however if you had another timeserver in
the ntp configuration it seemed to be happy even though it wasn't using it
for timing!

The explaination for this is related to ntp's alogrithm for rejecting
timeservers that it thinks may be giving the wrong time 'falsetickers'. When
ntp had only gpsd time sources, what was happening as the system locked was
that ntp would be happy with first the serial time becuase that was all it
had, then when the 1pps time appeared it would be happy with that if its
time was similar to the serial data. However if there was a significnat
jitter on the serial data ntp was then presented with a difficultly it has
two clocks of equal stratum which are telling if different time. It has no
way to know which is right so it rejects BOTH. After the serial jitter has
reduced it would deicde that it could accept them again and would start
locking. However if the jitter repeats the cycle will repeat and ntp never
locks properly. If however ntp has a third clock it can effectively use
'two out of three' to decide which of the gpsd clocks to believe so it
doesn't reject the 1pps and continues to lock.

This seems to be a known issue and there is an ntp server configuration that
allows you to tell ntp which servers to believe. So if you add the 'true'
keyword in addition to the 'prefer' keyword to the 1pps server configuration
line in the ntp.conf file then the problem disappears. In fact this
particular case is discussed in ntp.conf man page under the 'true' keyword
description.

I know, of course, that one should have read the ntp documentation first but
it may be worth adding something to the section in gpsd man page where it
discusses use with ntp to point people at this. Maybe add something like the
follow at the end of the ntp section:

When using ntpd with gpsd as the only timing source and where the gps unit
has significant jitter on the serial port it may be helpful to add the
'true' keyword as well as the 'prefer' keyword to the PPS server
configuration line. This will prevent ntp from considering BOTH gspd time
sources bad if jitter occurs. See the ntpd documentation for further
information.
