Not just sirf - I'd really like to get a hold of similar kits for
ublox, fastrax, novatel, trimble... everyone, really.

As a bit of background: &quot;flash-to-ram&quot; fakes out flash flash writes
and stores them in RAM instead. If the flash process fails, or is done
incorrectly I hit the reset button and try again. I've cooked too many
receivers over the years - two or three the first week I was working
on sirfflash; I'm not really keen to keep buying consumer receivers
for what is apparently a destructive development process.

And yeah, getting access to firmware can be hard. ublox has minimal
barriers to firmware. novatel, magellan and garmin make some updates
available. A few sirf resellers are pretty lax about letting people
download firmware and others seem to be liars and cheats - globalsat
wanted to charge me $10 to reflash my bu353 with a WAAS-capable
firmware even though they were advertising that the bu353 could do
WAAS while shipping non-WAAS firmware.

Sirf is falling out of favor with me - the SS2 made carrier phase
available, the SS3 doesn't. Rumor has it that for an additional fee, a
value-added, raw measurement firmware is available. Not that it really
matters - my bu353 died and I only have one SS2 left. So this makes
sirf receivers less interesting to me. It would be nice to not have to
boot to windows every time I needed to apply a firmware update
though...

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
