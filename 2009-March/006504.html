<PRE>Martin Schaller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">martin-s at users.sourceforge.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Will the memory corruption bug in libgps be finally fixed?
</I>
Um, what memory corruption bug?  You write as though this was a
well-known problem we've been too stupid to address or refusing to
fix, but to my knowledge this is the first time you have reported it.
Nor do I see any such report from anyone else on the bug tracker.

We have a couple of recent fixes to the handling of the K command, if that's
what you're talking about.

&gt;<i> IMO libgps is a complete mess. It corrupts memory, it gives out wrong
</I>&gt;<i> coordinates if LC_ALL is set to something which uses &quot;,&quot; as decimal
</I>&gt;<i> separator (which unfortunatley many distributions do, and no, setting
</I>&gt;<i> LC_NUMERIC doesn't fix this because LC_ALL overrides LC_NUMERIC) and it
</I>&gt;<i> changes shared library versions due to its api design faster than any
</I>&gt;<i> other package (currenty version 17) making it impossible to upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> libgps without breaking every installed app that uses it.
</I>
That last is unfair.  I know, because I can check the changelogs, that
the shared-library version of libgps has not needed to be incremented
since mid-2006 at the latest.  That's nearly three years, which is as
good as most service libraries do.

We have a recent attempted fix for the locale problem, which we do
know about.  But I don't know how to test for it.  If you could
supply a recipe for reproducing it, I'd make sure it gets fixed and that a
test gets included in our normal regression tests.

&gt;<i> Currently navit uses libgps, but due to above problems I intend to drop
</I>&gt;<i> it and write our own method of accessing gpsd.
</I>
You're going to risk causing yourself some serious grief in the near
future if you do that. I've been putting it off as long as I can --
about three years now -- but we aren't going to be able to avoid
redesigning the GPSD protocol much longer. When we're forced to it,
that is rather likely to cause a flag day for anybody who is doing
their own transactions over the socket -- including you.  libgps should be
able to keep the transition painless, but only if you actually use it.

If you look at the list archives, I think you'll see that we squash bugs
pretty quickly here when we have someone who can help us reproduce them.
If you're willing to try working with us rather than simply yelling at
us, I think you will see good and rapid results.

In fact, I know that code well enough to make a guarantee -- if you give
me recipes for reproducing the bugs you have encountered, I *will* fix
them within the next week, before 2.39 ships.
