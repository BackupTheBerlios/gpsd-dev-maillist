Thanks, although it's not as excellent as I would have liked -- Greg
just informed me that the 'foo = value1 if condition else value2' syntax
appears to be a Python 2.5ism.  I'll whip up a patch to restore Python
2.4 support.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have attempted to merge these (including your updated dependencies patch) 
</I>&gt;<i> into trunk.  I could not get the very last one to apply clean; please check 
</I>&gt;<i> your tree against trunk and send whatever correction is needed.
</I>
Thanks for committing the patches!  I'll take a look at that last one.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You seem to grok Python extensions well enough that you might know how do 
</I>&gt;<i> something I have not been able to find out how to do.  Presently we 
</I>&gt;<i> have two Python modules in the distro, one of which is gpspacket.so and 
</I>&gt;<i> the other one of which is gpslib.o, an undocumented partial binding of 
</I>&gt;<i> gpsutils.c.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I'd like to do is package these so they import as gpsd.packet 
</I>&gt;<i> and gpsd.utils respectively.  Later I'd like to add more Python 
</I>&gt;<i> wrappers for other parts of libgpsd, all importing as gpsd.*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know the setup.py mechanics required to do this?
</I>
I have a basic familiarity, enough that I should be able to fumble my
way to what you want without too much trouble.  I'll try to throw
something together over the weekend.

Thanks,
Richard
