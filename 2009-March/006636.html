<PRE>Hi,

Eric S. Raymond:
&gt;<i> What kind of I/O errors?  It sounds as though gpsd should perhaps *not*
</I>&gt;<i> give up on just any I/O error, but retry periodically some number of times 
</I>&gt;<i> or over some number of seconds.
</I>
-EIO. 

&gt;<i> How does the Bluetooth firmware know to turn back on?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>It does so periodically and watches for some client who's persistent
enough. It's on for long enough initially (i.e. after being turned on
physically) that discovery works and the initial connect won't fail.

&gt;<i> It sounds like we actually have a separate issue here that needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> addressed somehow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Close device; randomly delay for a bunch of seconds; retry.

The -EIO may appear on open, or when reading.

The open call may also block arbitrarily long, which may be disruptive
for the rest of the system (if you also talk to another GPS device).

I haven't yet tried what opening with O_NONBLOCK behaves like.
The most likely answer is &quot;it exposes interesting bugs&quot;.  :-/

&gt;<i> We're also still in coin-flip territory.  You're a Blutooth user who wants 
</I>&gt;<i> nowait, Lukasz Stelmach is a Bluetooth user who wants wait behavior.  What's
</I>&gt;<i> a poor project lead to do?
</I>
Flip a coin :-P

Actually, I don't want nowait. I can live with wait, because I start the
client programs immediately anyway.

What I want is nodisconnect. Or at least noimmediatedisconnect.
Waiting a minute before disconnecting, to see whether a client
connects, seems like a good compromise, esp. since these reconnect
problems tend to show up when reconnecting immediately, but not as
severely after a longer delay.

A minute shouldn't unduly affect battery lifetime, yet is long enough
to manually restart a noncooperative client.
