<PRE>Dear All

Further testing has revealed a mistake in one of my bug fixes. Not quite
sure why this did not show up in earlier testing. I had suggested that the
the 'valid' flag in the shared memory should be cleared prior to the shared
memory interface write. I still believe this is correct. However in my
suggested bug fix I cleared the WRONG valid flag in the case of the PPS
interface. If you look at the proposed code it clears the serial data based
timestamp valid flag in both ntpshm_put AND ntpshm_pps, obviously in the
case of the PPS interface it should be clearing the PPS timestamp valid
flag.

So line 199 (in my modded version of ntpshm.c) should be

	shmTimeP-&gt;valid = 0;

NOT

	shmTime-&gt;valid = 0;

Another observation from testing that I currently don't understand. I expect
I will be able to figure it out but maybe others will already know the
answer and this would be greatly appreciated.

With the mods suggested (after correcting my mistake!) the system will lock
up reliably and accurately when compared with our network time server.
Typically within +/-100us once it has settled down. This is observed by
including the time server in the ntp configuration so that you can see the
time offset to both the GPS shared memory interface and the time server.

However if either the timeserver is removed from the ntp configuration or
ntp cannot reach it (eg by disconnecting the test machine network cable) ntp
then starts to go round a cycle where it rejects the gpsd shared memory
interface servers, uses the local clock for a while then resynchronises to
gpsd then rejects it again. It is as if although ntp is not synchronised to
the timeserver it needs it there in order to be able to use gpsd. This means
that it is not possible to synchronise ntp off gpsd alone.

Has this been observed before? Does anyone have an explanation? If not I'll
let you know what I find.

Tim
