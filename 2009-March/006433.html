I read that a while ago, but I'm coming at this from the user point of
view: the externally-observable behavior is wrong.  I see the point of
the design guidelines, but I think correctness is more important.
Avoiding malloc isn't intrinsically righteous - it's a strategy to avoid
bugs.

I know you know this, but a 2D fix is different conceptually than
reporting lat/lon (and not altitude) from a 3D fix.

It may be that since cgps is using the non-raw NMEA that it should only
pay attention to the better sentence.  And it's also possible that the
gpsd-to-client protocol shouldn't be NMEA.  I realize that huge changes
should be viewed with huge suspicion - but really I'm reporting a bug
apparent to the user.

This may be just a cgps/xpgs issue; callbacks providing fix structures
with different components valid is more reasoable than a UI showing '2D'
erroneously and removing the altitude from the display.  If we are
expecting users of the library to do this kind of processing, then cgps
should do it as an example.  If it's too hard or unreasonable, that's
telling us something.
