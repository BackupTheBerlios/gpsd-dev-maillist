<PRE>Hi,

I have reported it nearly a year ago. But you got my report already I
have seen. It was quite hard to find, because the application crashed at
locations totally unrelated to libgps.

</I>
Ok, I take it back. Mid 2006 is a good time frame. It is just a bit
frustrating. We are doing nightly builds of navit for various platforms.
We need 2 versions for windows: One for win32 and one for arm wince,
which covers most windows installations. We need n versions for linux,
and even they break regularily. And one of the most frequent reasons was
a libgps version change.
But the changes could have been avoided if the struct gps_data_t would
have been made opaque to the user and accessor functions would have been
used instead.
Apart from that there is another annoyance: The location of the members
of struct gps_data_t starting with gps_device is dependant on configure
parameters which are not available to the libgps user. That means if
--enable-oceanserver or --enable-tnt is used, the client gets the wrong
location and corrupt data. This especially affects gps_fd which is
needed to call gps_poll efficiently.

&gt;<i> We have a recent attempted fix for the locale problem, which we do
</I>&gt;<i> know about.  But I don't know how to test for it.  If you could
</I>&gt;<i> supply a recipe for reproducing it, I'd make sure it gets fixed and that a

</I>
Ok, I will provide one tomorrow.
An easy fix would be to do a setlocale(LC_ALL,&quot;C&quot;). But this will
override the language settings meaning that the application is in
english only.
Best would be to avoid sscanf and parse the numbers directly.
Since we also have that problems at other locations in navit we use
g_ascii_strtod from glib, but I guess that isn't an option for libgps.
Maybe something similar could be implemented there.

&gt;<i> &gt; Currently navit uses libgps, but due to above problems I intend to drop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it and write our own method of accessing gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're going to risk causing yourself some serious grief in the near
</I>&gt;<i> future if you do that. I've been putting it off as long as I can --
</I>&gt;<i> about three years now -- but we aren't going to be able to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> redesigning the GPSD protocol much longer. When we're forced to it,
</I>&gt;<i> that is rather likely to cause a flag day for anybody who is doing
</I>&gt;<i> their own transactions over the socket -- including you.  libgps should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to keep the transition painless, but only if you actually use it.
</I>
I would like to use it, but unfortunately it is a significant
contributor to bug reports for us. And usually it takes some time what
problem in particular exists.
Quote from our irc channel:
yeah.. it wrote &quot;navit:main_init:Warning: LC_ALL is set, this might lead
to problems&quot; but i didn't expect problems in gps position ;)

&gt;<i> In fact, I know that code well enough to make a guarantee -- if you give
</I>&gt;<i> me recipes for reproducing the bugs you have encountered, I *will* fix
</I>&gt;<i> them within the next week, before 2.39 ships.
</I>
Ok, thank you. I will provide one tomorrow for the LC_ALL problem.

Best regards,

Martin Schaller
