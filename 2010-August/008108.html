<PRE>Hello all,
    I previously sent this email to the users mailing list but perhaps I
should have sent it along to this list in the first place. I'm trying to
write a very simple Java client to read from the gpsd port.

    I've been attempting to create a Java client to read data from gpsd
for a research project that I'm working on. It's all written in Java so
I have to use this for my client to pass the location info on into the
system.

As a starting point I had a look at a Java Client I found with a search
[1] and modified that a bit. I also had a look at the documentation [2]
and [3]. I'm using gpsd version 2.92 on an Ubuntu 10.4 machine.

My client basically polls the gpsd tcp port every 20 seconds which may
well be incorrect? Anyhow I find that my client is reading back the line:

$GPRMC,005142,V,18000.0000,N,00000.0000,W,0.0000,0.000,010407,,*11

with the &quot;V&quot; meaning that it's not a good fix and the co-ords given
wrong. My problem is that at the same time as I'm reading this line from
the gpsd port the xgps client has a good fix. Why is the xgps client
getting a fix and I'm not.

I then changed my code so that every 20 seconds when I was reading the
tcp port I first write out the &quot;?TPV;&quot; command then read back. This does
give em a fix when xgpsd doesn't have a fix. It's still tagged with the
&quot;V&quot; to suggest it's not a good fix but it does have my co-ords or what
I'd expect.

I've obviously missed something on the client writing side of things. I
assume that TPV is the way to go as opposed to simply polling the port.
Any pointers to fill the gaps in my knowledge would be gratefully received.
