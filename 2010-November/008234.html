<PRE>First in the manpage it has:

acc_x	No	numeric	X component of acceleration.
acc_y	No	numeric	Y component of acceleration.
acc_z	No	numeric	Z component of acceleration..
gyro_x	No	numeric	X component of acceleration.
gyro_y	No	numeric	Y component of acceleration.

Ought there not be a gyro_z, and shouldn't all three be in some units
like degrees per seconds (and I assume acc_* are in Gs).

Two elements missing which might be useful:

1. a pitch-track in the gps section corresponding to the vertical
angle (maybe computed from climb), basically the elevation direction.
2. Barometric pressure (raw data for altitude - there is GPS, and you
already have temperature.

I'm looking at some sensors from sparkfun.com and already have a 3
axis gyro and a baro/temp sensor that can be precise to sub-meter
resolution (if I can clean up the noise in the circuit).

This isn't the NMEA device, but IMUs and sensors would have these and
be useful (you are including water depth because that is often given
by the other sensor, I'm suggesting to make it slightly more generic
so it could be used with some DIY hardware).

Of course with json it should be extensible, but I'd thought I'd ask
now so the extra fields might be in 3.0 if it is reasonable.

I'm working on an embedded logging version of gpsd - the original is
at github.com/tz1 as minigpsd under GPLv3 - it also logs the raw data
from the GPSs and other sources to KML/KMZ files, originally it was
for my Nokia N810.  I added vehicle electronic data (OBD2 or my
harley) and sensor data from my accelerometer, and am adding my radar
detector output and other sensors.

It also uses a primitive webserver to serve HTML5 pages to do things
like a map and the satellites in view display.  Basically I want a
device that has everything as a web-app so it would work on iPhone,
Android, PCs, Macs, and anything else with basic HTML5 canvas support
without a rewrite.  <A HREF="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</A> or <A HREF="http://localhost:2947">http://localhost:2947</A>
will bring up a main status page (GET ... HTTP/1 ... is easy to find)
but that is a work in progress.

One problem is with bluetooth since they may go in and out.  I see
there is a managment socket but I will probably do something different
in my update - I'm already working on the new protocol.
