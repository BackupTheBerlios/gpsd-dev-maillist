</I>
Snap! I've not heard of any ANTARIS drivers for the mac, which leads
me to believe they're using one of the 3 popular chips. That's a Good
Thing. I was afraid they'd decided to go with the on-die usb
controller.

&gt;<i> I'm not keen on Windows either: it's good for games and not much else.  The
</I>&gt;<i> only known solution right now for pulling logs off of the device is the
</I>&gt;<i> vendor's software, which only runs on Windows.  I've been sniffing USB
</I>&gt;<i> packets off of that to determine what it's doing.
</I>
I've installed all the chipset tools for sir, trimble, ublox and itrax
on my windows side. I use them long enough to write something that
works under *NIX and then they just clutter up my disk. still, it's
sometimes nice to have vendor tools to regression test with.

&gt;<i> As tested with Mac OS X: When I plug the SkyTrx into my mac, the Mac detects
</I>&gt;<i> it and gives it a /dev entry (Which I usually ln to /dev/gps).  I can boot
</I>&gt;<i> the latest SVN GPSD with UBX support and put the SkyTrx into 'live' mode (in
</I>&gt;<i> which it reports CURRENT GPS status to the system) with no trickery or
</I>&gt;<i> hackery.  I don't have a working Linux box at home right now but I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> it will work similarly there.
</I>
Yeah, I (with lots of help from Ali and Andreas) developed the UBX
driver on OpenBSD - so there's nothing OS-specific about it. And if
there is, that's a bug. :)

&gt;<i> As for patching, the only thing as far as I can tell that needs doing is
</I>&gt;<i> figuring out :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) the magic message to tell the device to 'dump' it's log of tracking
</I>&gt;<i> b) the protocol it responds in needs decoding
</I>&gt;<i> c) Optionally, the flag to 'clear' the on-device log, as it can get filled
</I>&gt;<i> up [vendor software supports this]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the right guidance, I can puzzle a lot of this out but I may not be the
</I>&gt;<i> ideal person for this kind of hacking (eager and willing to learn, yes: well
</I>&gt;<i> educated in reading &amp; decoding USB logs &amp; hex: no).
</I>
Make friends with perl. or python. or some other text-oriented
scripting language. It's somewhat time-consuming, reading usbsnoopy
logs but not hugely difficult.

basically, you write a script that slurps in the log, breaks off one
usb packet, extracts the transaction id, and the payload, buffers it
if necessary or prints it, and repeats. And it'll be pretty obvious.
look for mu-B and print the next 10 bytes....

&gt;<i> Sorry: it's using a USB protocol bulk transfer: the underlying packets
</I>
USB ~= UBX

both have 'U' and 'B', and 'S' and 'X' sound very similar on the telephone.

&gt;<i> appear to be UBX (The UBlox proprietary) protocol (funky high-ascii pseudo-u
</I>&gt;<i> (character 230 I believe), B, ! heads all the packets, e.g. uB!) messages; I
</I>&gt;<i> have to go through and figure out what class &amp; id they're using, but when I
</I>&gt;<i> looked it appeared to be a non-documented one (e.g. vendor wrote a protocol
</I>&gt;<i> extension, which seems likely).  The bulk transfer is preceded by a single,
</I>&gt;<i> short UBX message which I also have to puzzle out.
</I>
UBX message class 0x40 - 0x4F are for user messages ... it wouldn't
surprise me in the least if that's how they chose to implement it.
Really, that would make sense.

&gt;<i> Not sure; I threw it out there figuring it may mean it would be easier to
</I>&gt;<i> intercept or decode.  I'll look into sticking a debug-enabled version of
</I>&gt;<i> libusb in, which may give me an easier log.
</I>
That might be your easiest solution. Let libusb do the hard work of
managing usb transactions, and just monitor the results of
usb_bulk_{read,write}

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
