<PRE>Sorry... I think I was half asleep when I replied last night and was
probably unclear.  It doesn't help that it's been some time since I played
with USB stuff [Lego USB drivers, ages and ages ago].. Some clarification
follows....

I'll get the major/minor versions when I'm home tonight, but it lists itself
in USB as &quot;ANTARIS(4) RECEIVER&quot; (I'm working off memory; I'll double check
the exact text when home).

It maps as a comm port: on windows it maps to COM4.  On my mac, when I
plugged it in, it got a serial port as well (I don't recall which one, I
will check tonight when I'm home).   It appears the serial-&gt;usb bridge on
the device is a fairly generic one that most OS' recognize (although you
need either a Ublox or SkyTrx driver [both work] to get it working on
Windows).

I'm not keen on Windows either: it's good for games and not much else.  The
only known solution right now for pulling logs off of the device is the
vendor's software, which only runs on Windows.  I've been sniffing USB
packets off of that to determine what it's doing.

As tested with Mac OS X: When I plug the SkyTrx into my mac, the Mac detects
it and gives it a /dev entry (Which I usually ln to /dev/gps).  I can boot
the latest SVN GPSD with UBX support and put the SkyTrx into 'live' mode (in
which it reports CURRENT GPS status to the system) with no trickery or
hackery.  I don't have a working Linux box at home right now but I suspect
it will work similarly there.

As for patching, the only thing as far as I can tell that needs doing is
figuring out :

a) the magic message to tell the device to 'dump' it's log of tracking
b) the protocol it responds in needs decoding
c) Optionally, the flag to 'clear' the on-device log, as it can get filled
up [vendor software supports this]

With the right guidance, I can puzzle a lot of this out but I may not be the
ideal person for this kind of hacking (eager and willing to learn, yes: well
educated in reading &amp; decoding USB logs &amp; hex: no).


&gt;<i> I can probably dump out the USB Snoopy logs if anyone's interested: it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appears to be speaking a combination of NMEA at first to get config info
</I>&gt;<i> off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the device, then it sends a UBX message (my reading of hex is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> rusty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the moment, but i BELIEVE it's sending a UBX config message) which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; followed by a large UBX protocol bulk transfer from the device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you mean &quot;large USB protocol bulk transfer&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's somehow attaching as a comm port, then you should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> intercept the stream. Otherwise you get to reassemble it. You might
</I>&gt;<i> want to look at gpsbabel - they use libusb for some of their drivers.
</I>

Sorry: it's using a USB protocol bulk transfer: the underlying packets
appear to be UBX (The UBlox proprietary) protocol (funky high-ascii pseudo-u
(character 230 I believe), B, ! heads all the packets, e.g. uB!) messages; I
have to go through and figure out what class &amp; id they're using, but when I
looked it appeared to be a non-documented one (e.g. vendor wrote a protocol
extension, which seems likely).  The bulk transfer is preceded by a single,
short UBX message which I also have to puzzle out.

&gt;<i> I noticed by the way that the vendors drivers are written using the win32
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version of LibUSB...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ugh. that was a fun couple of afternoons writing a decoder for
</I>&gt;<i> usbsnoopy dumps to reassemble them into the serial traffic. :( Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> you could build a win32 version of libusb with debugging... or maybe
</I>&gt;<i> the version they have is already debug-enabled?
</I>


Not sure; I threw it out there figuring it may mean it would be easier to
intercept or decode.  I'll look into sticking a debug-enabled version of
libusb in, which may give me an easier log.

I can provide dumps of a USB comm session following &quot;plug in device, ask
vendor tool to pull data [I note it uses standard NMEA to pull config and
firmware version data before pulling the data], get data, disconnect,
unplug&quot; if anyone wants them, as well as a copy of the file the tool
produces (a LAS file, which the vendor tool can later convert to google
earth if desired - I did note that the LAS file was not 100% compliant with
the spec pyLAS from code.google.com used, as I had parsing errors).

If anyone wants to point me in the right direction, that'd be great as well.

Thanks,

Brendan
