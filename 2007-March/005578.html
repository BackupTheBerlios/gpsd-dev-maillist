Replied with relevant data; hope it helps people.




&gt;<i> It maps as a comm port: on windows it maps to COM4.  On my mac, when I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plugged it in, it got a serial port as well (I don't recall which one, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will check tonight when I'm home).   It appears the serial-&gt;usb bridge
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the device is a fairly generic one that most OS' recognize (although you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need either a Ublox or SkyTrx driver [both work] to get it working on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Snap! I've not heard of any ANTARIS drivers for the mac, which leads
</I>&gt;<i> me to believe they're using one of the 3 popular chips. That's a Good
</I>&gt;<i> Thing. I was afraid they'd decided to go with the on-die usb
</I>&gt;<i> controller.
</I>

As mentioned in my other mail with data, it launches the CDCACM driver...
FYI, the device it creates in /dev/ is cu.usbmodem0000101D1

&gt;<i> I'm not keen on Windows either: it's good for games and not much
</I>&gt;<i> else.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only known solution right now for pulling logs off of the device is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vendor's software, which only runs on Windows.  I've been sniffing USB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packets off of that to determine what it's doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've installed all the chipset tools for sir, trimble, ublox and itrax
</I>&gt;<i> on my windows side. I use them long enough to write something that
</I>&gt;<i> works under *NIX and then they just clutter up my disk. still, it's
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes nice to have vendor tools to regression test with.
</I>

Yup.  Unfortunately I found that Parallels doesn't deal well with the high
CPU usage that happens during the data dump [on a dedicated machine, however
they implemented their driver i hit 80-90% cpu usage on a dual core box
while dumping data], and it locks up, so I had to clutter an actual machine
rather than a virtual disk...

&gt;<i> As tested with Mac OS X: When I plug the SkyTrx into my mac, the Mac
</I>&gt;<i> detects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it and gives it a /dev entry (Which I usually ln to /dev/gps).  I can
</I>&gt;<i> boot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the latest SVN GPSD with UBX support and put the SkyTrx into 'live' mode
</I>&gt;<i> (in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which it reports CURRENT GPS status to the system) with no trickery or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hackery.  I don't have a working Linux box at home right now but I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it will work similarly there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I (with lots of help from Ali and Andreas) developed the UBX
</I>&gt;<i> driver on OpenBSD - so there's nothing OS-specific about it. And if
</I>&gt;<i> there is, that's a bug. :)
</I>

I've got a 4U box sitting around in a spare bedroom here: trying to figure
out if I should stick OpenBSD or Linux on it: what platform is GPSd working
best on right now?


&gt;<i> As for patching, the only thing as far as I can tell that needs doing is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; figuring out :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) the magic message to tell the device to 'dump' it's log of tracking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b) the protocol it responds in needs decoding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; c) Optionally, the flag to 'clear' the on-device log, as it can get
</I>&gt;<i> filled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up [vendor software supports this]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With the right guidance, I can puzzle a lot of this out but I may not be
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ideal person for this kind of hacking (eager and willing to learn, yes:
</I>&gt;<i> well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; educated in reading &amp; decoding USB logs &amp; hex: no).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Make friends with perl. or python. or some other text-oriented
</I>&gt;<i> scripting language. It's somewhat time-consuming, reading usbsnoopy
</I>&gt;<i> logs but not hugely difficult.
</I>

Fortunately, I'm already friends with both Perl and Python.

basically, you write a script that slurps in the log, breaks off one
&gt;<i> usb packet, extracts the transaction id, and the payload, buffers it
</I>&gt;<i> if necessary or prints it, and repeats. And it'll be pretty obvious.
</I>&gt;<i> look for mu-B and print the next 10 bytes....
</I>

Already working on it.

&gt;<i> Sorry: it's using a USB protocol bulk transfer: the underlying packets
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> USB ~= UBX
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> both have 'U' and 'B', and 'S' and 'X' sound very similar on the
</I>&gt;<i> telephone.
</I>

Yes, what I meant was a USB bulk transfer, which was sending UBX messages
during.

&gt;<i> appear to be UBX (The UBlox proprietary) protocol (funky high-ascii
</I>&gt;<i> pseudo-u
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (character 230 I believe), B, ! heads all the packets, e.g. uB!)
</I>&gt;<i> messages; I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to go through and figure out what class &amp; id they're using, but
</I>&gt;<i> when I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looked it appeared to be a non-documented one (e.g. vendor wrote a
</I>&gt;<i> protocol
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extension, which seems likely).  The bulk transfer is preceded by a
</I>&gt;<i> single,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; short UBX message which I also have to puzzle out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> UBX message class 0x40 - 0x4F are for user messages ... it wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> surprise me in the least if that's how they chose to implement it.
</I>&gt;<i> Really, that would make sense.
</I>

So all I need to do is figure out what message triggers the dump, and then
it's a matter of parsing out the  response.  I don't see code in  the
current UBX driver for sending UBX messages, and I'm not too familiar yet
with gpsd's proper protocol: once I puzzle out how to trigger the dump,
what's the proper place and method for putting this code in place? (e.g. can
I send a message through GPSd from Python, which will translate into a UBX
message).

&gt;<i> Not sure; I threw it out there figuring it may mean it would be easier to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intercept or decode.  I'll look into sticking a debug-enabled version of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libusb in, which may give me an easier log.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That might be your easiest solution. Let libusb do the hard work of
</I>&gt;<i> managing usb transactions, and just monitor the results of
</I>&gt;<i> usb_bulk_{read,write}
</I>

I'll look into it.

Thanks.
