&quot;a normal usb device&quot; - what's that? a comm port, a human interface
device, a generic usb endpoint? which driver claims the device? I'm
not hugely keen on developing under windows; I prefer to work on
OpenBSD. It would be nice to know how what kind of usb-serial they're
using, given that the antaris chipset itself is USB capable. Do I need
to write a whole new ucom driver, can i patch an existing one, or will
it just work...

&gt;<i> I can probably dump out the USB Snoopy logs if anyone's interested: it

</I>&gt;<i> of the device, then it sends a UBX message (my reading of hex is a bit rusty
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment, but i BELIEVE it's sending a UBX config message) which is
</I>&gt;<i> followed by a large UBX protocol bulk transfer from the device.
</I>
you mean &quot;large USB protocol bulk transfer&quot;?

If it's somehow attaching as a comm port, then you should be able to
intercept the stream. Otherwise you get to reassemble it. You might
want to look at gpsbabel - they use libusb for some of their drivers.

&gt;<i> I noticed by the way that the vendors drivers are written using the win32
</I>&gt;<i> version of LibUSB...
</I>
ugh. that was a fun couple of afternoons writing a decoder for
usbsnoopy dumps to reassemble them into the serial traffic. :( Maybe
you could build a win32 version of libusb with debugging... or maybe
the version they have is already debug-enabled?

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
