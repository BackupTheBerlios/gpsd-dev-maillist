With all the love in my heart: RTFM.

Depending on what you're doing, you may wish to write your own polling
engine ... any scripting language with do ... and send a query to get
what you're after. the &quot;Q&quot; message which is not sent in watcher mode
will give you number of PRNs used, and DOP figures. This is the reason
why my script that generates the monitor page uses &quot;SPAMQY&quot; as a
query.

Failing that, the Y message (which is sent by watcher mode) does tell
you which ones were used in the last navigation solution. This is
documented in the manpage: &quot;... quintuples  of  satellite  PRNs,
elevation/azimuth pairs (elevation an  integer  formatted  as  %d  in
range  0-90,  azimuth an integer formatted as %d in range 0-359),
signal strengths in decibels,  and  1 or 0 according as the satellite
was or was not used in the last fix.&quot; From there, you just have to
parse the message and count the number of PRNs marked as used.

Also you could just log the raw output of my receiver with gpspipe -R
&gt;<i> file, and re-process it later.
</I>
&gt;<i> And don't worry, I will be using my own gpsd server while I get things
</I>&gt;<i> up and running :) Unfortunately the server in question isn't visible to
</I>&gt;<i> the internet, otherwise I'd be more than glad to set up a web service
</I>&gt;<i> like the one at gpsd.mainframe.cx.
</I>
If I really had a problem with people knowing where the top of an
office building is, I'd a) packet filter my gpsd, and b) ask google to
delete the imagery. If you ever do get around to making your gpsd
publicly visible, that'd be great.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
