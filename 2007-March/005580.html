<PRE>
I tested svn r4324 on NetBSD/i386 4.99.16 (-current from within days),
using a USB/serial device (Prolific PL2303) and a Garmin GPS V.

Nothing useful happened with garmin binary protocol.  This is implied
by omission in the manpage.   I can see not wanting to explain what
isn't supported.

After putting the receiver in RTCM/NMEA, I was able to get an xgps
display.

I put the non-pps server lines in ntp.conf and restarted ntpd, and
then after starting gpsd got some observations.  The time is ~600 ms
off* with:

  server 127.127.28.0 minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
  fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 0.420 refid GPS

* relative to my home server which is s3 to a NetBSD/sparc in my
  office only 10 ms away with a TrueTime XL-DC timing receiver, and
  and seems within a few ms of other stratum 1s.

So the mechanics work (yay), and NMEA-derived time on a Garmin V is
not super useful (not a surprise).

Sometimes gpsd doesn't sync up, trying lots of baud rates.

There used to be, I thought, an option to set the IP address of the
AF_INET socket.  This seems to be gone, which is a serious regression
as many will not want to publish their position to the world.  The
following patch is helpful.  Even for those that don't have black
helicopters following them, the htonl seems in order, although for
INADDR_ANY it doesn't matter.

What's up with the double conversion:
	sin.sin_port = htons(ntohs((in_port_t)pse-&gt;s_port));

It seems this must be working around some odd bug, and deserves a
comment.


When compiling via pkgsrc, the compiler is stricter and complains
about a few nits (printf format/type mismatch).  I sent Chris a note
off-list about those.

It seems real ncurses is required and NetBSD's own curses doesn't
work.  The failure is non-obvious.  I made the pkg force real ncurses.

So all in all this seems to work well; hope this is a useful test
report.
