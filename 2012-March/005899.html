<PRE>CVS-to-Arch transition was quite painful (poor documentation, overly
complex UI on the Arch end) and Arch to bzr came as something of 
a relief even though it caused transient headaches.  Have I
called that correctly?
 
&gt;<i> I have asked one of my staff to try out some of the 3g systems for us to
</I>&gt;<i> consider, and I read your descriptions with great interest.  He had used
</I>&gt;<i> hg for a project, to allow 2 or 3 people to manage (jointly) a branch
</I>&gt;<i> off the 'real' code before a critical demo.  It was ok when set up, but
</I>&gt;<i> awkward to set up and a bit counterintuitive.  (This person is both very
</I>&gt;<i> together and a programmer.)
</I>
This fails to surprise me; everything has a learning curve.  And
installation tends to be the hairy part.
 
&gt;<i> Your bias towards bzr and hg (given a switch) sounds pretty sane to me.
</I>
I'm learning a lot more; in fact I'm writing a survey paper on the
state of the VCS art -- good thing for me to be doing while Gary works
on the Garmin blockers.  Last night I had a *fascinating* IRC conversation
with Graydon Hoare, author of Monotone.  The guy knows where all the
bodies in this technical area are buried, and he has excellent taste...

So far, what I'm learning is having the effect of confirming my
initial take that Mercurial looks like the best-balanced of the lot
(Graydon actually more or less agrees with this).  And it has raised 
my evaluation of bzr from &quot;yet another 3G, ho hum&quot; to &quot;strong contender&quot;.  

But now I understand a lot more about what Mercurial *doesn't* have.
The file-tree level of its merging algorithm is weaker than Monotone's
in some well-defined ways, and Mercurial trades away some of the
integrity checking Monotone does to get better performance.  I'll
describe these issues in detail in the paper.

I may yet change my mind about both evaluations, It's possible I could
learn something in the next week that knocks Mercurial out of the top
spot.  But this is looking unlikely; it's remarkably hard to find
anyone with a serious criticism of it, and I've been *searching*.  Even
Linus Torvalds, who spewed contempt at every other non-git VCS in the
world in his Google tech talk, said Mercurial is &quot;pretty good&quot;.

&gt;<i> NetBSD still uses CVS.  The main issues are lack of people writing the
</I>&gt;<i> right code, and I don't think that CVS has anything to do with this.
</I>
No, it doesn't.  But I still think CVS's deficiencies are very serious
and warrant moving to anything else.  Heck, that was already clear in 
2003-2004.

&gt;<i> All in all, I'd say that if svn isn't causing real pain, leave well
</I>&gt;<i> enough alone.  The vc system is almost surely not the problem - it's
</I>&gt;<i> lack of *anyone* having the code we want.
</I>
I agree that lack of *anyone* having the code we want is a much larger
issue than any problems Subversion causes us,  But I think moving to one 
of the 3Gs would nevertheless solve a real problem by enabling 
disconnected operation.

That having been said, I note your position and take it seriously.
Thanks for delurking.
