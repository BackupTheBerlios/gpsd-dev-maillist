<PRE>-T option *will be removed*.  I am insistent on this for the same
reason I implemented autobauding -- I want gpsd to be zero-configuration
so users don't have to do *any* system administration to use it.  Just
fire it up and forget about it.

Presently, here's how the autoconfig works.

1. Ay each baud rate gpsd grabs packets until it sees either a
   well-formed and checksum-verified NMEA packet, a well-formed and
   checksum-verified SiRF packet, or it sees one of the two special 
   trigger strings EARTHA or ASTRAL, or it fills a long buffer with garbage
   (in which case it steps to the next baud rate).

2. If it finds a SiRF packet, it queries the chip for firmware
   version.  If the version is &lt; 231.000 it drops back to SiRF NMEA.
   We're done.

3. If it finds EARTHA, it selects the Earthmade driver, which then
   flips the connection to Zodiac binary mode.  We're done.

4. If it finds ASTRAL, it feeds the TripMate on the other end what
   it wants and goes to Tripmate NMEA mode.  We're done.

5. If it finds a NMEA packet, it selects the NMEA driver.  This
   initializes by shipping all vendor-specific initialization strings
   to the device.  Presently there are two such, one for SiRF and one
   for the FV-18.  The FV18 just sets some sentence frequencies, but
   the SiRF one is itself a probe,

6. Now gpsd reads NMEA packets.  If it sees a driver trigger string it
   invokes the matching driver.  Presently there is really only one of
   these: &quot;$Ack Input 105.\r\n&quot;, the response to the SiRF probe. On
   seeing this, gpsd switches from NMEA to SiRF binary mode, probes
   for firmware version, and either stays in binary or drops back 
   to SiRF NMEA.

The outcome is that we know exactly what we're looking at, without any
driver or baud rate options.

The Garmin driver spoils this picture a bit, but Gary is working on
a probe function.

Now, there is one big piece of configuration left.  We have to specify
a serial device for gpsd to look at.  Our next big question is: how
do we get rid of this requirement?  If we could manage that, gpsd
would be completely zero-configuration.

Serial device discovery is hard.  The main reason it's hard is
RS232 devices, which (unlike USB devices) don't post any notifications 
in a well-known place when they go active.  

However, we may get the next best thing.  At FUDcon, David Zeuthen
told me he wants to integrate GPSD with HAL&lt; the Hardware Abstraction
Layer.  HAL is implemented by a daemon which listens for hotplug
events.  When it sees a device go active, its job is to query the
device and decide what should be dispatched to handle it.  

Given a bit of probe logic, HAL could learn to fire up gpsd on a
device whenever it detects a GPS at the other end.  This is the
*other* reason I wrote the autobauding code -- for HAL.
