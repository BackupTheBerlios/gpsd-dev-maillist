<PRE>VMIN = 0 and VTIME = 0

    This is a completely non-blocking read - the call is satisfied
    immediately directly from the driver's input queue. If data are
    available, it's transferred to the caller's buffer up to nbytes and
    returned. Otherwise zero is immediately returned to indicate &quot;no
    data&quot;. We'll note that this is &quot;polling&quot; of the serial port, and it's
    almost always a bad idea. If done repeatedly, it can consume enormous
    amounts of processor time and is highly inefficient. Don't use this
    mode unless you really, really know what you're doing.

VMIN = 0 and VTIME &gt; 0

    This is a pure timed read. If data are available in the input queue,
    it's transferred to the caller's buffer up to a maximum of nbytes, and
    returned immediately to the caller. Otherwise the driver blocks until
    data arrives, or when VTIME tenths expire from the start of the
    call. If the timer expires without data, zero is returned. A single
    byte is sufficient to satisfy this read call, but if more is available
    in the input queue, it's returned to the caller. Note that this is an
    overall timer, not an intercharacter one.  VMIN &gt; 0 and VTIME &gt; 0

VMIN &gt; 0 and VTIME &gt; 0

    A read() is satisfied when either VMIN characters have been
    transferred to the caller's buffer, or when VTIME tenths expire
    between characters. Since this timer is not started until the first
    character arrives, this call can block indefinitely if the serial line
    is idle. This is the most common mode of operation, and we consider
    VTIME to be an intercharacter timeout, not an overall one. This call
    should never return zero bytes read.

VMIN &gt; 0 and VTIME = 0

    This is a counted read that is satisfied only when at least VMIN
    characters have been transferred to the caller's buffer - there is no
    timing component involved. This read can be satisfied from the
    driver's input queue (where the call could return immediately), or by
    waiting for new data to arrive: in this respect the call could block
    indefinitely. We believe that it's undefined behavior if nbytes is
    less then VMIN.

It doesn't look to me like VMIN=1 is needed, given that this is already
a blocking read, but it can't hurt either. Done.
