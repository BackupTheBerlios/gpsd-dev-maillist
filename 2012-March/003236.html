Either my ISP is slow delivering the mail or this part of the discussion was 
off-list. If the latter, please (Geoff) keep this on-list.

As for keeping the border, the use of 'XmNgeometry' is a very crude way to 
achieve it. The proper way might best involve defining a true Motif 'Frame' 
widget. I think there's also a 'Margin' resource that might apply, but maybe 
only if a 'Frame' is present (can't recall ATM). FWIW, I was thinking of 
addressing this border issue (among many others) if/when a reworking of the 
'xgps' app is undertaken.

&gt;<i> Aha!  Now we have a kill button.  It was this line
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     XtSetArg(args[4], XmNdeleteResponse, XmDO_NOTHING);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> suppressing it, I'll bet.
</I>
I believe this, but it doesn't jibe with what you said above. If you truly had 
tested using my suggested fix (eliminate the setting of _all_ the 'Top Level' 
widget resources)...

Marr &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">marr at flex.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> In fact, there's really no need to set _any_ of the resources on the Motif 
</I>&gt;<i> 'Top Level' widget. If you comment out the line that does that:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    XtSetValues(toplevel, args, 6);
</I>
... then you should have seen the 'window kill' button appear in the window 
frame, much like I did with KDE.

I am still confused -- were we just &quot;talking past each other&quot;?

&gt;<i> Modern UI practice has moved towards relying on the action triggered by the
</I>&gt;<i> window manager kill button to cleanly terminate an application.  I'm quite
</I>&gt;<i> tempted to remove the quit button entirely.  Thoughts?
</I>
I tend to agree here. Personally, I could easily do without a dedicated in-app 
'Quit' pushbutton (and any in-app menu 'File', 'Quit' nonsense for cases 
where that applies). Having said that, it probably breaks some UI &quot;style 
guide&quot; and might lead to confusion, so be prepared for some &quot;pushback&quot;. Also, 
I was planning on moving the dedicated 'Quit' pushbutton up and over, under 
the graphical part of the 'xgps' display, as you (Eric) suggested earlier. 
Ultimately though, I'd still vote to eliminate it. How's that for a 
long-winded way to agree with what Geoff said in just 3 words? :^)
