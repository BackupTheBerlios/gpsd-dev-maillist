<PRE>and they're all very well supported.
In theory I could even push my Debian work into the same repository (although
that would need some preparation, but it would be possible)

I have to admit that git has a *steep* learning curve, but the documents on
<A HREF="http://git.or.cz/index.html">http://git.or.cz/index.html</A> - for example the Git-SVN crash course - is are
good to understand, although it may take some time until you know more about
git. I'm using it for more than a year now, and I doubt I've used all tools yet.

Git has several other advantages for me:
- From my subjective impression it is the fastest of all, especially when you
have a lot of branches and merge often.
- There are a lot of tools which help you to work with git, for example
giggle, and the number of tools is growing, and it is not too complicated to
write such tools since there are git bindings for several languanges, for
example Python.
- There are several git hosting providers where the source could be published
and automatically synced to (like github or repo.or.cz). I think not depending
on a single repository is a good thing. But I think there are free hg hosting
providers these days, too.
- Git creates checksums for each commit, even if you pull a repository again
from untrusted sources, you're able to verify each of your commits.

If anybody is interested to give git a try, install git-svn and run the following:

git-svn clone --stdlayout svn+<A HREF="ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpsd">ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpsd</A>

(that's the svn url for developers, not sure what the svn url for non-devs is,
would have to look it up - but that would work, too)

In case you want to commit from there, please read the manpage first - the
short summary is: don't merge branches, use rebase. Svn can't handle merges in
the way git (and I guess others) do.

&gt;<i> I'm not very worried about these differences.  Our devs are smart and
</I>&gt;<i> adaptable, and our project is relatively small.  Either tool would
</I>&gt;<i> probably do fine for us.
</I>
Indeed. I maintain packages of several programs where I pull from cvs or svn
into git and - speaking of gpsd - send my commits with git-svn, so I'm fine
with any way, as long as I can import it. Also I have not yet started to build
from svn directly, but I'm working on doing so already.
