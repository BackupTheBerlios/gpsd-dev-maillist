<PRE>[Eric S. Raymond]
&gt;<i> Very, very weird.  Neither of my SiRF-II devices shows behavior
</I>&gt;<i> anything like this.  I'm consistently seeing 12 satellites here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you generate a log with both the raw and GPSD protocol lines of
</I>&gt;<i> a session exhibiting this?
</I>
I investigated some more, and I suspect I was mistaken.  Closer
inspection indicate that what happened was that the set of displayed
satellites switched.  The satellites with good signal strength was
kept, and several of the other satellites were replaced with other
satellites also above me.  After a short second, the set of satellites
were switched back.  This is probably what I saw earlier too.  The
switch back and forth is quite fast, so it is hard to read out out the
satellite numbers before it switches back.  I used gps3d to figure
this out, as it keep track of the position of all the satellites it
has seen, and it didn't show any satellites jumping back and forth.

I've tested the latest svn version of the NMEA parser, and it is still
not agreeing with the roadgps parser on the set of satellites used in
the solution (only saw 1).  My rewritten parser showed a larger seg of
satellites being used (saw 2), but roadgps showed the largest set (4).

What are your plans regarding my restructuring of the NMEA parser
code.  The restructuring make it easier to write parsers, as the
argument count is available up front, and also reduces the need to
split the sentences every time a field is read.  As far as I can see,
there are no down-sides to it.  There is a possibility of
destabilizing the code, but as I copied the new code from roadgsp
where it is working already, and only changed 'field(sentence, #)' to
'field[#]', it is not many places where errors could have sneaked
in. :)

I would love to try to debug the current parsing problems, but do not
really want to continue before I know the argument count will be
available and the fields are already split out for the parsers to use.
