<PRE>Pursuant to previous discussion, I have implemented a shared-memory
export for GPSD using a slight variant of the bookend-consistency algorithm 
I previously described.  It's working.  In fact, it worked perfectly on
the first try, which makes me wonder what special perversity the dread
god Finagle and his mad prophet Murphy have stored up for me.

The variation is in the way the copy is done. I blogged about the technique
at &lt;<A HREF="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=3065">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=3065</A>&gt;, and in the first comment Daniel Franke
pointed out that as long as the fields in the wrapper structure are written
last-to-first, the byte-copy order for the payload itself doesn't matter.

I have not yet attempted to implement memory barriers, and the reader code
may fail on x64 Atom and any other platform that implements memcpy() with
a reverse rather than forward byte copy.  It relies on a GCCism to
prevent reordering of the copy operations.  An I may yet replace it
with a semaphore-based technique.

Still, this is both proof-of-concept and working code, and may be of
interest to those working a similar problem in NTPD.

In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession 
or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches 
in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the 
preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot 
say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear 
such an instrument. [...] The Militia comprised all males 
physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.
