<PRE>Eric expressed interest in my web interface for my forg
(github.com/tz1/webgpsd).  So for the next iteration, I thought I
would start the discussion.

Let me describe the features and functions and see what I can start to
port and a few problems.

First, both support multiple devices, but what is the best way to
handle it?  Multiple satellite position displays?  Select the device
first?  For maps, if there is more than one device, which one do I use
(webgpsd checks the DoP each second and has a &quot;best&quot; which is always
used for the web pages).

The way I've implemented it is to look for the relevant HTTP strings
in the request sent to gpsd, e.g &quot;<A HREF="http://netbook.local:294/XXX">http://netbook.local:294/XXX</A>&quot;
creates &quot;GET /XXX HTTP/1.1...&quot;  If the GET and HTTP/1.? match, I parse
what is between to pick what is returned.  I could check the rest of
the strings, but most of the stuff is stateless and with the right
tags is universal.

I default to a base status page with a meta refresh=5 tag that
displays a table of standard GPS information and a satellite table
which works on any browser, safari, firefox, IE, or even Lynx or text
browsers because it is HTML formatted - json is available for pure
text  (&quot;json&quot; in the path will return json used by the satellite
stats).  I have links to the other feature pages, google maps (moving
with traffic), radar, and the satellite status.

I return a KML network location link if the text has &quot;kml&quot; in it so
google earth can be used to track the GPS.

I have a Google Maps v2 API responder that will send an XML marker for
older google maps applications.

I include a google map v3 API moving map that uses an XML query which
I respond to and US weather radar from wunderground.com (which has a
scrapable lat/lon/radious generator which has allowed me to dodge bad
storms on my harley).

Attached is an example I don't know of the listserv will allow it
through - it doesn't show the track or speed since the GPS is still,
but shows the satellites, the signal strength (boxes), number, and
HDOP which is the magenta circle.  This is all in HTML5 canvas with
javascript with XHTML requests and json parsing.  I'm in the process
of updating it.

So would this be a good idea to add to gpsd-ng?  Could it or an
enhanced version replace some of the other client utilities?
