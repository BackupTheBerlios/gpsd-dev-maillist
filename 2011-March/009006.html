<PRE>Dave Hart &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">davehart at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> That sort of reasoning about buffer overflow/truncation seems
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistent to me with your stated goal of ensuring a gpsd bug
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't kill someone.
</I>
Um, don't conflate two issues.  We are actually *extremely* careful about
overruns.  That's why we consistently use strlcpy/strlcat and *snprintf.
I don't think this particular overrun problem is worth worrying about
*but we foreclose it anyway* - I should not have let myself sound as
though we're being less careful than we are.

My statement should really only be read as &quot;I'm not worried about
device node truncation&quot;. And there's a reason for that specific to
GPSD.  That device node truncation could map you from a serial device
*to* any readable device or file is quite unlikely to begin with, but the
daemon has another layer of protection in that it is very picky about
what it accepts as input.

For GPSD to be fooled or compromised by device-node truncation, the 
node or file you read from would generally have to produce framed and
checksummed packets.  The joint probability of &quot;you land on another readable
device&quot; and &quot;it gives you well-formed packets&quot; and &quot;it's not a GPS itself&quot;
is, I think, too low to worry about.

I recognize that other programs with less ability to reject bogus input
would be more vulnerable and the general problem is thus real.

&gt;<i>                      Moreover, it's more thought than it's worth --
</I>&gt;<i> just do the right thing every time.  It's an easy habit to get into,
</I>&gt;<i> and it allows static analysis tools, for example, to flag questionable
</I>&gt;<i> code without triggering &quot;false&quot; positives where you have convinced
</I>&gt;<i> yourself a long input is impossible or harmless.
</I>
We use splint regularly.  It's a pain in the ass, but it tends to catch one
or two real bugs per release cycle.

&gt;<i> You will find very few strcpy() or strcat() or sprintf() remaining in
</I>&gt;<i> the NTP reference implementation tarballs, though there were quite a
</I>&gt;<i> few two years ago, because I've been hunting down and addressing
</I>&gt;<i> potential buffer overruns.
</I>
Quite right. I'm careful about this, and Chris Keuthe prods me when I slip.

&gt;<i> Coverity did not produce any scans of ntpd for nearly a year ending
</I>&gt;<i> this January, and I've never been told why, and had to discover myself
</I>&gt;<i> by logging into their site that they had finally picked up again,
</I>&gt;<i> where a simple email would have let me react to the issues more than a
</I>&gt;<i> month sooner.  Still, I appreciate every scrap of donated static
</I>&gt;<i> analysis from them and others and I recognize they have paying
</I>&gt;<i> customers which take priority over their open source activities.
</I>
I haven't been able to get Coverity to respond to requests for a 
rescan since 2007.  What procedure did you use to successfully
wake them up?

&gt;<i> In over 10 years of NTP4 releases, there have been 4 security hotfixes
</I>&gt;<i> issued [2].
</I>
We've never had one.  The last time we had a bug with known security 
implications was in 2005, and I think that was our first.

&gt;<i> If gpsd developers currently having access to Coverity Scan results do
</I>&gt;<i> not have time to investigate, please ask <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">dmaxwell at coverity.com</A> to
</I>&gt;<i> grant userid davehart access to gpsd scan results.
</I>
My last attempt to wake up Coverity was an email query to dmaxwell.  
He didn't respond.
