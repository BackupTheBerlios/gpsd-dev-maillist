The problem is simply that it _does_ not work in the general case, even 
when written in asm in order to absolutely guarantee program write order:

The cpu memory interface is totally free to re-arrange the actual 
flushes to ram, meaning that absent a memory barrier type instruction, 
another physical cpu can read stale values for the bookend sentinels, 
and fresh data in between.

However, with all current (cached) cpu architectures, if you make sure 
that the entire buffer, including the sentinels, are located in the same 
cache line, i.e. in a single 32/64/128-byte aligned block, and can 
control the program write order, _then_ it should indeed be impossible 
for a second cpu to see a partially updated cache line.

This is part of the cpu contract for an x86 cpu, while on an Alpha you 
do _NOT_ have any such guarantees, it is just extremely hard to come up 
with a hardware bus sequence that would allow it to break.

The solution is therefore still to have a write barrier before the final 
update which makes the new record valid.

On x86 I really like LOCK XADD, but for a single writer and a counter 
which is allowed to wrap around LOCK INC will work as well.

Both of them avoids OS calls.

&quot;almost all programming can be viewed as an exercise in caching&quot;
