<PRE>Michael R. Davis &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">mrdvt92 at yahoo.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Compile time options do nothing for the 99% of the people out there
</I>&gt;<i>  who want there distro to install their GPS device correctly.
</I>
That's correct.  We have essentially two important deployment scenarios:

(1) Generic laptop.  This version wants all drivers because there's no telling
wht's going to get plugged into a USB port next.

(2) Well-controlled embedded environments.  This is tz's case, also for example
the OpenMoko abd Maemo cases.  These will often use FIXED_PORT_SPEED and
need just one driver, or possibly two -- NMEA pluse SiRF or some other 
single binary type. *But* you can't predict *which* additional driver
it's going to be without knowing the target hardware.

This is why tz's --minimalist idea won't fly. It's useless for either
case.  In the first case it's wrong, and in the second case you don't
know which extra drivers should live in the minimal set.

&gt;<i> This is where I feel we (gpsd-dev folks) need more work.  The
</I>&gt;<i> concept of plug-ins would resolve much of this headache as we could
</I>&gt;<i> put plug-ins in different packages (with lesser supported ones out
</I>&gt;<i> of the main stream build).
</I>
No, no, no, *no*.  For us, plugins (runtime DLLs) would be a complete
red herring.  Bad, *bad* idea.  Here's why...

The overhead of an additional driver is pretty small.  Look:

   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  11677	      0	      0	  11677	   2d9d	driver_aivdm.o
   5520	      0	      0	   5520	   1590	driver_evermore.o
  10527	      0	      0	  10527	   291f	driver_garmin.o
   3358	      0	      0	   3358	    d1e	driver_garmin_txt.o
  12692	      0	      0	  12692	   3194	driver_geostar.o
   6494	      0	      0	   6494	   195e	driver_italk.o
  16616	      0	      0	  16616	   40e8	driver_navcom.o
  11973	      0	      0	  11973	   2ec5	driver_nmea.o
   3962	     65	      0	   4027	    fbb	driver_oncore.o
   3864	      0	      0	   3864	    f18	driver_rtcm2.o
   8213	      0	      0	   8213	   2015	driver_rtcm3.o
  13203	    390	      0	  13593	   3519	driver_sirf.o
   8651	    256	      0	   8907	   22cb	drivers.o
   5243	      6	      0	   5249	   1481	driver_superstar2.o
  17810	      0	      0	  17810	   4592	driver_tsip.o
   7478	      0	    516	   7994	   1f3a	driver_ubx.o
   5202	      0	      0	   5202	   1452	driver_zodiac.o

That's 152K for *everything*, with individual drivers averaging 9K each.
Even on decade-old general-purpose hardware this is nothing.  And
embedded deploymonts don't have to carry more than about 20K.

In our domain, plugins simply can't give us enough space optimization
to be worth the additional runtime complexity and packaging hassles
they would imply.

The other reason to do plugins besides space optimization is that you
have technical or legal reasons to need some of your drivers to be
developed outside your project. But we are not the GIMP or Musicbox or
VLC. We don't have that problem and don't need that opportunity.

&gt;<i>                        Let's face it; GPS chips (location aware
</I>&gt;<i> chips) are going to be in the next laptop we need to be ready for
</I>&gt;<i> that kind of pervasiveness.
</I>
I agree.  But that won't change a thing for *us*. We're ready
*now*. We're so ready it's almost silly. Here's why.

The lowest-level GPS component any system integrator ever puts in a
laptop or smartphone is an OEM module that reports packets over TTL
serial lines when you power it up.  There's just no good reason to
ever do anything else; the reference designs are all paid for, and the
data rates are low enough for TTL serial to make sense.  Anything else
would be pointlessly expensive.

So, from the OS-kernel point of view, all a GPS module is going to be
is a special serial (RS232 device) - and I'll bet you any vital organ
you care to name it'll present as a pseudo-tty named /dev/gps (or
/dev/gps0, /dev/gps1, etc.)  

We are so *completely* ready for this! I could write the discovery
loop in about fifteen minutes flat.

&gt;<i> We, also, should be driving the interface and protocol that that GPS
</I>&gt;<i> chips should be using in this future.  I'd like to suggest that
</I>&gt;<i> serial is not the way to go.
</I>
Fuhgeddabouddit.  We have no clout with the manufacturers, And we
don't need it, either, not for this.  A virtual serial device shipping
any of our supported protocols would fit our existing architecture
like a grove, *and that's exactly what we're going to get*.  Doing
anything else would require everyone in the systems-integration chain
before us to spend extra NRE to no purpose.
