</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the man page says: &quot;While the one-per-second PPS pulses emitted by

</I>&gt;<i> 0.01-second precision. Thus, the timestamps that gpsd reports in
</I>&gt;<i> time/position/velocity messages are normally accurate only to 1/100th
</I>&gt;<i> of a second.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You device may claim accuracy of less than 0.01s, but it's fibbing.
</I>
I don't think it is claiming higher accuracy, but if it is running at,
say 8Hz update or something, It will return .125, .250, .375 ... etc.
I think it is merely for that purpose.  The internal timer to generate
the messages is in milliseconds in common units.

accuracy != precision, and in this case it is precise but not accurate.

Also, when adding other devices (gyros, accelerometers), they can be
synced with the 1pps and offer higher accuracy.

My concern here is I would rather specify an &quot;unknown&quot; number of
decimal digits whose accuracy is questionable rather than locking
things down to two decimal digits.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I also noticed that TPV is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually tagged RMC, but GLL has some info and GGA is where altitude
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resides. &#160;The &quot;tag&quot; seems to be arbitrarily chosen, but enough so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to ask why is it there, or if there should be a specification,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the SKY is always tagged GSV although GSA is also key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You've encountered one of the wonderful...let's be nice and call them
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;quirks&quot;...that makes writing GPS software such wholesome family
</I>&gt;<i> entertainment.
</I>
I've encountered this and worse - I've been doing this for years.

&gt;<i> On NMEA devices, a single sample is turned into a burst of sentences that
</I>&gt;<i> normally includes a GGA, an RMC, and (sometimes) a GLL. &#160;None of these sentences
</I>&gt;<i> are sufficient information to generate a TPV by itself, and they arrive in a
</I>&gt;<i> device-dependent random order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd copes with this by watching sentences come through until it sees a
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp change. &#160;It then recognizes the *previous* sentence as the
</I>&gt;<i> cycle ender. &#160;Subsequently arrival of that sentence triggers a TPV report
</I>&gt;<i> based on the cumulated data from start of cycle, followed by clearing of
</I>&gt;<i> the cumulated data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The TPV will be decorated with the tag of the cycle-ender sentence.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually, though not always, this is an RMC.
</I>
To clarify, it will queue data and emit a fix when the timestamp changes?
e.g.
RMC1, GLL1, GGA1 RMC2- triggers fix(RMC1-GLL1-GGA1) and starts fix(RMC2...)

Doesn't this introduce a second of latency if the update rate is 1Hz?

&gt;<i> (There are entire universes of implementation pain, weird edge cases, and
</I>&gt;<i> hard-learned black art lurking behind this blithe summary. When I say you
</I>&gt;<i> do not want to write your own gpsd, this is one of the major reasons.)
</I>
I already did, and that was just for NMEA, and at 5Hz+ so I've already
gone through it, like the GPS16/18 from garmin that at 5Hz doesn't
update the date until about 700mS after midnight UTC.  That was back
on my Kyocera router on MIPS.  It is also the reason I log the raw
NMEA (kml files with XML comments bearing the raw data).

But my original question was the purpose for the tag in the first
place.  Why is it important for anything downstream to know it was
GGA, or RMC that triggered things?

(skyview elided)

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Is there a pattern to which fields are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> populated?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fields are populated if the underlying device supplies them or supplies
</I>&gt;<i> enough information to compute them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Also I noticed xdop and ydop being populated although I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only have the GPGSA, so they are computed (unless you have a GPS that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has these in a sentence). &#160;But I don't think there is enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information to compute these as such, only turn hdop into a square.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there is. &#160;It's possible to compute DOPs from the skyview with a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of matrix algebra. gpsd does this internally because devices are
</I>&gt;<i> very bad about returning the full set. &#160;Yes, this is another yawning
</I>&gt;<i> pit full of evil black art and another reason not to roll your own.
</I>
So it uses the skyview raw data to compute [xyz]DoP?  This is a lot of
computation if someone doesn't need the extra data, and the skyview is
returned.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a reason computed values are returned alongside the direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> values?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not certain what &quot;direct&quot; values you mean.
</I>
The GPS itself returns HDOP, VDOP, and PDOP.  To that you add
[XYZ]DOP. which are computed.

&gt;&gt;<i> On the gpsd.8 manpage and xml, &quot;Responce&quot; is used - that might be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non US variant of response, otherwise it is a typo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You must be looking at an old version; I can't find this in git head.
</I>
My error - I didn't pull the most recent version - it has been fixed
in the last few days.

I think you also need to update the website copies of the manpages as
I first noticed it there.

&gt;&gt;<i> I am also having trouble with the json commands and responses, i.e.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what is required for a gpsd-ng compatible implementation to do (if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't printout a VERSION object when connected? &#160;Missing WATCH
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responses? &#160;Responses to things it doesn't understand but a newer one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might). &#160;It says &quot;it does this&quot; in places but not if the order of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outputs is critical or optional.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'll have to specify your questions more exactlly, sorry. As in:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I send X, Y is expected, I see Z. &#160;What do I do?&quot;
</I>
But that is the root of my question.  There is no recommended practice
or guaranteed responses or even much clarity to how to send the
commands.

I send it a ?WATCH={'json':true}; and get some not really specified
response.  You get some kind of Device - one or more?, maybe a watch
status, I remember a third line...  I've sent different variants
(double quotes, ordering) of ?WATCH={'enabled':true,'json':true}; and
json was not set to true sometimes.

So you send some kind of not very well specified blob, and get back
some kind of not very well specified blob - if it happens to contain
fields, the contents are detailed.

What I was expecting is something like (don't take these to be accurate)

?WATCH= MUST specify parameters in a specific order
?WATCH= SHOULD specify enable last in the list
?WATCH= MAY specify parameters in any order

(I also can't seem to find a way to only watch for position TPV and
not get the SKY but I might just be dense - I don't think browser
location will need SKY).

The response MUST return the following:...  The response SHOULD ...
The response MAY...  Both for content and ordering.

For the TPV - are the device and tag fields MUST, SHOULD, or MAY?
They might be for libgps, but not if you are decoding the json
directly.

This might not belong on the gpsd.8 manpage, but it is a detailed
protocol and it isn't really documented as a protocol.  Think RFC
(actually that would be a good idea - do an RFC to document this).
There should be a certain minimum MUST.

The actual protocol is whatever standard you want to set and has to
precisely describe the behavior of whatever implementation.  Right now
it is &quot;whatever the code does&quot; and the code can change.  If some are
depending on specific fields and they go away, it will break.

One of the problems with the original GPSD is it was quirky - the
commands and responses were all ad-hoc but at least were uniform and
constant.

JSON creates the problem because it is &quot;extensible&quot;, but also
contractable, e.g. no altitude for 2d.  But is this behavior set in
stone, or ad-hoc?
