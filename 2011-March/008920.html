<PRE>I'm going to have to rip the NMEA stuff apart and redo much of it
anyway for NOFLOAT anyway, and that is going to be a more radical
change.

I think I can get something more consistent for the TPV, or at least
more robust.

Someone pointed out that it might be possible to get more than 3
satellites with a 2d fix, but I don't think I've ever seen it, but I
can check.

My logs cover Garmin, MTK, SkyTraq/Venus, and UBlox/Antaris.  I don't
have Sirf or others immediately available

I'll also see if I can do something to show the latency as I'm
probably going to do some performance testing and banchmarking anyway.

</I>&gt;<i> Possibly. &#160;This is not a case we've ever seen in the wild.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would work better if it would first accumulate the bitmap

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same set of bits are set - clearing the field if the fixtime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if you had RMC/GLL/GGA initially or after a few cycles, you would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require all three with the same fixtime to update the fix. &#160;You can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> misidentify an &quot;ender&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would produce fewer fixes, e.g. if RMC updates at rate 2, GLL at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3, and GGA at 5, but if a GPS is set that way you really can't do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. &#160;I suspect the reason the aggregate-to-fix algorithm looks robust
</I>&gt;<i> to us and fragile to you is that, in the consumer grade of hardware we're used
</I>&gt;<i> to testing, cycle behavior is very stereotyped. &#160; I don't think we've *ever*
</I>&gt;<i> seen a case where RMC, GLL, and GLL were being emitted at different rates,
</I>&gt;<i> though some of the devices we support do have that as a theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> capability. &#160;Closest we've come to it is one really old Garmin that
</I>&gt;<i> emitted RMC and GLL in asymmetrical half-cycles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you think you can harden the driver to behave sanely in that case, go
</I>&gt;<i> ahead. &#160;We've got enough wacky NMEA-variant test loads that I'm willing to
</I>&gt;<i> have drastic things done to that driver in confidence that we can test
</I>&gt;<i> for introduced bugs *very* thoroughly.
