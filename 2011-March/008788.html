<PRE>(Copied to dev; this sort of architecture discussion can and should be public.)

Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> If nothing else [tz is] making me wonder about how to refactor all of our
</I>&gt;<i> drivers so that everything PROTO is in driver_PROTO.c ... I don't like
</I>&gt;<i> all the tangle that is packet.c, and I think that it would be prettier
</I>&gt;<i> if each driver (where possible) exported a PROTO_checksum function
</I>&gt;<i> that could be used by both the sniffer and packet writers.
</I>
I definitely agree that the packet sniffer is a painful knot in the 
present architecture. I'd love to break it apart into per-driver pieces
if that were possible, but I haven't been able to imagine a way to do that.

As for breaking out the checksum function:  If you look, you'll see
that the driver structures already have a control_send member that's a
checksum generator.  So the write side of this is already factored as
you suggest.  

The read side (the checksum verifiers) could move to the driver
structure, too, but I haven't seem a lot of point in that while we're
still stuck with the rest of packet.c as a single hairball.  The
checksum code is a fairly small increment on that.

Besides, there are some subtle issues with trying. The biggest one is that
checksum functions aren't indexed by driver type but rather by packet type.
Packet-type-to-driver lookup is a bit messy because multiple drivers can
share the same packet type - you'd end up with a lookup function that is
time-quadratic in the number of drivers rather than getting that dispatch
for free from the state machine's flow of control.
