</I>
OK, technically I can build gpsd on my chumby hacker board.  What it requires:
You need to completely reformat and partition drives so you can get
fedora core 12 for ARM (there may be others like debian but that is
what I used). as a chroot environment.  Once the structure is
bootstrapped, you then have to do yum install (apt-get) for all the
packages, which need to be downloaded and unpacked.  Oh, you need an
8g or 16g micro SD and you need to create a swap file or partition
since anything beyond a trivial build will require swapping since
there is only a 64M chip and the processor doesn't support more.  This
will take over 8 hours.  Maybe longer.  You will need to have included
all the autotools and whatever other parts.  Then you can grab the
gpsd-ng repository.  Run autogen.sh, which runs ./configure.  This
will take a good portion of an hour, and if you want bluetooth you
need to watch and break the process or you will have to restart it.
Finally you have a make file, and can type &quot;make&quot;.  That will also
take about 15 minutes.  So on that board, it would take about a full
day to generate the first gpsd-ng binary.  Assuming you don't make a
mistake.  Getting fc12 up was a big effort, but I wanted bluetooth and
avahi and they weren't in the native build and have similar issues
with the autotools.  I haven't actually built any, I've just used fc12
to check feasability.

There is an unpackable gcc environment with make and enough to build
the linux kernel and most of the rest of the things.  It takes about 5
minutes to unpack.  I still need the swapfile but not for the install.

I would almost bet that a simple ordinary plain makefile with just the
gpsd executable, the component objects, and a few configuration lines
for paths and such would work out of the box on most of the other
systems mentioned - solaris, bsd, etc.  Anything with a reasonable
libc.  What are you doing that is so weird that it REQUIRES going
through autogen?  I don't see much outside of libc (the only things
are optional pthread mutexes, bluez, and dbus).

To go backwards for a moment, I implemented my own zipper to convert
the KML files to KMZ, and I would spawn gzip.  Why?  Because libz was
NOT on the target system (in this case MIPS), but gzip was in the
statically linked busybox.  In fact, this was one of the major
headaches on the nokia tablets - it used embedded versions of a lot of
programs and although there were debs for the everything, they would
not easily fit - which is why everything was done under scratchbox
with the full versions of all the utilities.  So for this MIPs system,
I would spawn and filter the file through gzip, and swap headers and
append the central directory.  And yes, I was that hard up for memory.
 The flash had a fixed size and was nearly full, so I couldn't waste
anything.

&gt;<i> I think requirements are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; build can be done native or cross, without requiring execution of any target binaries. &#160; This mean the qemu semi-cross build is not a good enough answer - even though it's fine if people want to do it that way.
</I>
To clarify, if it is going to use a huge set of hairy tools, it needs
to cross compile without qemu and without special knowledge or hassle
trying to duplicate the target environment.  The target environment
may or may not have bluez or other bluetooth, but it should build
either way without installing any target binary or library.

If it uses a lightweight build environment, it can be done natively.

&gt;<i> &#160;build works on substantially any semi-reasonable platform, similar to what it does now, and this includes things that gpsd developers have never heard of
</I>
yes, but the key word is &quot;reasonable&quot;.  If you are only using some
flavor of libc to build gpsd, you shouldn't have to test for the
presence of each individual call, or if things are in strange places,
you would have to hack up autogen.sh anyway and that defeats the
purpose - it is easier to edit the top 20 lines of a makefile than to
hack any of these thousand line build scripts.

&gt;<i> &#160;shared libraries are done in the correct way for each platform, without gpsd having to define what that means
</I>
No, it produces correct shared and/or static libraries for the
platform using whichever way is convenient.  For a long time SSLeay
(predecessor to openssl) could be turned into a shared library by
simply doing &quot;ar x ../libssl.a&quot;, then a &quot;ld -shared... *.o&quot; in a
subdirectory.  No libtool needed.  Everything else compiled and linked
with the libssleay[vers].so without problems.

&gt;<i> &#160;basic platform adaptation mechanisms are in place, as they are now
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;there is no assumption that the python interpreter, in either host or target, is called python. &#160;E.g., python2.6 should be fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and what we don't have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;one can give switches to build without python *on the target* (ok, maybe we can do that)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;one can give switches so that the only programs which depend on python are installed, to ease making a split package of the python dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that I&quot;m not arguing against python as a build dependency. &#160;(Although I find objecting to auto* as too heavy and then being happy about python bizarre; objecting to auto* as fragile is another matter, but it's not heavy.)
</I>
./configure as produced by ./autogen.sh is over 20000 lines.  I doubt
anything in Python will be 1/10th the length or take more than 1/10th
the time.

They are fragile too.
