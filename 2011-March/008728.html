<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; One major question I have for you is: could you live with scons as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; build system? That would be a relatively easy transition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, provided it didn't have similar dependencies - can I compile it
</I>&gt;<i> quickly and easily on an ARM based system without having to install
</I>&gt;<i> half of the existing auto-tools and libs in a current linux distro
</I>&gt;<i> either for sconf or for the target.
</I>
scons isn't compiled at all. It's a Python program.  If you can run
Python programs, I don't believe it has any odd dependencies.

&gt;<i> Are the following actually protocols?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GPSclock &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: yes
</I>
Yes. It supports a set of extension commands specific to a specialiced
GPS called the Furuno Electric GPSClock (GH-79L4), usable as a precision
time service.

&gt;<i> &gt; Timing support &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: yes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Client debugging support: yes
</I>
Hm, those should be under &quot;Daemon Features&quot;. I'll move them.

&gt;<i> And don't I also need to pull some of the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Daemon Features
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;---------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NTP SHM &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; : yes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NTP PPS &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; : yes
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Yes. That's what I meant by the PPS stuff.  The PPS support talks to an NTPD
instance.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I don't quite inderstand this. &#160;What &quot;NMEA output&quot; is a short string of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integers? &#160;NMEA sentences generally at least have an alphabetic tag.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The alphabetic tag is used with strncmp in an if-else tree.
</I>
Oh, I see. Unlike my packet sniffer.  Well...let's strip out what we can,

&gt;<i> Even if you were to use sscanf into an integer type, sscanf is a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of code to pick out numbers.
</I>
It is.  We'll tackle this.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;It would be intertesting to compare ncycles
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How would you recommend we do this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Come up with the stripped NMEA gpsd-ng 2.96, and run it with a 10Hz
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA GPS on a soft-float ARM embedded board like a chumby hacker
</I>&gt;<i> board, or maybe an early jailbroken iPhone or not-top/thin client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Compile my version (though I do things like logging to KML files and I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have a way to #ifdef them out).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does gdb have some fine timer so you could time between two
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints (or if there were a hardware timer available you could
</I>&gt;<i> just add a line before an after to measure microseconds, or use a port
</I>&gt;<i> and an oScope).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could run both for say 1000 seconds using time and show the
</I>&gt;<i> system/user time.  Or check the CPU load with top or something.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have one master select() it sits at so you could also use a digital
</I>&gt;<i> storage scope or something from the point the select returns to the
</I>&gt;<i> point it starts again if you want overall processing time.
</I>
Saving this for the record.  I'll look for a hardware timer in gdb;
I don't have the hardware to do these other things.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;As I've shown, you are using libraries and floats everywhere. &#160;We're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;talking extreme liposuction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes. &#160;But it's the right thing to do. &#160;We'll just have to take it in steps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK - we're agreed here in that case.  I didn't want to suggest it
</I>&gt;<i> earlier since I didn't think it would be considered because of the
</I>&gt;<i> size of the task.
</I>
In truth, I welcome this.  I've been concerned about the code getting bloated;
targeting a really constrained deployment will be a good way to find out
exactly where the fat is and slim it down.

&gt;<i> Yes, start with NOFLOAT for NMEA and slowly move it out to the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> the protocols.
</I>
We'll do that, then.
 
&gt;<i> Again, as long as scons is mostly self-contained, it should be OK.
</I>&gt;<i> (Taking a further look, it is basically plain Python, no fancy extra
</I>&gt;<i> libs, so yes)
</I>
Excellent.  That will be the first major task after 2.96 then - sconsifying
the build system.

&gt;<i> The units could be in 100 nano-degree increments without overflowing,
</I>&gt;<i> and in an separate communication, I suggested if there are
</I>&gt;<i> nano-degrees, they can be in a second integer which is otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> always zero, either a short or something such that ((microdegrees &lt;&lt;
</I>&gt;<i> 32) | fractional &amp; 0xffffffff) would produce the precision where
</I>&gt;<i> needed.  There are some RTK systems that do go to centimeter precision
</I>&gt;<i> (100nano).
</I>
Noted. I don't want to go the route of a second integer, at least not
yet.  There are obvious complications lurking there.
