I am sorry but I don't see the problem here:

If the writer can do a number of stores, then perform a memory_barrier() 
which guarantees that all (program-order) stores will be externally 
visible before any following writes, then finally update the counter, 
then I really don't see how a reader can read the new counter value and 
then get the previous value of the data overwritten by the preceding stores?

If you have any pointers I'd be grateful!

OK, if there is only a single buffer, then you need much more 
complicated lockouts, this is one of the things that 2^N buffers makes 
much easier.

I just realized that with a single counter updated once per item, you 
cannot allow the counter to get even close to wrapping around, since in 
that case the writer might be in the process of overwriting the current 
buffer you're using:

I.e. with two buffers the counter must be the same before and after the 
read, with 4 buffers it can have incremented up to two times etc:

   buffer_size = 4;
   mask = buffer_size - 1;
   max_buffer_use = buffer_size - 2;
...

   do {
     old_counter = shm-&gt;count;
     timestamp = shm-&gt;timestamp[count &amp; mask];
     counter = shm-&gt;count;
   } while ((counter - old_counter) &gt;= max_buffer_use);

Interesting stuff!

I believe LOCK on some or all string ops have been made officially 
either illegal or reused for other opcodes on x64?
