<PRE>Bernd Zeimetz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">bernd at bzed.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The reason is proper testing. I'm more or less sure that all of the last
</I>&gt;<i> releases either missed files or had some other nasty bugs.
</I>
I'm not.  We had one release, 2.91, with a missing file.  And if we've
been shipping with &quot;other nasty bugs&quot;, you'd have a tough time demonstrating
that from either the mailing-list traffic or the tracker.

&gt;<i>                                                    Due to a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> changes during the last weeks a proper testing is *not* possible imho.
</I>
You have the causality reversed.  Nobody else tests until I announce an
upcoming release.  I know!  I'll announce imminent next release 10 minutes
after we ship on Monday!  That'll solve *all* the problems.

I also completely reject the premise that &quot;proper testing is not possible&quot;.
If you think that's true, you're (a) ignoring our regression tests, (b)
ignoring flocktest, and (c) *not putting enough effort into improving the
test infrastructure*.

GPSD is in an unusually favored position.  Because the daemon doesn't
have to deal with human inputs, and its output is a deterministic function
of input, completely simulating the circumstances of a bug is not only
possible but replicable.

Thus, your thinking is backwards. If you think we're not testing
enough, the correct response is not to slow down the
development/release cycle, it is to *make automated testing work
better*.  As in better test machinery and a wider collection of test
loads.

&quot;Slow down&quot; is the diametrically *wrong answer*, signaling a failure
of imagination and mental habits carried over from projects on which
testing is genuinely difficult.  I think I have not been sufficiently
clear or forceful about this in the past.

&gt;<i> I'd suggest to create a stable branch, keep that for testing and release it
</I>&gt;<i> after some time if nobody complains. And also ship point-releases from that
</I>&gt;<i> branch. Having only major releases with a lot of changes is a major PITA for
</I>&gt;<i> everybody who wants to ship a bugfree gpsd in a distribution.
</I>
Get some perspective, man!  Do you grasp how few actual,
end-user-visible bugs we have had in the last six years?  I'm not
talking about build glitches, or missing features, or programmers
misunderstanding the protocol, or app developers bitching because we
broke binary library compatibility, or toolchain and udev bugs
tripping us up, or Python version-skew problems, or wacky edge cases
that only our developers ever see.  I mean actual failure of a
properly installed gpsd to do what the documentation says it will do.

I know what that number looks like, because I skimmed the repo logs
and reviewed the closed bugs on Berlios to check.  Tell me when you
last heard of a project deployed on millions of computers, cellphones,
and autonomous robots that has accumulated fewer than a hundred bugs on
its tracker in *six years*.  Or when you last heard of a project
GPSD's size with a measured defect rate of 2 in 22KLOC. Or that's has
so few crash reports that I can remember each one since 2005
individually and count them on the fingers of *one hand*.

You are missing the forest for the trees - so caught up in the
day-to-day packaging issues that you miss the magnitude of what this
small group has accomplished.  You talk of the project as if we've been
shipping an unstable pile of hacks and we need to slow down our headlong
pace, but the truth is we average six months between releases (longer
than an open-source project probably should) and our bug load has been
absurdly, *ridiculously* low, even during the major protocol transition.

I think you should take more pride in what you have contributed to, 
and let go of this notion that our methods are a shambles.  They aren't.
If what we deliver is bad, a lot of projects could use some of our awful.

&gt;<i> I don't know about the other distributions but I'm kinda sure that
</I>&gt;<i> none of them takes as much care of their gpsd package as I do in
</I>&gt;<i> Debian, and for me it is a PITA most of the time.
</I>
You do a really good job.  And of course it's been a PITA.  It's going
to keep being a PITA until we get the protocol and the ABI stable -
believe me, I understand how that particular problem is more of a
load on you than on anyone else.

But that's got nothing to do with how we branch or what our release
tempo is.  Changes that have to come are going to come, as we find out
what the right solutions are.

&gt;<i> And so it seems to be for you for no real reason.
</I>
It usually isn't a pain.  Until I want to get a release shipped and I
have to try and herd the rest of you into testing and feeling happy
about a release before the heat-death of the universe.

&gt;<i> Branching is cheap and fun in git, I fail to understand why it is not done for
</I>&gt;<i> such a project.
</I>
OK, I'll explain it *yet again*.

I don't trust long-lived branches.  Short-lived feature branches, OK; I
have four of those active right now. 

But persistent branches amounting to parallel lines of development are
places where stale code goes to bit-rot and die.  At best, you end up
having to do huge merges that are a bigger pain than continuous
testing on a single mainline would have been.

The habit of using long-lived branches is a response to chronic fear
that you'll break the invariants of your code in a way you can't
detect, and need a &quot;safe&quot; version to fall back on. The trouble with
this is that your methods for QAing a supposedly stable version aren't
any better than your methods for QAing an unstable one. All you really
accomplish by persistent branching is to have two verification
problems of roughly equal and large size, rather than one.

The *correct* response to this fear is to either (a) prove that your
invariants hold, or (b) test that they hold.  If you can do that
with confidence, it ceases to matter whether you have one branch or
a dozen, and the lower complexity of one wins.

Linus Torvalds has figured this out.  The Linux kernel no longer 
has a &quot;stable&quot; branch, and his logic for abolishing it was much
the same as mine.
