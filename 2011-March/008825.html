<PRE>I was looking through the manpage and noticed that the ISO timestamp
only has two digits of precision.  I have some GPSes that return it to
3 digits (when operating at 5Hz or above sometimes they won't sync to
the second unless you tell them to).  I also noticed that TPV is
usually tagged RMC, but GLL has some info and GGA is where altitude
resides.  The &quot;tag&quot; seems to be arbitrarily chosen, but enough so I
have to ask why is it there, or if there should be a specification,
the SKY is always tagged GSV although GSA is also key.

I also noticed that the ISO time entry is only returned for TSV but is
also in the SKY field list (and it apparently depends on the driver).
It doesn't appear to be set immediately for the TPV, so would probably
apply to both equally.  Is there a pattern to which fields are
populated?  Also I noticed xdop and ydop being populated although I
only have the GPGSA, so they are computed (unless you have a GPS that
has these in a sentence).  But I don't think there is enough
information to compute these as such, only turn hdop into a square.
Is there a reason computed values are returned alongside the direct
values?

On the gpsd.8 manpage and xml, &quot;Responce&quot; is used - that might be a
non US variant of response, otherwise it is a typo.

I am also having trouble with the json commands and responses, i.e.
what is required for a gpsd-ng compatible implementation to do (if it
doesn't printout a VERSION object when connected?  Missing WATCH
responses?  Responses to things it doesn't understand but a newer one
might).  It says &quot;it does this&quot; in places but not if the order of
outputs is critical or optional.

If you are writing both sides of the API, it isn't a problem, but if
you want interoperability, the details need to be there.  I can always
telnet or socat and throw things at gpsd-ng, but that doesn't give me
a MAY/SHOULD/MUST for whatever happens to come back.
