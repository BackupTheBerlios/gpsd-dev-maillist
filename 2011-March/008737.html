Just my 2p, but I would have thought that &quot;development is hard&quot; and
builds are done infrequently, often by few people, therefore there seems
less pressure to *build* in a minimal environment than there is to *run*
in a minimal environment.

For example my build environment is some 600MB of random installs, but
the runtime environment is about 8mb and has no python, etc.  I would
really like to try and keep it minimal and especially have no
dependencies on scripting languages (except perhaps lua at a pinch)

</I>
I don't cross compile, but I think cross-compiling works largely
perfectly on Gentoo? (It really is a splendid environment to build an
embedded system - do consider it!)

Some googling shows lots of hits suggesting that folks are working well
with cross-compiling on gentoo generally?  Although, one of the more
common build environments seems to be a native environment running on
the target processor, but using distcc to build your code on some
multicore amd64 monster?


Good luck
