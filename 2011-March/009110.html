I started writing hw interrupt drivers in 1982, at that time I had to 
&quot;compile&quot; them in DEBUG.EXE, then embed the resulting hex bytes in my 
Modula2 source code. :-)

I got the idea for a 32-bit counter that is used to index into a small 
power-of-two array from work I've been discussing in UseNet, on comp.arch:

Using a locked fetch_and_adds (XADD on x86) makes it possible to have 
multiple writers and multiple readers, and as long as the buffer size is 
larger than the number of readers/writers, you can setup a queue where 
nobody ever has to spin, where a hung reader or writer will only affect 
the single entry being read/written by that process, and as long as the 
queue is neither full nor empty, no process ever has to go to sleep.

(BTW, XADD [ebx],eax will fetch the current value in [EBX] and return it 
in EAX, while [EBX] ends up being incremented by the incoming value in 
EAX. I.e. with EAX = 1 you increment the memory counter.)

AFAIR we came up with a total of 6 separate counters needed (write ptr, 
read ptr, valid entries, free entries plus two more which I don't recall 
just now but were needed to guard against special failure modes...

What we have here in shm with a single writer and one or multiple shared 
readers is much, much simpler.
