Yes, definately ugly.

The attached diff cleans libgpsd_core.c by removing the oncore references 
inside libgpsd_core.c, without stripping out the support functionality in 
the driver itself.  So that a proper solution can be worked out without 
rush, but also not having to re-add that code.  (In position hold mode, an 
oncore will never deliver a position fix, as it already has been told 
where it is.  Somehow this has to be modelled, that it has a 'really' good 
time, without claiming a fix.)

I at the moment (for weeks) do not have access to these devices, so can 
test neither this nor a solution, more than compiling.  The ripping only 
has the effect of making oncore devices in position hold mode not deliver 
ntpshm data.

The (independent) use of pulse_delay_ns is also removed, while the code 
potentially using it inside libgpsd_core.c is kept, as the ugly is the way 
to get to the data, not the delay itself.  (An oncore device can be told 
to delay the PPS pulse, thereby making it possible to timestamp several 
gps modules on the same computer.  Multiple devices otherwise all make the 
interrupt at the top of the second.)

</I>&gt;<i> The code in question was introduced by Haakan Johansson's commit of
</I>&gt;<i> Sat Nov 13 15:12:40 2010 +0100, explained as &quot;Allow oncore devices in

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This commit has already caused Gary Miller and myself concrete
</I>&gt;<i> problems as we attempted to disentangle the PPS support from the core
</I>&gt;<i> fix-processing logic.  The more general problem is that the commit
</I>&gt;<i> grossly violates gpsd's internal rules about how the daemon is
</I>&gt;<i> layered.  From the top down, the layers look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) The dispatcher layer.  This mainly consists of gpsd.c plus several
</I>&gt;<i> modules for generating and parsing JSON. Its job is to manage socket
</I>&gt;<i> communications with gpsd clients.  The bad code does not touch this layer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (2) The core-library layer.  The dispatcher calls this.  A couple
</I>&gt;<i> other tools that aren't the daemon use it as well, notably gpsmon and
</I>&gt;<i> gpsctl. Its job is to manage communications with one or more sensors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (3) The driver layer.  This is a library of drivers for different
</I>&gt;<i> sensor types, including not just GPSes but Marine AIS radios and RTCM
</I>&gt;<i> sources.  Each driver is encapsulated as a method structure (struct
</I>&gt;<i> gps_type_t) intentionally analogous to a Unix device-driver
</I>&gt;<i> definition.  This method structure contains all the methods and data
</I>&gt;<i> fields that a driver exports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each sensor managed by the core library has a session structure
</I>&gt;<i> (struct gps_device_t) which holds all the information the core library
</I>&gt;<i> needs to control it and interpret its take.  That session structure
</I>&gt;<i> includes a pointer to a driver type structure (struct gps_type_t).
</I>&gt;<i> All access by the core-library layer to the driver layer is supposed
</I>&gt;<i> to go through a device's type pointer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bad code violates two rules.  First, it adds if-guards to the core
</I>&gt;<i> library which explicitly check to see if a sessions's type pointer points
</I>&gt;<i> ast the OnCore method table, as a condition of performing special actions.
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, it adds code that refers to storage in the OnCore member
</I>&gt;<i> of the driver private union.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bad code breaks down the intended separation between the core-library
</I>&gt;<i> and driver layers.  It is intended that a driver exports information only
</I>&gt;<i> by modifying storage accessible from the session structure of a device, but
</I>&gt;<i> *not in the driver private union* - that is strictly for driver-private
</I>&gt;<i> state information.  The bad code directly references two members in the
</I>&gt;<i> OnCore driver private union.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This can't be tolerated, because layer violations like this will reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the core library to a pile of driver-specific hacks that is
</I>&gt;<i> effectively impossible to modify.  That's not an abstract theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> objection; Gary Miller and I have already felt this pain in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bad code serves an OnCore running in a special time-service mode,
</I>&gt;<i> and is trying to do two things that don't fit the present driver
</I>&gt;<i> model.  One is pass timestamps to NTP even though the device may never
</I>&gt;<i> have seen a good position fix, bypassing a guard that looks for at
</I>&gt;<i> least three continuous fixes from all devices.  The other is some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of manipulation of the NTP fudge and sample data that I
</I>&gt;<i> don't comprehend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The correct thing to do when the driver method interface is too confining
</I>&gt;<i> is to *extend that interface*, not violate the interface rules in an
</I>&gt;<i> ad-hoc way.  This code violates the design rules described in the
</I>&gt;<i> Hacking Guide; it should never even have been submitted, let alone
</I>&gt;<i> signed off on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have those rules for a reason. GPSD is used in potentially
</I>&gt;<i> life-critical navigation systems. We must maintain proper
</I>&gt;<i> orthogonality and layering in order to minimize our defect rate. Clean
</I>&gt;<i> code is not just an esthetic luxury; if the GPSD codebase degrades into
</I>&gt;<i> a brittle pile of hacks, that failure could *kill* people.
