<PRE>Subject to my work schedule, since I need to eat :)

I'm willing, but it means a fundamental change in the structures - rip
out the doubles and replace them with (32 bit?) ints.  Then do you
want to do 100 nanoDegrees or microDegrees (the former is about 1cm).

I think I could fully rework the minimalist NMEA without too much
problem once I figure out how to build it, and start taking stabs at
the rest of the infrastructure, but there is a lot external and all of
it breaks once the structures are changed.

The problem with leaving things as doubles is that now the entire,
larger codebase assumes double instead of int.

Other than possible future precision improvements which I don't see
coming for another decade, I don't think keeping things as doubles
provides any functionality.  The code appears simpler until you try to
remove library calls to simplify the parsing (I could have used atoi
in many places too, but I tried for the shortest and fastest forms
necessary).

On a non-FPU processor, you really need this change, so I will just
throw the question out to the discussion (or perhaps it should be a
new topic for the next rev).

What I need from a gpsd to work in embedded:

1. No floating point or other big libraries.  This might or might not
mean NMEA only, but from the binary formats I've seen it isn't that
hard to do fixed point parsing.

2. I need to be able to type &quot;make -f Makefile.gpsdmini&quot; instead of
requiring the entire GNU autobuild environment.  Even if the binary is
a bit chubby (I suggested drivers as plugins earlier) memory is rarely
a limit and you can -DNMEA_ONLY if it comes to that.  Nothing but -lc,
i.e. the implicit link path, or maybe one or two if they are cross
system and really needed, but I can't think of any.  No libtool,
automake, autoconf, or the rest should be necessary for gpsd itself.
I could do this too once I see how to do a minimalist
makefile/config.h.

3. An API for interleaving events or other sensor data.  I can have
another interface picking up other data, but if the line of text comes
in before the GPS line of text, it needs to go out, send the event, or
otherwise coordinate with it.  For example, my dashboard app needs
engine RPM.  I could pull everything separately and merge it but each
app would have to do that.  Maybe a driver_xeno.c that just opens a
listen/read socket and provides text strings out the JSON if a watch
is set.  I don't need much, but I do need a way to merge and sync
data.  (I'm assuming the multiple source GPS and failover is already
there).  If this is decided, it might clear up trouble on whether to
include some of the other data GPS devices provide which aren't nav
data like water temp.  Anything not in the main nav structure becomes
available through a standard catch-all method.

There may be a few more subtle things, e.g. if you have a bluetooth
datafeed, it might not correspond to the current device model, but
those should be easily solvable.

And yes, I would prefer to get gpsd-ng down to embedded size rather
than doing a separate codebase.
