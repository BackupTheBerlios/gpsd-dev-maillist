The largest problem I have with the method is you still need the write
barrier, otherwise you would have to use mask &amp; (cnt-1) for the reader
all the time since the payload might be propagating after the count is
updated without it.  It is minimal but still requires it.

And I've been searching, but I can't even find a clear way to do
barriers in Linux (hand-coding assembler for individual architectures
is as close as I can get).

Maybe someone should file an enhancement request (bug reqport) for
GCC, or maybe glibc.  I don't think the iTanium sync extensions are
there for all multicore architectures, and the problem occurs in any
multi threaded application.  Or maybe we need a libbarrier.  Or even
official system calls in the supported OSes.

And I just found <A HREF="http://developer.intel.com/Assets/PDF/manual/253668.pdf">http://developer.intel.com/Assets/PDF/manual/253668.pdf</A>

Chapter 8 is worth a read, and it may solve both.  8.2  begins the discussion.

But the key is 8.4.1:

The memory-ordering model respects the follow principles:
1. Stores within a single string operation may be executed out of order.
2. Stores from separate string operations (for example, stores from consecutive
string operations) do not execute out of order. All the stores from an
earlier string
operation will complete before any store from a later string operation.
3. String operations are not reordered with other store operations.

So if we can just force the fast inline string operations for the
sentinels and payload and do them in the right order, they will imply
memory barriers on x86.
