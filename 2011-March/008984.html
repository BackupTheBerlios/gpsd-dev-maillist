I think you can delete &quot;those files&quot;, depending on where they are or
how secure they are since they are just a filesystem node and you are
only doing an exclusive flag with an ioctl after the open, not locking
the inode.

Also don't assume they are in /dev or otherwise owned by root.  I
might also be able to grab the datastream from a pty with just a cat
command since you don't open those exclusively (the EXCL isn't set,
but it might be, just the &quot;is opened elsewhere already&quot; could be
dropped for a pty).

&gt;<i> Note that if you were actually to come up with a sneak path I would
</I>&gt;<i> become much less hostile to channel numbers, since that vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> would create a *requirement* for a layer of indirection to mask the
</I>&gt;<i> filenames.
</I>
A bit contrived, but off the top of my head, assume you have an
otherwise secure system behind an ethernet switch but I'm somewhere on
the net where I can access the gpsd port and I do an ordinary WATCH or
POLL.  I see the udp or tcp URI, say the actual GPS source is an
embedded device on the roof or outside with a wifi or ethernet
connection.  UDP is now simple as I can probably inject packets and
even take over the stream.  TCP is a bit more subtle, but I now also
know another address which is active, so can play games with ARP, even
if switches or something like WPK2 was active.

It would also let me tell if I was chrooted - I should see the device
node gpsd is connected with in my tree if I'm not.

Another things is the device name buffer is 64 bytes.  I don't think
the strlcpy is pre-checked by strlen when you do:

   if (device != NULL)
        (void)strlcpy(session-&gt;gpsdata.dev.path, device,
                      sizeof(session-&gt;gpsdata.dev.path));

The problem is if the desired node is beyond 63 bytes, and the 63 byte
path is valid, it will attempt to open whatever the path does point to
- a directory most likely but it might do something unexpected.  You
could use the return from strlcpy:

if( strlen(device) != strlcpy... )
  error_handle();

Oh, while hunting around...

sys/un.h:
/* Structure describing the address of an AF_LOCAL (aka AF_UNIX) socket.  */
struct sockaddr_un
  {
    __SOCKADDR_COMMON (sun_);
    char sun_path[108];         /* Path name.  */
  };
gpsd.c:
    (void)strlcpy(addr.sun_path, filename, 104);        /* from sys/un.h */

It happens to be greater by 4, but wouldn't sizeof(addr.sun_path) be
better?  Especially if any system had less than 104 bytes to the
buffer?

I could keep looking and will think about the &quot;on the same system&quot; and
&quot;what can I glean from gpsd on a remote system&quot; some more.  I'll look
more at the code too...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a bit disjoint, and the other drivers aren't likely to be much better.

</I>&gt;<i> There is some per-device variation, true. &#160;Not much we can do about
</I>&gt;<i> that; we're limited to reporting or computing from what the device

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's your metric of &quot;consistency'? &#160;If you come up with a convincing

</I>
I will have to think about that - I have to anyway for NMEA and the
GP/GL/GNxxx stuff which will be seriously painful to map right now.
I'll see if I can come up with a good mapping, then I may need to
investigate the other device drivers.

And speaking of 50Mhz Sparc, it turns out that the Venus 628 (and
others of that family) use the sparc core and run at 50Mhz and there
is a devkit.

I'm going to add it to the eval board order if it isn't prohibitively expensive.
