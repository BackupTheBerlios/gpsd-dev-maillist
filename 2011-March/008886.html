Thank you for pointing that out, Hakan.  The version of gpsd source I
glanced at did not clear valid.

I am not suggesting changing the interpretation or protocol of mode 0
or mode 1, but in an imaginary mode 2 with volatile keywords on all
the shm members, I think we can safely share the memory relying only
on 32-bit operations on count being atomic.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure valid is achieving anything. &#160;Readers don't read when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's zero, but that seems redundant to me with the count checking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also I don't like the reader resetting valid to 0 -- that shuts down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the possibility of multiple readers, and for what gain?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably to avoid using the same sample twice? &#160;But this can be checked by
</I>&gt;<i> either count, or the time-stamp itself. &#160;I also cannot see anything improved
</I>&gt;<i> by having the reader clear valid.
</I>
Agreed, we need to be sure to not use the same sample twice but valid
isn't the only way.

&gt;&gt;<i> valid is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cleared even when the reader abandoned the attempt because it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mid-update, which seems particularly ill-advised to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are missing volatile qualifiers, as far as I see, the shared
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory should be accessed solely through volatile pointers, as it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being modified by code outside the scope of the compiler's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimizations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To facilitate correctness and avoid duplication of code, I'd like to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see public header file lay out the structure and provide inline code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for producer and consumer. &#160;That would be eased by having not just one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structure, but a payload structure used by the producer and consumer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and a container structure with mode, count, and if needed, valid along
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with an embedded payload struct.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you believe we need both valid and count? &#160;Can you think of other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes or extensions that might be an improvement in some way?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One could use only count, if one in addition says that an odd count means
</I>&gt;<i> 'being updated' and an even count 'is valid'. &#160;To allow for a previous crash
</I>&gt;<i> during update, the increment before the update would ensure the count to be
</I>&gt;<i> odd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> count++;
</I>&gt;<i> count |= 1;
</I>&gt;<i> ... do updating ...
</I>&gt;<i> count++;
</I>
Assuming all the shared memory struct variables are declared volatile,
preventing the compiler from reordering accesses, I think we can
dispense with the odd/even concept as well, and simply rely on count's
update being atomic.  That does imply we need to allocate 64 bits for
count, so that access _is_ atomic on 64-bit, while using only the low
order 32 bits from 32-bit code.

&gt;<i> Also nice would be if the consumer (ntpd) would write some information of
</I>&gt;<i> its current status (stratum, active source, ... - basically what is in a NTP
</I>&gt;<i> network packet) to also allow the interface to be used for alternative
</I>&gt;<i> transmission methods, such as PPS-like over a serial line.
</I>
Feel free to prototype something.  It may be worthwhile to consider
this as a general ntpd capability not a feature restricted to
refclock_shm users.

Thanks,
Dave Hart
