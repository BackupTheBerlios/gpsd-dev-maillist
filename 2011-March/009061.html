</I>
My error, partially because the algorithm uses TWO flags and I
probably confused location and time.

In the two followups I have what i think you were trying to get at,
but the writer can modify the payload visible to the system before the
initial flag was altered even if it was written first, but without a
write barrier, so the reader could read both flags as the same (even
with a read barrier) and yet get a partially altered payload.  You
need TWO write barriers and TWO corresponding read barriers and still
have to move in the opposite direction.

&gt;<i> If you have any pointers I'd be grateful!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reader has no knowledge of when the writer executes the barrier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instruction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reader would have to do the write-sync barrier instruction, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the writer might still be active and the memory changing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, if there is only a single buffer, then you need much more complicated
</I>&gt;<i> lockouts, this is one of the things that 2^N buffers makes much easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just realized that with a single counter updated once per item, you cannot

</I>&gt;<i> the writer might be in the process of overwriting the current buffer you're

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I.e. with two buffers the counter must be the same before and after the
</I>&gt;<i> read, with 4 buffers it can have incremented up to two times etc:
</I>
But you still need write barriers unless the buffer size is a large
multiple of the cache size (several megs today!) AND you actually
force a write for every byte of the buffer (even if data is identical
and make sure it is forced in that case).

Your really delayed read ecc memory case might apply so it gets a
really, really stale counter, or multiple readers on different cores
get different counters.

Otherwise it merely lowers the probability, not unlike the bookend
consistency.  Otherwise sched_yield() would work in place of the read
barriers as it should take enough time for things to be pushed..
