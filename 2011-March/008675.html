First, I didn't know until your message it would be possible to build
such a version.  I might try, but I know I don't have anything to do
libtool for MIPS.

There are a bunch of options to disable things and I'm not sure which
are features and which are protocols.  there is no --minimalist
option, and there is nothing that I can find describing how I would
build what you are specifically talking about.

I am more efficient because I have highly optimized parser code.  The
NMEA output is a short string of integer characters  Everything else
has a very short path..

for minigpsd, I was using shared memory, so I could just open and
overlay the section and updates would be instantaneous - and no
message passing or repackaging.

Even in the makefile, I had CFLAGS += `pkgconfig...&quot; for gconf instead
of the autogen stuff, and maemo uses debian packaging.

&gt;<i> I think I understand about the FP issue. &#160;In an NMEA-only GPSD build I
</I>&gt;<i> think the only FP would be in the error-modeling code and the handling

</I>&gt;<i> cheerfully help with this.
</I>
No, right at the top of driver_nmea.c where it picks out the lat/lon:

        (void)sscanf(p, &quot;%lf&quot;, &amp;lat);
        m = 100.0 * modf(lat / 100.0, &amp;d);
        lat = d + m / 60.0;
        p = field[1];
        if (*p == 'S')
            lat = -lat;
        out-&gt;latitude = lat;

It would be intertesting to compare ncycles - I keep everyting in
micro-degrees (could go to tenth-of if any hardware was that
accurate).  You call sscanf using floats, use modf, and everyting is
float.  In NMEA.

mine is (note no library calls, why subs are included):

static int get2(char *c)
{
    int i = 0;
    if (*c)
        i = (*c++ - '0') * 10;
    if (*c)
        i += *c - '0';
    return i;
}
static int getminutes(char *d)
{
    int i;
    i = (*d++ - '0') * 100000;
    //Minutes with decimal
    i += (*d++ - '0') * 10000;
    if (*d)
        d++;
    if (*d)
        i += (*d++ - '0') * 1000;
    if (*d)
        i += (*d++ - '0') * 100;
    if (*d)
        i += (*d++ - '0') * 10;
    if (*d)
        i += *d++ - '0';
    return i * 5 / 3;
}
...
    c = field[f++];
    l = get2(c);
    c += 2;
    d = getminutes(c);

    c = field[f++];
    l *= 1000000;
    l += d;
    if (*c != 'N')
        l = -l;
...
If you need mine back as a float, f=l;f/=1000000.0;  FPUs use more
power even if you clean up the original

If I could actually build it without going through the whole autogen
process, I would.  If I don't want to bother with the libs, I still
need libtool to satisfy autogen.sh, and I can't get anything to
configure or set up the build environment without autogen.sh, unless
I'm missing something.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking at both that and webgpsd now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The current work in progress - it uses HTML5 canvas to show the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> satellite status page and a few other things. &#160;I've been busy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waiting for the feature freeze, and need to get to work (it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiplexes multiple GPS sources as well as other data to log). &#160;I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really need to do something about the security, but I need to verify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the featureset first: &#160;For now the multiple GPSes come from Python
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts, e.g. the bluetooth version even does pairing, and there is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> log-replay feeder.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/tz1/webgpsd">https://github.com/tz1/webgpsd</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're determined to reimplement I can't prevent it, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> But GPSD is designed to be stripped down to a very small set of
</I>&gt;<i> running gears for NMEA-only devices; I wish you'd work with us to
</I>&gt;<i> tighten up and slim down that build, rather than duplicating a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> our effort.
</I>
Your build environment is already on the huge model.  I would have
prefered to strip down gpsd-ng, but it is already well too complex for
me to sort out.  All that external build bloat is there even if I
could get the result to be similarly efficient.  ./autogen.sh to make
takes longer than make to binary.

As I've shown, you are using libraries and floats everywhere.  We're
talking extreme liposuction.

&gt;<i> Do you know about Gypsy? &#160;It too, was an attempt to ship a leaner, meaner
</I>&gt;<i> GPSD replacement. It was a technical success at its (necessarily) more
</I>&gt;<i> limited goals, but an uptake failure. &#160;There was pro-forma
</I>&gt;<i> support for it put into in a couple of projects like OpenMoko from
</I>&gt;<i> back around when Gypsy launched in 2008, but AFAIK nobody's actually
</I>&gt;<i> using it for production. The last code commit was eleven months ago.
</I>
I doubt the update on minimalist NMEA-only gpsd is any higher as I'm
on the devlist and read the docs and this is the first I've heard of
it.  Most distros probably just use the defaults or nearso.

&gt;<i> Gypsy stalled out for several reasons. &#160;One is that GPSD has a level
</I>&gt;<i> of name recognition and a reliability track record that's tough for
</I>&gt;<i> any new competitor to match. Another is that the application domain is
</I>&gt;<i> so replete with hardware quirks and protocol black art that it puts a
</I>&gt;<i> *very* heavy premium on kinds of domain experience that new projects
</I>&gt;<i> can't readily duplicate. &#160;A third is our test infrastructure; more
</I>&gt;<i> than half the problem is demonstrating that the code is correct and
</I>&gt;<i> keeping it stable against the tendency to bitrot.
</I>
Windows and iPod have better name recognition.  In the case of the
latter webgpsd can run on a jailbroken version with a 3rd party
BTStack.

There is a limit to how far NMEA can go with quirks and work at all.
The other information (e.g. water depth) I consider out of scope for
what I'm trying to do.  I don't think of myself as a competitor

&gt;<i> When I look at minigpsd/webgpsd, I see the second coming of Gypsy.
</I>&gt;<i> You clearly have some good ideas, and you've chosen a mission that a
</I>&gt;<i> full-featured GPSD build is probably too heavyweight for. &#160;But, honestly, I
</I>&gt;<i> think you're likely to stall out in the same way Gypsy did.
</I>
The mission dates from 5 years ago.  As I've noted, I'm not seeking to
replace gpsd-ng for what it does - it is heavyweight for a reason, but
especially on the build level.

The other half is I can't use gpsd-ng since I can't (and probably will
 never be able to) inline external data.  You will have water depth or
whatever merged into the info stream, but I can't merge my engine rpm
and fuel consumption data.  I have other sensors, some might get
adopted, others not.  I need multiple redundant failover GPSes but one
master value.

And I have to be able to log all this data in a format where I can
find the interesting portions.

&gt;<i> It would be better for everyone if we co-opted each other. &#160;There's
</I>&gt;<i> precedent; the lead dev of another GPSD competitor, ngpsd, was welcomed
</I>&gt;<i> here and active for several years. &#160;He decided ngpsd was unnecessary,
</I>&gt;<i> and we still have the specialized client he wrote under maintainance.
</I>
&gt;<i> You'd get the GPSD test infrastructure, which is no trivial thing.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to have your Bluetooth-pairing and HTML5 support. &#160;More
</I>&gt;<i> generally, I'd *love* to have a dev on the project who cares day-to-day
</I>&gt;<i> about the low-power embedded stuff - I want to cover those devices,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't have the right hardware-test setup to do it.
</I>
I'd love to, but right now wth the build environment, it is like
saying move to C++ from C.

Also, even if I did - and I might take a look with your help and
comments - I don't see the necessary features being in gpsd-ng, so I
have to write my version anyway.

It is GPLv3, so anyone here should feel free to study and port it, and
I am willing to provide help and probably take steps after the startup
after the current freeze-release cycle.

&gt;<i> Gypsy was a well-intentioned waste of talent. Please, let's work together
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid another such.
