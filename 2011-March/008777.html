It isn't GNU libc, but I think I can suggest that the POSIX calls all
be supported, maybe even the pthreads since it is in the standard.

That should include all recent flavors of unix - both the BSD
derivatives and linux flavors, but even embedded libc versions.
Probably even Cygwin.

I don't think that a system without string.h and stdio.h and the BSD
socket interface will work anyway.

&gt;<i> &#160;libc. &#160;What are you doing that is so weird that it REQUIRES going

</I>&gt;<i> the hairy toolchain for the man pages. &#160;Probably I left some things out.
</I>
Lots of these things are for the library and not the daemon proper and
I seem not to be making this point clearly.

None of the devices I want to use gpsd on will require the library, at
least not for most applications (I can and did get Xvnc on the chumby
hacker board and it was glacial but worked).  A swiss army knife is at
first a knife, and I want just the knife, not the magnifier,
corkscrew, and tweezers.

Perhaps my biggest package annoyance with bluez is that it typically
requires bluez-gnome in the dependencies for PIN support, so even if
there is nothing else requiring a GUI, the entire Gnome desktop and
down is brought in.  That is the effect.

One of my ultimate targets is the Atmel architecture that DOES NOT
HAVE ANY OPERATING SYSTEM.  AT ALL.  But it has a fairly complete GNU
toolchain.  The only missing part would be the network stuff which I
would have to figure out how to use a serial-to-ethernet (e.g. wifly)
device or one of the mini TCP stacks and network shield.

To get JSON position strings from a plain serial port - even a
bluetooth /dev/rfcomm, you don't require python, libusb, c++, Qt, or a
lot of other things.  If there are problematic calls like strlcpy, I
would write my own function or use another, different way that was
independent.

&gt;<i> Your board sounds like something that you would want a working cross
</I>&gt;<i> environment for anyway.
</I>
I have a working cross environment, but it isn't that useful since too
many packages use the autotools such that cross compiles are broken.

About the only place the autotools are reliable for actual cross
compilation is the GNU toolchain, but then they need to be in order to
bootstrap.

I could probably add the linux (and probably other os) kernel support
tools like insmod and mount for similar reasons.

It doesn't help having a cross environment if several major pieces
beyond gpsd that I require can't be built or even the prebuilt -dev
portions brought into where they are visible to the cross environment.

&gt;<i> You should go read what is done in configure.   See my previous message

</I>
as I noted, configure is 20000 lines.

&gt;<i> I can see wanting to replace auto* with something functionally

</I>
It is far more sane to edit a few lines at the top of a makefile than
to spend hours trying to get CC= CFLAGS=, and dozens of --enable-this
--disable-that --the-lib-is-really-here options just right and
spending several minutes on each ./configure attempt, and which often
dosen't even work without hacking the ./configure file itself, which
is far worse than any makefile I have seen.  And I've done it far too
many times.

Have you looked at linux kernel builds recently?  I can cross-build
to/from nearly anything with the minimal requirements I've asked for.
