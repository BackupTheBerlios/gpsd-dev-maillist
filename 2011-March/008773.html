Cross compiling always requires at least a minimal unpacked target
environment.  You need the .h files from the target, and need to ensure
that you don't use .h files from the host.  You need the libraries
present so the links can be tested.   And anything else for feature
tests.

The cross build is not particularly hairy - you just need a
compiler/assembler/linker toolchain.

Keep in mind that cross does not imply that the OS type and release is
the same from host to target.  This is about far more than matching
Linux versions; it should be possible to compile for Linux from BSD, and
vice versa, across arbitrary CPU combinations

(I realize autoconf uses build/host/target for the computer where you
build gcc, the computer where you run gcc, and the computer where you
run the binaries where gcc is produced, but I'm using host == the normal
&quot;place to build' and traget == &quot;place to run&quot; for non-compiler-type
cross builds.)

&gt;&gt;<i> build works on substantially any semi-reasonable platform, similar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to what it does now, and this includes things that gpsd developers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have never heard of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, but the key word is &quot;reasonable&quot;.  If you are only using some
</I>&gt;<i> flavor of libc to build gpsd, you shouldn't have to test for the
</I>&gt;<i> presence of each individual call, or if things are in strange places,
</I>&gt;<i> you would have to hack up autogen.sh anyway and that defeats the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose - it is easier to edit the top 20 lines of a makefile than to
</I>&gt;<i> hack any of these thousand line build scripts.
</I>
You keep asking for the upstream distribution to accomodate you at the
expense of others.  The design philosophy of autoconf, which I think it
definitely got right, is to test for features, not operating systems,
and then after a while the program under development will configure
correctly on platforms the author never heard of.

Again, one can argue that m4/sh is painful, and that there should be
some more abstracted approach.

&gt;&gt;<i> shared libraries are done in the correct way for each platform,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without gpsd having to define what that means
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, it produces correct shared and/or static libraries for the
</I>&gt;<i> platform using whichever way is convenient.  For a long time SSLeay
</I>&gt;<i> (predecessor to openssl) could be turned into a shared library by
</I>&gt;<i> simply doing &quot;ar x ../libssl.a&quot;, then a &quot;ld -shared... *.o&quot; in a
</I>&gt;<i> subdirectory.  No libtool needed.  Everything else compiled and linked
</I>&gt;<i> with the libssleay[vers].so without problems.
</I>
Point taken that on platforms with no shared library support just
making a static library is fine

You are again failing to understand that all the world is not linux.
There is no POSIX spec that says &quot;ld -shared *.o&quot; will work, and it
doesn't work in many places.  libtool encapsulates the right way to
build and create shared libraries in lots of places.  Pretending that
complexity does not exist is naive or willfully myopic, but of course
another tool that also deals with that complexity in a cleaner way is an
entirely reasonable discussion.

&gt;&gt;<i> Note that I&quot;m not arguing against python as a build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependency. (Although I find objecting to auto* as too heavy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then being happy about python bizarre; objecting to auto* as fragile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is another matter, but it's not heavy.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ./configure as produced by ./autogen.sh is over 20000 lines.  I doubt
</I>&gt;<i> anything in Python will be 1/10th the length or take more than 1/10th
</I>&gt;<i> the time.
</I>
You left out the size of python; that was my point.
