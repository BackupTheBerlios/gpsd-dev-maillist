<PRE>Recently there's been more discussion than usual of higher-level
questions about the direction of GPSD - whether we need a plugin
architecture, the merits of breaking apart the packet sniffer, what
would be entailed in becoming FP-free, that sort of thing.

I want to say that I have really enjoyed this and wish there were much 
more of it!
 
I may have good reasons to reject architecture ideas, as I did with
plugins, but I much prefer being regularly challenged in that way to
feeling like nobody is paying attention to that level of the design
but me.

There's a lot of talent among our contributors.  I think I'm a pretty
good systems architect, but I don't suffer from the delusion that I'm
*always* the smartest guy in the room.  Keep that conversation alive, 
please; question our assumptions, spin out deployment scenarios that
will stress our code and tools, push me to think!

I will be grateful for it.
