<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> No, both sources could be on the public internet.  One of gpsd's
</I>&gt;<i> function is to publish information.
</I>
You can be spoofed if you're not using IPsec.  This is not breaking news,
nor is it GPSD's problem to solve.

&gt;<i> You aren't building TLS as an option (The AUTHENTICATION is more
</I>&gt;<i> important than the encryption - I can't require valid certs for
</I>&gt;<i> sources, nor validate I'm talking to the real gpsd at the remote end).
</I>
Yeah, I looked into adding authentication a while back in order to 
prevent DOSes via the commands for changing baud rate or cycle.  It would
have required tremendously complicating the app interface, so I didn't do it.

&gt;<i> And if your &quot;open exclusive&quot; code is working, stty won't, at least not
</I>&gt;<i> while gpsd is connected and if you aren't root.
</I>
Um, what &quot;open exclusive&quot;?  I *wish* we could do that.  

&gt;<i> But the names aren't unique.  I haven't set it up far enough to
</I>&gt;<i> actually get DEVICE json sentences back, but if it worked they would
</I>&gt;<i> be identical.
</I>
Right, since you tested this you know it actually works.  We don't rely
*internally* on device names being distinct.  The only place it 
matters is if clients want to set a &quot;device&quot; filtering option, or
filter in the client.

Which is actually a half-forgotten reason I've been resisting your
push for channel numbers (I *knew* I had one other than incremental
code complexity!).  There are two possible design cases here:

Transparent channel numbers: You can get the channel -&gt; device map
via ?DEVICES:  Or, opaque channel numbers - you can't get the device 
name at all.

Transparent channel numbers give you the information you need to 
use filtering if, for example, you have two sensors in fixed locations
at either end of an oil tanker.  (Real use case from one of our users!)
But they have all the problems of leaking information that you describe.

Opaque channel numbers prevent information leaks, but make device filtering
a pain in the ass.

As always, we have to choose in the presence of tradeoffs. Transaprent
channel numbers would just be premature optimization, not addressing
any security issue; I reject those outright. Opaque channel numbers 
might help in some unlikely situations, but hinder real users with
real use cases. You'd have to convince me that the risk from those
information leaks is more weighty than the increased complexity cost to
real users, and so far I'm nowhere within a light-year of persuaded.

&gt;<i> &gt; Have you ever in your entire life seen a serial device name that was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 63 chars long? &#160;No, better: have you ever even seen one that was *16*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chars long?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Daily.  Right now.  On my Mac OSX.  For any bluetooth device, it
</I>&gt;<i> creates /dev/tty.(bluetooth-friendly-name)-SPP  (or -Modem... SPPslave
</I>&gt;<i> etc.), and the friendly name of one of my devices is 20 characters
</I>&gt;<i> long by itself.  None of this is contrived.
</I>
Thanks for the education.  None of this pushes the actual buffer-size limit, 
though.

For detailed discussion of why devicename truncation doesn't worry me,
see my reply to Dave Hart.

&gt;<i> /dev/./././. - ./ttyUSB11 can be truncated to ttyUSB1 and the open
</I>&gt;<i> will SUCCEED on the truncated name.
</I>
And then fail to sync - and toss USB1 out of the device pool -  unless 
it's a GPS too.

&gt;<i> You said the code had to be as safe as possible or practical, yet
</I>&gt;<i> there are a lot of unchecked and unprotected things throughout.
</I>
Produce evidence for &quot;a lot&quot; rather than simply asserting it, please.
We are scrupulously careful about strlcpy()/strcat()/vnsprintf(), 
forbid malloc() in the daemon, use splint for static checking, and
in general quite paranoid.

&gt;<i> So which is it, if the user is stupid or doesn't use enough external
</I>&gt;<i> security, well gpsd wasn't designed to be safe, or gpsd is supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> be designed to be as safe as possible from both stupidity and malice?
</I>
gpsd is designed to be as safe as I think is practical, under a constraint
you're not thinking about enough.

Armoring against really outside failure cases has a complexity cost.
When you push hard enough, you reach a region where the additional 
complexity of the armor raises your defect rate more than ignoring
the supposed problem would.

My objective is to push gpsd to the edge of that region *and not into it*.
 
&gt;<i> If someone malicious tries hard and does break gpsd's assumptions,
</I>&gt;<i> they might be able to do more harm than you can expect.  I've found a
</I>&gt;<i> few things in just a cursory glance of the code and I'm not looking
</I>&gt;<i> for problems and won't try fuzzing (I think gpsctl is run as root, so
</I>&gt;<i> if it isn't unidirectional and I can buffer-overflow, root!  - I just
</I>&gt;<i> have to kill gpsd and set up a malicous version).  That is why I don't
</I>&gt;<i> like loose ends like these.  It isn't only friendly, noob, or strange
</I>&gt;<i> case users that you have to worry about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm rooting for gpsd to be more secure :).
</I>
Good. By all means keep pushing. Expect to win sometimes, but not always.
