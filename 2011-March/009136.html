This is x86 Total Store Order (TSO) which is amongst the strongest 
cross-cpu guarantees on any architecture.

As we've been discussing, other architectures, with DEC Alpha as the 
worst (?) offender basically doesn't enforce any ordering at all without 
at least a barrier between the two stores.

This is probably also why gcc on x86 seems to make the __sync_* 
operation a No-Op: What it really does is to be an optimizer barrier, so 
that neither stores nor loads can be moved across the sync location.

&quot;almost all programming can be viewed as an exercise in caching&quot;
