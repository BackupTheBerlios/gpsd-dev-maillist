&gt;<i> Looking at the aggregate-to-fix algorithm, it doesn't seem very
</I>&gt;<i> robust.  You would appear to get a new fix if the others were damaged
</I>&gt;<i> but GGA was the ender and it got through.
</I>
Possibly.  This is not a case we've ever seen in the wild.

&gt;<i> I think it would work better if it would first accumulate the bitmap
</I>&gt;<i> of the complete set of identical times, then emit the fix only when
</I>&gt;<i> the same set of bits are set - clearing the field if the fixtime
</I>&gt;<i> changes.
</I>&gt;<i> So if you had RMC/GLL/GGA initially or after a few cycles, you would
</I>&gt;<i> require all three with the same fixtime to update the fix.  You can't
</I>&gt;<i> misidentify an &quot;ender&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would produce fewer fixes, e.g. if RMC updates at rate 2, GLL at
</I>&gt;<i> 3, and GGA at 5, but if a GPS is set that way you really can't do
</I>&gt;<i> anything else.
</I>
Right.  I suspect the reason the aggregate-to-fix algorithm looks robust
to us and fragile to you is that, in the consumer grade of hardware we're used
to testing, cycle behavior is very stereotyped.   I don't think we've *ever*
seen a case where RMC, GLL, and GLL were being emitted at different rates,
though some of the devices we support do have that as a theoretical
capability.  Closest we've come to it is one really old Garmin that 
emitted RMC and GLL in asymmetrical half-cycles.

If you think you can harden the driver to behave sanely in that case, go
ahead.  We've got enough wacky NMEA-variant test loads that I'm willing to
have drastic things done to that driver in confidence that we can test
for introduced bugs *very* thoroughly.
