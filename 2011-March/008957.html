I assume this is a broadcast mechanism - gpsd writes, any number of
clients read.

Also, is the data going to be NOFLOAT?  The internal structures are
one thing but if you are going to do a shared memory segment, it will
have to be one or the other.

Semaphores are the most obvious mechanism but it starts to defeat the
simplicity of using a SHM.  You need both the readers and writers to
use the semaphore, and you have to do it so readers won't block the
writer nor each other, at least not for very long, and that gets
tricky.  Linux's RCU mechanism doesn't have a user analog I've found.

The way I did it for the Nokia tablets (so my instrument cluster could
pick out speed, direction, etc whenever without blicking) is to use
the 32 bit integers for everything so reads were atomic, and use a
memory mapped file (mmap.h).  I did it with an actual file in /tmp,
but it should be just as doable with a file descriptor from a named
shm from shm_open.

I would do an lseek to 0 then a write of the entire structure in the
daemon - this would update the mapped page atomically since it was
smaller than a page or sector (multicore might be a problem, but the
shm usage was noncritical).  The readers would have the file mmaped to
a local structure (python made this really easy).  On a processor with
native floating point (so it reads the float or double atomically) you
could use those instead of the 32 bit integers.

(quick explanation - I could do userland memcpy to the memory segment,
but that is interruptable whereas the internal memcpy in the OS write
won't be, at least not in a way that will leave it partially written
for a reader).

There can still be problems since it is volatile, but the routines
would need to check if anything changes, e.g. number of satellites.
Conversely, the readers could also do the lseek and read() and get the
data atomically.
