<PRE>While attempting a cleanup on the PPS logic I encountered some code committed
by Jon Schleuter on behalf of Haakan Johansson that is utterly wrong and
must be fixed or entirely removed from gpsd.

 I'm going to explain in detail what is wrong with it, because I
*never* want to see a patch this evil submitted or (worse) signed off
on *ever again*.  I haven't yet decided whether to rip it out immediately
or wait a few days for a fix patch; I'm leaning towards &quot;immediately&quot; and
it may have been done by the time you read this.

The code in question was introduced by Haakan Johansson's commit of
Sat Nov 13 15:12:40 2010 +0100, explained as &quot;Allow oncore devices in
postion hold mode to deliver PPS data to ntpshm&quot; and signed off by
Jon Schleuter.  

This commit has already caused Gary Miller and myself concrete
problems as we attempted to disentangle the PPS support from the core
fix-processing logic.  The more general problem is that the commit
grossly violates gpsd's internal rules about how the daemon is
layered.  From the top down, the layers look like this:

(1) The dispatcher layer.  This mainly consists of gpsd.c plus several
modules for generating and parsing JSON. Its job is to manage socket
communications with gpsd clients.  The bad code does not touch this layer.

(2) The core-library layer.  The dispatcher calls this.  A couple
other tools that aren't the daemon use it as well, notably gpsmon and
gpsctl. Its job is to manage communications with one or more sensors.

(3) The driver layer.  This is a library of drivers for different
sensor types, including not just GPSes but Marine AIS radios and RTCM
sources.  Each driver is encapsulated as a method structure (struct
gps_type_t) intentionally analogous to a Unix device-driver
definition.  This method structure contains all the methods and data
fields that a driver exports.

Each sensor managed by the core library has a session structure
(struct gps_device_t) which holds all the information the core library
needs to control it and interpret its take.  That session structure
includes a pointer to a driver type structure (struct gps_type_t).
All access by the core-library layer to the driver layer is supposed
to go through a device's type pointer.

The bad code violates two rules.  First, it adds if-guards to the core 
library which explicitly check to see if a sessions's type pointer points
ast the OnCore method table, as a condition of performing special actions.
Secondly, it adds code that refers to storage in the OnCore member 
of the driver private union.

The bad code breaks down the intended separation between the core-library
and driver layers.  It is intended that a driver exports information only 
by modifying storage accessible from the session structure of a device, but
*not in the driver private union* - that is strictly for driver-private 
state information.  The bad code directly references two members in the 
OnCore driver private union.

This can't be tolerated, because layer violations like this will reduce
the core library to a pile of driver-specific hacks that is
effectively impossible to modify.  That's not an abstract theoretical
objection; Gary Miller and I have already felt this pain in this case.

The bad code serves an OnCore running in a special time-service mode,
and is trying to do two things that don't fit the present driver
model.  One is pass timestamps to NTP even though the device may never
have seen a good position fix, bypassing a guard that looks for at
least three continuous fixes from all devices.  The other is some
kind of manipulation of the NTP fudge and sample data that I
don't comprehend.

The correct thing to do when the driver method interface is too confining
is to *extend that interface*, not violate the interface rules in an
ad-hoc way.  This code violates the design rules described in the 
Hacking Guide; it should never even have been submitted, let alone
signed off on.

We have those rules for a reason. GPSD is used in potentially
life-critical navigation systems. We must maintain proper
orthogonality and layering in order to minimize our defect rate. Clean
code is not just an esthetic luxury; if the GPSD codebase degrades into
a brittle pile of hacks, that failure could *kill* people.
