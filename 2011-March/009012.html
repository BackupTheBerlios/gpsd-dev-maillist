I assume the process is:

Increment startguard.
alter payload
increment endguard.

&gt;<i> The reader's algorithm is simple: memcpy from the shared segment. &#160;If both

</I>
By correct, do you mean equal?

Anyway it won't work if memcpy is interruptable.

Reader starts the memcpy, copies the start sentinel and half the payload.
Writer increments the start sentinel. and writes into the payload.
Reader continues the memcpy where it left off through the end sentinel.

Both sentinels are equal, yet the bottom part of the payload is invalid.

If both sentinels are changed together, a memcpy will not detect it at all.

If the end sentinel is changed at the start the reader will have to go
in a forward direction.

&gt;<i> I believe all that is required for guaranteed correctness is that the
</I>&gt;<i> writer updates the storage bytes in the shared-memory segment in an
</I>&gt;<i> order that is either monotonic-increasing or monotonic-decreasing, and
</I>&gt;<i> the reader likewise reads bytes in a monotonic order.
</I>
That doesn't help.  In fact it would be better if they went in
opposite directions for the reasons stated above.

&gt;<i> Part of the reason I think this is an interesting technique is that I
</I>&gt;<i> believe the following: on essentially all modern processors, memcpy(3)
</I>&gt;<i> is optimized to a single-instruction bitblt that reads and updates
</I>&gt;<i> memory in a monotonic order (certainly this is true of naive C
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of memcpy()). Thus, it should be sufficient for the
</I>&gt;<i> writer to memcpy() into the struct and the reader to memcpy() out of
</I>&gt;<i> it. &#160;It doesn't matter whether or not memcpy() is interruptible.
</I>
nm .libs/lt-gpsd shows it is using memcpy from glibc, not optimizing it out.

In fact I can't get the current gcc to optimize ANYTHING in string.h
out - there might be a bug in /usr/include/bits or sys/bits - there
are a large number of #ifdef XYZ that if every one of them are set
right it should use the inline version of the functions, but I cannot
find any combinations of flags or optimizatinos that will guarantee
it.

The direction of memcpy is implementation dependent.

You could do
__inline__ function my_memcpy(u8 *d, u8 *s, uint32 l) { while( l-- )
*d++ = *c++; };
and it would probably work.  Even with optimization but without the inline.

The only way I can think of is a single writer sets a bool to safe to
read - unsafe to write, and a single reader sets it back to safe to
read - unsafe to write.
