<PRE>Michael R. Davis &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">mrdvt92 at yahoo.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Three Issues: 
</I>&gt;<i>   1) Extra /usr/lib64/libQgpsmm.prl file - assume that the /usr/lib64/libQgpsmm.prl file is supposed to be in the libQgpsmm package as opposed to a miss-installed file.
</I>
I think that's right.  I'll apply your patch to that affect to the repo.

&gt;<i>   2) Tilde not supported in file naming version.  Removed ~dev.   
</I>
Thast's going to happen when we ship.

&gt;<i>   3) RPM spec file &quot;Release&quot; should be reset to 1 after every release of the &quot;upstream&quot; package.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> Otherwise it worked and I have attached my work arounds below.  I have some patching to do with Perl(Net::GPSD3) as well to support new &quot;time&quot; format in JSON.
</I>
Good.  Note that the C and Python client libs accept either float or
ISO8601 timestamps, preserving backward compatibility; the Perl
binding should do likewise.

&gt;<i> Other issues:
</I>&gt;<i> It appears that none of the ./www file are being installed.  We could buld them into packages quite easily. Just let me know what you think people want.  I was actually thinking about putting together a smaple Perl script to put in the distro just to pull in the perl-Net-GPSD3 package.
</I>
The www files aremn't really intended to be installed.  They're the masters
for the project website.
 
&gt;<i> I also thought that we are going to split out gpsd-clients into gpsd-clients-cli and gpsd-clients-gui.  Do we want to do that now?
</I>
First I've heard of that idea.  I'm not actively opposed, but I don't think 
it's a big win either.
