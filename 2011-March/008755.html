<PRE>I find it hard to believe there's a world where python is easy and auto* is really hard, and for which it's important/rational to do native builds instead of cross.   Details of what it is would help.


I think requirements are:

   build can be done native or cross, without requiring execution of any target binaries.   This mean the qemu semi-cross build is not a good enough answer - even though it's fine if people want to do it that way.

  build works on substantially any semi-reasonable platform, similar to what it does now, and this includes things that gpsd developers have never heard of

  shared libraries are done in the correct way for each platform, without gpsd having to define what that means

  basic platform adaptation mechanisms are in place, as they are now

  there is no assumption that the python interpreter, in either host or target, is called python.  E.g., python2.6 should be fine.

and what we don't have:

  one can give switches to build without python *on the target* (ok, maybe we can do that)

  one can give switches so that the only programs which depend on python are installed, to ease making a split package of the python dependencies.

Note that I&quot;m not arguing against python as a build dependency.  (Although I find objecting to auto* as too heavy and then being happy about python bizarre; objecting to auto* as fragile is another matter, but it's not heavy.)
