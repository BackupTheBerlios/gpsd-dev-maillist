Debian's package based system almost forces pkg-config to be
available, but it will build and install the necessary pkg-config
entries when building those from source.

E.g. for ARM on the Nokia nSeries tablets and maemo, they use
scratchbox and qemu to feign being on a real ARM system.

Other systems can be problematic.  I don't have something equally good
for Fedora, and trying to build anything on my chumby hacker board
(ARM) is painful.

I find the whole autoconfig, libtool, and the rest to be a horrible
hack that should have been eliminated a decade ago, or at least cached
so that every freaking package - when it knows it has a very recent
glibc - doesn't try to figure out if it has memset or bzero - and
repeat the test every time ./configure fails, usually after several
minutes so each hiccup in the environment takes that long to retry.
Cross-compiles usually are broken even if you do all the ARCH= PREFIX=
stuff.

On my fairly vanilla recent linux distro that has to have gcc and
glibc, ./configure asks

checking for sys/types.h... yes
checking for sys/stat.h... yes
checking for stdlib.h... yes
checking for string.h... yes
checking for memory.h... yes
checking for strings.h... yes
checking for inttypes.h... yes
checking for stdint.h... yes
checking for unistd.h... yes

Somehow it might have strings.h and not unistd.h?  Single threaded, so
more cores won't speed it up.  And yes, I know every package does it,
which is why it takes days to rebuild source into binary for ARM if
you aren't cross compiling.  Every package has to test for itself if
on the glibc/linux system if it has string.h.

It is ugly, and probably won't work for ancient versions of obscure
operating systems, but maybe someone has an old Sparc 1 box...

The above is directly from ./autogen.sh.  I have bluez and bluetooth
GPSes but it decided to run ./configure anyway so I needed to go
through it again

At least it seems to cross-compile correctly in the base case, but it
doesn't do bluetooth.

But why this long rant?  Because this complex bloat isn't gong to be
present on most smaller, embedded systems.  Intentionally or not, the
build is already well past any possibility of standing alone.  It
won't build unless all these tools are there and I know of no plans to
split it into a simple daemon with interface that a simple and obvious
GCC command line will compile, and the big system stuff that needs
this.

So it is silly to talk as if this could ever be built on anything
small - i.e. somewhere that won't have libtool.  That has been
conceded.

I would also note the Linux kernel uses none of this, and manages to
build across a wider range of targets with a larger number of options.

I'm working on an a version of just gpsd targeted at embedded (and
plain NMEA only) and I don't even use floating point.  It can tell
firefox where it is and do a number of other things.  And it has a
Makefile.  So far it works on all the Posix/GCC systems I've tried,
and all the ARM processors - Don't forget that these are also battery
powered, and have limited space, so it isn't just building.  If
gpsd-ng as is uses 5% cpu, it will drain the battery quickly.
