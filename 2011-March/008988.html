<PRE>H&#229;kan Johansson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">f96hajo at chalmers.se</A>&gt;: 
&gt;<i> Yes, definately ugly.
</I>
I am glad you recognize this.

&gt;<i> The attached diff cleans libgpsd_core.c by removing the oncore
</I>&gt;<i> references inside libgpsd_core.c, without stripping out the support
</I>&gt;<i> functionality in the driver itself.
</I>
I think I have already figured out how to do most of this the right way.

First step: Introduce a new driver state flag PPSTIME_IS which signals that the
driver has returned a timestamp that it thinks can be treated as precision
time.  The Garmin driver, for example, wants to set this bit from  

       (3 &lt; session-&gt;context-&gt;fixcnt)

though as it turns out this expression is not quite right; the fix
count should be tracked per-device in case there are multiple ones.
The NMEA driver should count fixes like a Garmin in case what it's
talking to *is* a Garmin in NMEA mode. The OnCore driver wants to set
this if more than zero satellites are used in a time solution, rather
than counting fixes.

Other drivers can just set PPSTIME_IS when TIME_IS is set, pending
more information about whether they need stabilization time after a
cold boot. 

ntpd should be able to reject times that are wildly off, so getting
the stabilization period wrong shouldn't be a big deal.  Because of
this, it might be that no flag separate from TIME_IS is actually
required - but the incremental complexity cost of PPSTIME_IS is
low and gives us flexibility in case of exotic requirements.

Second step: Replace the guard on shipping PPS time to ntpd with

       ((session-&gt;gpsdata.valid &amp; PPSTIME_IS) != 0)

Now we get the effect of OnCore signaling that it thinks it has
precision time without violating the layering, because it's passing
out that information through the session status mask the way it's
supposed to.  

Furthermore, each driver can have its own rule for when this flag is
set.  And finally, we have removed a magic number (3) from the core
library.

&gt;<i>                            So that a proper solution can
</I>&gt;<i> be worked out without rush, but also not having to re-add that code.
</I>&gt;<i> (In position hold mode, an oncore will never deliver a position fix,
</I>&gt;<i> as it already has been told where it is.  Somehow this has to be
</I>&gt;<i> modelled, that it has a 'really' good time, without claiming a fix.)
</I>
Right.  This is the problem I think I have already solved.
 
&gt;<i> The (independent) use of pulse_delay_ns is also removed, while the
</I>&gt;<i> code potentially using it inside libgpsd_core.c is kept, as the ugly
</I>&gt;<i> is the way to get to the data, not the delay itself.  (An oncore
</I>&gt;<i> device can be told to delay the PPS pulse, thereby making it
</I>&gt;<i> possible to timestamp several gps modules on the same computer.
</I>&gt;<i> Multiple devices otherwise all make the interrupt at the top of the
</I>&gt;<i> second.)
</I>
I still don't quite understand that bit of code.  I will do as you recommend
and condition it out.  You can fix it when you have access to a live
device again.
