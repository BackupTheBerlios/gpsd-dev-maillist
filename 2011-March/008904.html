<PRE>Why is &quot;mode&quot; in TPV if it comes from GPGSA?  Shouldn't it or whatever
is in GPGSA be in SKY?  But you can derive mode from just the TPV
information.

Note you need either GPRMC or BOTH GPGLL AND GPZDA to get the date and
then there is the midnight rollover problem (5Hz garmins if nothing
else).  To get altitude, you need GPGGA.

The lat/lon sentences have the A/V flag which would correspond to mode
1 or &gt;1, and the number of satellites in GPGGA should give 2 or 3 for
2d or 3d fix (ignore the altitude if 2d), but I propose changing 3 to
4 if GPGGA also indicates DGPS is active.  I don't see anywhere else
this higher accuracy is indicated.  It isn't DoP, it means whatever
numbers are being reported are being corrected.  It could be its own
tag.

The set is lat/lon/validity, date, altitude/sats-2d3d/dgps, each with
time  TPV should go out at each complete set.  The particular
sentences aren't as important - if there is line noise, GPGLL/ZDA
could act as a backup for GPRMC.  You need to see GPRMC or GPZDA at
least once - but if it isn't a requirement, you need to have some code
to increment the date at the midnight cross (which could be part of
the midnight fix anyway).

There may be other combinations that give all the data, but if any
don't include time, then TPV would have to depend on bounding and
examining the entire frame and with arbitrary ordering, unless you are
looking for the interframe pause or something similar, it might be
very hard to tell which frame something without a time belongs to.
There is still the problem if they don't occur in every set of
sentences.

If GPGGA and GPRMC/(GPGLL+GPZDA) are not the same rate, you can still
only emit TPV when you get a complete set with the same time values.
