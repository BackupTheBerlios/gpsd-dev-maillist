<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The daemon occasionally ships a bare DEVICE object to the client
</I>&gt;<i> (that is, one not inside a DEVICES wrapper). The data content of these
</I>&gt;<i> objects will be described later in the section covering
</I>&gt;<i> notifications.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are bits and pieces in other sections, mostly not having
</I>&gt;<i> anything to do with notification, but no &quot;Notifications&quot; section as
</I>&gt;<i> such.
</I>
Looking....OK, that's a bad pointer, I've fixed it to reference the section
describing the response to ?DEVICE;

&gt;<i> One of the things I am trying to do is to figure out how to use
</I>&gt;<i> xhttpdrequest to get something from gpsd-ng - use an existing json
</I>&gt;<i> coder efficiently instead of writing up a new blob of json
</I>&gt;<i> specifically for it.  Part of that path is getting my version to emit
</I>&gt;<i> the same or very similar output and adjusting the javascript to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is where I find WATCH to have a problem.  You could simply dump
</I>&gt;<i> everything and allow the client to pick out the bits (as they are
</I>&gt;<i> clearly labeled and easily parsed).  But you do split at least raw,
</I>&gt;<i> (pseudo)nmea, and json as individually controllable.
</I>
Right.  Has to be that way, as dumping raw all the time could cause severe 
problems when binary-protocol devices are involved.  But I'm not understanding
why WATCH is a problem for you.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;From the client's point of view, I want lat/lon, and maybe altitude
</I>&gt;<i> and heading if I'm doing google earth.  I also don't need every tiny
</I>&gt;<i> update on my 10Hz stream.  I might also want the last stale reading
</I>&gt;<i> (which WATCH won't return and I don't think POLL will even if we just
</I>&gt;<i> entered a parking structure - we might need a &quot;keep on always&quot;, or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;poll every N minute&quot; option).
</I>
?POLL; will return whatever is cached from the last fix.  So yes, that
can be a &quot;stale&quot; reading.

&gt;<i> I can use something like POLL, but it would help if I can trim the
</I>&gt;<i> data it returns to just what I need.  Even now what happens if you
</I>&gt;<i> have more than one GPS device and the combined fix and sky data
</I>&gt;<i> exceeds 1024 bytes (listed as a hard limit)?
</I>
The response will be truncated.  The current limit is actually 1536 (I've
corrected the documentation) which is 19 consecutive full 80-character 
lines of text. I'll document the truncation.

Is there some reason you can't just scan for the first &quot;lat&quot;:NNN and
&quot;lon&quot;:NNN in the POLL response buffer?  If you don't need a full parse,
don't do one.

&gt;<i> Worse (noting what 10Hz NMEA does to my jailbroken slow iPod touch),
</I>&gt;<i> each of these events typically are acted upon, so the small amount of
</I>&gt;<i> power gpsd might consume causes a cascade of reloading or scrolling a
</I>&gt;<i> whole screen almost constantly to move it 2-3 pixels every fraction of
</I>&gt;<i> a second.  From the other side, if I wanted to use geolocation, I
</I>&gt;<i> would only want a notification every N seconds (even if redundant,
</I>&gt;<i> sort of a keep-alive, or just a PING), or if the location changed more
</I>&gt;<i> than a given amount.  If I 'm standing still, the map stays fixed and
</I>&gt;<i> no activity.  If I move slowly, it reloads or shifts every minute or
</I>&gt;<i> so to keep me on the map.  If I'm driving across the freeways out
</I>&gt;<i> west, every few seconds or every second is not unwarranted.
</I>
Right, this does sound like a job for POLL.

&gt;<i> Legacy GPSD was easy to pick out.  By having variable JSON it is only
</I>&gt;<i> easier to pick out if you have a library that can parse it and do
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions right if things are missing or coding around it.  And it is
</I>&gt;<i> likely to be all done in doubles anyway negating having NOFLOAT for
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd itself.
</I>
One of the things NOFLOAT is going to have to do is change JSON reporting
so each object reports &quot;scaled&quot;:false and integer values where there are
now floats.

&gt;<i> &gt; Look in the attribute tables. There's a column to tell you whether or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not an attribute is optional; that's your MUST. &#160;If you want or need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more detailed specification than that, explain and I'll try to fill it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It just says always, and then typically for only the class and one
</I>&gt;<i> other entry.  Some of the fields are only present if mode is 2, some
</I>&gt;<i> if 3.  Will alt always be there if mode is 3?  Can it be there (maybe
</I>&gt;<i> stale) if mode is 2?
</I>
Documenting this now.  As a general rule, TPV never reports stale data.

&gt;<i> If there is supposed to be some system to this, it should be
</I>&gt;<i> explained.  If it is all ad-hoc/willy-nilly, you should add regression
</I>&gt;<i> tests to randomize which fields are there or not.  (It doesn't even
</I>&gt;<i> say that you will get both lat and lon or neither).
</I>
It does now. :-)

The &quot;system&quot; is that if the device reports it or we can compute it (as,
for example, with climb if we have two successive fixes with altitude_
it gets reported; otherwise, not.

I'll work on documenting the existence conditions for each field.  You
should keep prodding me about this.

&gt;<i> It could have &quot;alt&quot;:null. 
</I>
Actually, no.  GPSD JSON never ships a null value.  It omits the field
instead.  I will document this.

The reason, BTW, is that JSON null is difficult to map into the type
ontology of C and other fixed-extent languages.  Thus, excluding this
value makes client-binding libraries simpler.

&gt;<i>                       You are documenting what the current code
</I>&gt;<i> actually does, not what a conforming implementation may/should/must
</I>&gt;<i> do.  And you are explaining it here, not on the manpage.  All the
</I>&gt;<i> manpage says for alt is Always:no.
</I>
All the explanation I'm giving you here is going into gpsd.xml as
your questions elicit it.

&gt;<i> The manpage should then explain the behavior of the code, not the
</I>&gt;<i> other way around.
</I>
No need to get snotty. The man page *does* explain the behavior of the code, 
in quite a bit more detail than is usual for service daemons.  It fails to
do so perfectly only because I'm too close to the code and nobody has asked
me the right questions before. You are asking them, and this is good, but
addressing me as though I need to be taught basic good practice is
unwarranted.
 
&gt;<i> And what is required by libgpsd? - if it depends on undocumented or
</I>&gt;<i> not fully documented gpsd behavior, then there are problems.
</I>
Undocumented behavior of what?  The gpsd dispatcher layer?  I'm highly
doubtful that's a real problem - I was really careful about the
layering there and have successfully written two other tools that use
libgpsd, gpsmon and gpsctl.

&gt;<i>                                                        For that
</I>&gt;<i> matter, if I understand, you need to know the unix device name of the
</I>&gt;<i> GPS even if there is only one in the system, or it moves (bluetooth on
</I>&gt;<i> an new rfcommN), and as far as I can tell there isn't anything in
</I>&gt;<i> libgpsd which can return a list of devices.
</I>
At the libgpsd level, you are presumed to have direct access to the
array of session structures, which libgpsd maniplulates one at a time but 
doesn't manaage.  You can walk through them yourself if you need to.

&gt;<i> And you can pick the disabled GPS instead of the working one.
</I>
I don't understand why you're worried about this level.  You'll
never see it, except via the gpsd dispatcher.

&gt;<i> Even if I merge my implementation into gpsd-ng to make it NOFLOAT -
</I>&gt;<i> which I really want to do - I'm in a position to ask the questions as
</I>&gt;<i> if I was going to implement it ex nihilo.  Also I have all the data in
</I>&gt;<i> mine that it should be simple just to follow the manpage as a recipe
</I>&gt;<i> and just implement the formats and behaviors such that clients
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't care which one is running.  But it isn't that way, at least
</I>&gt;<i> not yet.  That is why the questions on why &quot;tag&quot; exists - I don't have
</I>&gt;<i> anything similar and it sounds like something implementation specific
</I>&gt;<i> even if useful.  And that is why the other questions.  I know what
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd-ng does because the code is easily readable, but there isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> why it does what it does but not something else.
</I>
Keep asking questions, they're good for the quality of the documentation.
