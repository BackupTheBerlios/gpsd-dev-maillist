They are the same thing in this case.  If the differing members of the
structure need to be coherent, e.g.. the timestamp should correspond
to the time of the data, then they have to be written and read
synchronously to have integrity.

</I>
The socket shouldn't block.  And something else is wrong if select()
is lying about things that shouldn't block when accessed.
I should have been clearer - OS induced jitter is one thing, but relyin g

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe double buffer like I suggested with the ReaderNotWriter boolean

</I>
Assuming you are using your reader code.  No external userspace
program should be able to block the write thread at all.  Otherwise
you can have someone implement things wrongly where they get the lock,
grab the first data item, download a map, plot it, grab a second item,
annotate the map with it...

You have to protect if the reader hangs for whatever reason.

The OS is going to be used for semaphores, so using other things might
not be so much less efficient.  A small FIFO queue where the readers
could always look one behind the write pointer would work too.
