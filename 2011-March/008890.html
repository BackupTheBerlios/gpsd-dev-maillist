<PRE>volatile != mutex as someone pointed out.

The sync GCC builtins appear to be for itanium only.  Every processor
has a different one, but I think what you are looking for is a
systemwide semaphore.  Linux and BSD has sem_open for named
semaphores.

You would not need a pointer, and two buffers should work as I
suggested in an earlier message, however there can be only one reader
and one writer.  Note that a pipe would be almost the same thing.

I was using shared memory when I wanted readers to access data fast,
and it was all atomic 32 bit integers so the writes couldn't update
only part of an integer, and hiccups would be noncritical.

For the two (or N) buffer model with one reader and one writer, a flag
in each is interpreted as &quot;ok to read&quot; or &quot;ok to write&quot; depending on
state (usually zero/nonzero, a C boolean), initially set to &quot;ok to
write&quot;.  The writer will find the first buffer &quot;ok to write&quot;, update
the whole structure, and set the flag &quot;ok to read&quot;.

The reader would scan the buffers for &quot;ok to read&quot;, pull the data,
then set the flag back to &quot;ok to write&quot;.

The key here is that only the writer can say &quot;ok to read&quot; for a
buffer, and only the reader can say &quot;ok to write&quot;.
Most of the time only the first buffer will be used by the writer, but
if a collision happens if the write is important the data will end up
in the second (or later) buffer.  The writer can also pause and check
a few milliseconds later, or if it isn't important to get every
sample, just not write that cycle (as might happen if the read process
is halted or being restarted or busy).

Circular queues are also safe as the writer will increment the head
and the reader will increment the tail - this is ultimately what the
pointer you mention originally would end up being - but you need two,
one to indicate the last write, and one to indicate the last read.  It
still doesn't help with multiple readers.

There is no easy way to do multiple readers to a single buffer without
a semaphore - you can do the multi buffer trick above with semaphores
or just have it pause the write.  However you can do something like a
linked list daisy chain of readers so the first reader becomes a
writer and pipe (literally or through some other structure) the data
from the head to the tail or the read list or otherwise distribute it.
