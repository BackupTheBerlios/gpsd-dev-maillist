It solves the optimization but not the fundamental problems.

There's also <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock-free_and_wait-free_algorithms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock-free_and_wait-free_algorithms</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> But we ALSO have the multi-core with cache problem. &#160;Whereas the core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that gpsd is runnning on has conducted the semaphore writes into local
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cache properly, the cache makes no guarantee on the order in which the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cache is flushed to main memory! &#160;So the semaphore operations may get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reordered by the cache flush. &#160;This appears to be very architecture
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependent and probably less of a problem in x86 than others. &#160;Ouch.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only way around this is a memory barrier, which is an instruction to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the CPU to flush its cache before continuing.
</I>
Or there is typically a test and set lock that will set a value, but
return a code if it is already set (which means failed ot get
semapohore unit)

The cache is one problem, but even with volatile, the various reads
and writes won't necessarily be in sync.

Reader --- Writer

ReadOK  is true
                 -  Make ReadOK false
Read numberf of sats as 7
                - write number of sats is now 4.
Read all 7 sats
                - write into same area.

&gt;<i> Ah, I see. Your &quot;memory barrier&quot; is a way around the problem of the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware-level memory controller on multicore system not enforcing cache
</I>&gt;<i> coherency itself.
</I>
Usually it goes beyond to external hardware flushing things and locking out DMA

It doesn't force correctness or atomicity of the reads.

&gt;<i> I agree that this is a real problem in general. &#160;I'm not very worried
</I>&gt;<i> about it in the use case we have for a shared-memory interface,
</I>&gt;<i> though. &#160;I anticipate this interface being used in low-power,
</I>&gt;<i> single-core deployments like tz's Chumby. &#160;I'd be OK with adding dire
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Don't Go There On Multicore!&quot; warnings to the docs, if it came to that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, since we need to solve this problem for ntpshm, whatever
</I>&gt;<i> way of setting up memory barriers we develop for that case can be
</I>&gt;<i> re-used here.
</I>
counters can only work if you do a full copy of the structure, then
verify the count hasn't changed, and redo until you get a full buffer
without this happening.

The others are forms of queues or require semaphores and blocking.

Or you can bypass it if the effects of unsynced data are minor and
transitory, like having a readout one sample stale.  Or are just
displaying an animated compass needle
