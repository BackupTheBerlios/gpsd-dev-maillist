</I>&gt;<i> in principle. &#160;It's not a good use of effort to install a slightly
</I>&gt;<i> better lock on your door when the walls around it have crumbled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also don't assume they are in /dev or otherwise owned by root. &#160;I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might also be able to grab the datastream from a pty with just a cat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command since you don't open those exclusively (the EXCL isn't set,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it might be, just the &quot;is opened elsewhere already&quot; could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dropped for a pty).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Opening devices not owned by root is another one of those &quot;if you're
</I>&gt;<i> smart enough to to get yourself into this kind of trouble, you better
</I>&gt;<i> be smart enough to deal with the consequences&quot; cases. &#160;It's just not
</I>&gt;<i> worth complicating the code for these. &#160;When you try, the increment
</I>&gt;<i> of complexity does things to your defect rate that are worse than
</I>&gt;<i> ignoring the supposed problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> EXCL only works on a create. &#160;It would be handy if it were otherwise,
</I>&gt;<i> but alas no.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Note that if you were actually to come up with a sneak path I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; become much less hostile to channel numbers, since that vulnerability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; would create a *requirement* for a layer of indirection to mask the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; filenames.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A bit contrived, but off the top of my head, assume you have an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise secure system behind an ethernet switch but I'm somewhere on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the net where I can access the gpsd port and I do an ordinary WATCH or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> POLL. &#160;I see the udp or tcp URI, say the actual GPS source is an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> embedded device on the roof or outside with a wifi or ethernet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection. &#160;UDP is now simple as I can probably inject packets and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even take over the stream. &#160;TCP is a bit more subtle, but I now also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know another address which is active, so can play games with ARP, even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if switches or something like WPK2 was active.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Contrived indeed, but the best argument you've made yet because it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't involve the victim doing something actively perverse or
</I>&gt;<i> bonehead-stupid. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This really falls under &quot;don't use unsecured wireless for anything
</I>&gt;<i> life-critical&quot;. Duh... &#160;If you care about security that much, why
</I>&gt;<i> don't you have proper end-to-end encryption on your network?
</I>
No, both sources could be on the public internet.  One of gpsd's
function is to publish information.

You aren't building TLS as an option (The AUTHENTICATION is more
important than the encryption - I can't require valid certs for
sources, nor validate I'm talking to the real gpsd at the remote end).

So I'm a hacker trying to penetrate your system and you have gpsd
installed, and are using it to publish position information for data
gathering.  I now know what kind of system since the device paths are
a signature of the OS type (see below), I also know what kind of
device, and if you are using the GPS over a network, I know something
about that too, maybe including a source port you will let through
your firewall.

I'll merge intwo points from the discussion here from the inconsistency thread:

(device names, briefly here)

&gt;<i> True enough.  But one of the advantages of referring to device filenames
</I>&gt;<i> is that you have all the resolution rules of filenames, and the ability to do
</I>&gt;<i> things like stty and stat to get more information about them.
</I>
If I'm on a local Linux system, I can find out the device name in
/proc for linux or with lsof or something else but I already have to
be there.  You expose this information whether or not the port is
local or remote and without any authentication.

And if your &quot;open exclusive&quot; code is working, stty won't, at least not
while gpsd is connected and if you aren't root.

&gt;&gt;<i> (asking if the strings are supposed to be meaningful or not)
</I>
&gt;<i> No, all we really rely on is that they're distinct from each other.
</I>
Actually you aren't.  You aren't checking for a pathname that starts
from the root, so I can produce a collision.  I also didn't see (but
may have missed) code that would  prevent opening two identical <A HREF="tcp://">tcp://</A>
or <A HREF="udp://">udp://</A> URIs. - which you should do in any case (since the source
port would be distinct, two identical <A HREF="tcp://">tcp://</A> URLS might be to two
entries in a pool, or simply be to the same remote device)..

The OS isn't enforcing this, and you aren't checking for this, and for
network URLs you don't have enough in the string to enforce
uniqueness.

&quot;gpsd -D9 -N <A HREF="tcp://localhost:8888">tcp://localhost:8888</A> <A HREF="tcp://localhost:8888">tcp://localhost:8888</A>&quot;

shows that it is &quot;stashing&quot; both identical device names into slots 0 and 1.

This is actually a valid use case - I can connect N gps physical
devices to a remote system, and just like I can connect to a web
server multiple times, I can connect and serve gps devices from a
pool.

But the names aren't unique.  I haven't set it up far enough to
actually get DEVICE json sentences back, but if it worked they would
be identical.

&gt;&gt;<i> It would also let me tell if I was chrooted - I should see the device
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> node gpsd is connected with in my tree if I'm not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Point. &#160;Minor one, but a point. &#160;If I get a bug report that says &quot;gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> is leaking info about my chroot structure and this is a practical
</I>&gt;<i> problem because...&quot; I'll take it seriously.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Another things is the device name buffer is 64 bytes. &#160;I don't think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the strlcpy is pre-checked by strlen when you do:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;if (device != NULL)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (void)strlcpy(session-&gt;gpsdata.dev.path, device,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; sizeof(session-&gt;gpsdata.dev.path));
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is if the desired node is beyond 63 bytes, and the 63 byte
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> path is valid, it will attempt to open whatever the path does point to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - a directory most likely but it might do something unexpected. &#160;You
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could use the return from strlcpy:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if( strlen(device) != strlcpy... )
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; error_handle();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you ever in your entire life seen a serial device name that was
</I>&gt;<i> 63 chars long? &#160;No, better: have you ever even seen one that was *16*
</I>&gt;<i> chars long?
</I>
Daily.  Right now.  On my Mac OSX.  For any bluetooth device, it
creates /dev/tty.(bluetooth-friendly-name)-SPP  (or -Modem... SPPslave
etc.), and the friendly name of one of my devices is 20 characters
long by itself.  None of this is contrived.

Also, it isn't limited to serial devices.  The URIs for <A HREF="tcp://">tcp://</A> and
<A HREF="udp://">udp://</A> with ports have to fit, and if they are using DNS there is no
such restriction.

/dev/./././. - ./ttyUSB11 can be truncated to ttyUSB1 and the open
will SUCCEED on the truncated name.

You said the code had to be as safe as possible or practical, yet
there are a lot of unchecked and unprotected things throughout.  And
I've already noted that it is ok to fail, as long as the failure is
conspicuous, i.e. opening ttyUSB11 should either open ttyUSB11 or
fail, not successfully open ttyUSB1 instead, lock, stty it, and start
probing.

So which is it, if the user is stupid or doesn't use enough external
security, well gpsd wasn't designed to be safe, or gpsd is supposed to
be designed to be as safe as possible from both stupidity and malice?

If someone malicious tries hard and does break gpsd's assumptions,
they might be able to do more harm than you can expect.  I've found a
few things in just a cursory glance of the code and I'm not looking
for problems and won't try fuzzing (I think gpsctl is run as root, so
if it isn't unidirectional and I can buffer-overflow, root!  - I just
have to kill gpsd and set up a malicous version).  That is why I don't
like loose ends like these.  It isn't only friendly, noob, or strange
case users that you have to worry about.

I'm rooting for gpsd to be more secure :).

&gt;<i> I haven't, not even once in the 31 years I've been a Unix guy. &#160;There
</I>&gt;<i> are potential buffer-overrun problems worth worrying about. This is
</I>&gt;<i> not one of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I grant you there are rare cases like Ntrip URLs that can get longer
</I>&gt;<i> than that. &#160;But they won't have valid prefixes.
