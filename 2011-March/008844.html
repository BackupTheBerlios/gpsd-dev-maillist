<PRE>Diego Berge &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at navlost.eu</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>    Not necessarily. When using GPS for timing applications, accuracy in
</I>&gt;<i> the order of 100 nanoseconds (100*10-7) are entirely achievable.
</I>
PPS triggering cuing a clock crystal in a specialized device may be that 
accurate, but it would be *highly* misleading to claim that much accuracy 
for consumer or even survey-grade devices reporting over a serial link.

&gt;<i>    Where does the 3.4*10^-7 figure come from btw? It does not
</I>&gt;<i> particularly ring a bell with me.
</I>
I got that from a quote out of one of the ISGPS specs, I think.  A
little Googling suggests that the ISGPS spec was being somewhat
economical with the truth; it was the correct figure, but only under
Selective Availability :-).

&quot;HP Application Note 1289&quot; on precision chronometry is cited by the
Wikipedia article on GPS as saying that without SA the intrinsic
accuracy of the system is about 14ns. I've read that note to verify
the figure, and will change that sentence to cite &quot;14 nanoseconds&quot;.

&gt;<i>    Incidentally, the rest of the quotation from the man page needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> revised--from a quick look and being rather tired, I can spot the
</I>&gt;<i> following problems:
</I>
I'm not sure where I got the 0.01 sec resolution. It was probably from some
device vendor's documentation.  I can tell you this for sure: most 
devices only report in hundredths of a second.  This is notably true
of SiRFs, which are about 80% of the consumer-grade market.

Since I don't remember what my sources were and there are mptre restrictive
accuracy limits in the chain, I've revised to say this:

    The time reporting of the GPS system itself has an intrinsic
    accuracy limit of 14 nanoseconds, but this can only be approximated by
    specialized receivers using that send the high-accuracy PPS
    (Pulse-Per-Second) over RS232 to cue a clock crystal.  Most GPS
    receivers only report time to a precision of 0.01s or 0.001s,
    and with no accuracy guarantees below 1sec.
 
&gt;<i>    As tz said, accuracy is not the same as precision, and in turn that
</I>&gt;<i> is not the same as your reporting resolution, which has to be at least
</I>&gt;<i> as high as can be found on any supported receivers.  That would mean
</I>&gt;<i> milliseconds for 8Hz capable receivers, as noted above.
</I>
There's no coding problem with changing the reporting resolution to
milliseconds, but I'm not going to do it this close before release. 

I do have something of an issue with using a reporting format that claims 
more precision than most devices actually deliver.

&gt;<i> &gt; Doesn't this introduce a second of latency if the update rate is 1Hz?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I believe so.
</I>
No.  I've already explained this; gpsd detects the end of the NMEA reporting
cycle and thereafter reports on it, avoiding the additional second of latency.
