<PRE>Between the ntp-hackers discussion of synchronization and my own growing 
interest in writing a shared-memory exporter for gpsd, I've had good reason
to think recently about lightweight synchronization mechanism for shared
memory. 

The case I'm addressing is one reader, one or more writers.  
The problem is that partial writes and partial reads may be mixed in
any order, and the goal is for the reader to be have certainty when
it has read the result of a complete write.

I think I have invented a mechanism that avoids contention due to
blocking semaphores and is guaranteed correct under relatively weak
assumptions.  I present it for review and criticism.

Let's say we have a given struct payload_t we want to ship safely.  On
each update, we actually write a wrapper structure that looks like
this:

struct wrapper_t 
{
    int startguard;
    struct payload_t payload;
    int endguard;
};

The sentinels startguard and endguard are initially zero. Before each write,
they are incremented.

The reader's algorithm is simple: memcpy from the shared segment.  If both
sentinels are correct, the read is good.

I believe all that is required for guaranteed correctness is that the
writer updates the storage bytes in the shared-memory segment in an
order that is either monotonic-increasing or monotonic-decreasing, and
the reader likewise reads bytes in a monotonic order.

Part of the reason I think this is an interesting technique is that I
believe the following: on essentially all modern processors, memcpy(3)
is optimized to a single-instruction bitblt that reads and updates
memory in a monotonic order (certainly this is true of naive C
implementations of memcpy()). Thus, it should be sufficient for the
writer to memcpy() into the struct and the reader to memcpy() out of
it.  It doesn't matter whether or not memcpy() is interruptible.

I am ignoring cache-coherency issues, which are orthogonal to those this
technique addresses.  Yes, read and write may need surrounding memory 
barriers.

That's it.  Please discuss and criticize.

make my enemies ridiculous.&quot; And God granted it.
