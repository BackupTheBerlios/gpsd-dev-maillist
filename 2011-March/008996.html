<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not seeing a problem here. &#160;The user can't modify or delete those files,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so where's the security/assurance threat?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you can delete &quot;those files&quot;, depending on where they are or
</I>&gt;<i> how secure they are since they are just a filesystem node and you are
</I>&gt;<i> only doing an exclusive flag with an ioctl after the open, not locking
</I>&gt;<i> the inode.
</I>
You are in a general way right.  But if my opponent has root server
access so I can't trust filesystem security, I'll have much larger
problems than this including some vulnerabilities I can't block even
in principle.  It's not a good use of effort to install a slightly 
better lock on your door when the walls around it have crumbled.

&gt;<i> Also don't assume they are in /dev or otherwise owned by root.  I
</I>&gt;<i> might also be able to grab the datastream from a pty with just a cat
</I>&gt;<i> command since you don't open those exclusively (the EXCL isn't set,
</I>&gt;<i> but it might be, just the &quot;is opened elsewhere already&quot; could be
</I>&gt;<i> dropped for a pty).
</I>
Opening devices not owned by root is another one of those &quot;if you're
smart enough to to get yourself into this kind of trouble, you better
be smart enough to deal with the consequences&quot; cases.  It's just not
worth complicating the code for these.  When you try, the increment
of complexity does things to your defect rate that are worse than
ignoring the supposed problem.

EXCL only works on a create.  It would be handy if it were otherwise, 
but alas no.

&gt;<i> &gt; Note that if you were actually to come up with a sneak path I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; become much less hostile to channel numbers, since that vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would create a *requirement* for a layer of indirection to mask the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; filenames.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A bit contrived, but off the top of my head, assume you have an
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise secure system behind an ethernet switch but I'm somewhere on
</I>&gt;<i> the net where I can access the gpsd port and I do an ordinary WATCH or
</I>&gt;<i> POLL.  I see the udp or tcp URI, say the actual GPS source is an
</I>&gt;<i> embedded device on the roof or outside with a wifi or ethernet
</I>&gt;<i> connection.  UDP is now simple as I can probably inject packets and
</I>&gt;<i> even take over the stream.  TCP is a bit more subtle, but I now also
</I>&gt;<i> know another address which is active, so can play games with ARP, even
</I>&gt;<i> if switches or something like WPK2 was active.
</I>
Contrived indeed, but the best argument you've made yet because it
doesn't involve the victim doing something actively perverse or
bonehead-stupid. :-)

This really falls under &quot;don't use unsecured wireless for anything
life-critical&quot;. Duh...  If you care about security that much, why
don't you have proper end-to-end encryption on your network?

&gt;<i> It would also let me tell if I was chrooted - I should see the device
</I>&gt;<i> node gpsd is connected with in my tree if I'm not.
</I>
Point.  Minor one, but a point.  If I get a bug report that says &quot;gpsd
is leaking info about my chroot structure and this is a practical
problem because...&quot; I'll take it seriously.

&gt;<i> Another things is the device name buffer is 64 bytes.  I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> the strlcpy is pre-checked by strlen when you do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    if (device != NULL)
</I>&gt;<i>         (void)strlcpy(session-&gt;gpsdata.dev.path, device,
</I>&gt;<i>                       sizeof(session-&gt;gpsdata.dev.path));
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is if the desired node is beyond 63 bytes, and the 63 byte
</I>&gt;<i> path is valid, it will attempt to open whatever the path does point to
</I>&gt;<i> - a directory most likely but it might do something unexpected.  You
</I>&gt;<i> could use the return from strlcpy:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if( strlen(device) != strlcpy... )
</I>&gt;<i>   error_handle();
</I>
Have you ever in your entire life seen a serial device name that was
63 chars long?  No, better: have you ever even seen one that was *16*
chars long?

I haven't, not even once in the 31 years I've been a Unix guy.  There
are potential buffer-overrun problems worth worrying about. This is
not one of them.

I grant you there are rare cases like Ntrip URLs that can get longer
than that.  But they won't have valid prefixes.
