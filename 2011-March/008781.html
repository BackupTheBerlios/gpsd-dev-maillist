gpsd does build cross with it's configure.in - I have set that up and
seen it work, from linux i386 to linux arm.  If it's broken since,
that's a bug to be fixed.

Calling configure 20000 lines isn't helpeful or fair; it's the size of
configure.in that is relevant.  We don't count the size of /bin/sh to
run it, or the size of the python interpreter, etc.

Trimming configure.in for more SUS assumptions seems reasonable (post
release of course).

  Perhaps my biggest package annoyance with bluez is that it typically
  requires bluez-gnome in the dependencies for PIN support, so even if
  there is nothing else requiring a GUI, the entire Gnome desktop and
  down is brought in.  That is the effect.

That sounds pretty broken, but you should file a bug with the bluez
people or your linux distribution.


One trick I've seen in NetBSD is to have a config.h (or output of
configure) stored for a particular OS.  There are many things that use
autoconf where that's done and then the build process uses BSD make
instead, but without requiring that the upstream change.


Also, I realize that I'm boggled by your apparent need to have
autoconf/etc installed on the reduced-capability system.  When building
From a release, one needs a posix /bin/sh of course, but you don't need
to run autoconf, automake or libtool from their packages.    So are you
trying to build from a git checkout, without having prepared a release
on a capable system?
