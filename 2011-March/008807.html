<PRE>
As of release-2.95-1044-g6a873eb, all tests pass on NetBSD/i386
5.1-stable and NetBSD/sparc64 5.1-stable.
ublox antaris-4 devkit (USB) successfully livetested OK on i386.

cgps works, but xgps doesn't, and I haven't had time to dig into that.
(xgps gets json, but it doesn't display anything.)


On NetBSD/sparc 4-stable, I got a lot of regression failures.  I've had
this computer for a very long time, but this is the first time I've
tried to run gpsd on it.  Amusing, it has a truetime XL-DC GPS timing
receiver on a serial port to ntpd, and has been like that for over 10
years, with a minor &quot;upgrade&quot; from SparcStation IPX to Classic at some
point).

The build times are sort of interesting:

  autogen took around 2h
  configure took around 10m
  build took around 1h55m
  make check-programs took around 15m
  check took around 1h4m

So given that there's no good reason to run autogen in reduced
environments (make dist on a capable machine has no real downsides), the
build time was dominated by C compilation.

The make check log is at

Some things look timing related, but not many.

This machine is

  32-bit, meaning ILP32
  big endian
  IEEE-754 floating point
  generally thought to work well for scientific computing
