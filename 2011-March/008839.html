<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> My concern here is I would rather specify an &quot;unknown&quot; number of
</I>&gt;<i> decimal digits whose accuracy is questionable rather than locking
</I>&gt;<i> things down to two decimal digits.
</I>
Noted. Remind me after we ship.
 
&gt;<i> To clarify, it will queue data and emit a fix when the timestamp changes?
</I>&gt;<i> e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> RMC1, GLL1, GGA1 RMC2- triggers fix(RMC1-GLL1-GGA1) and starts fix(RMC2...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't this introduce a second of latency if the update rate is 1Hz?
</I>
No. What it does is watch for a timestamp change on the first cycle,
record the tag of the sentence *before* that as the cycle ender, and
subsequently ship on the cycle ender.  So no latency is introduced.

In your example, RMC1, GLL1, GGA1, RMC2, it would see the timestamp change 
on RMC, deduce that GGA is the cycle ender, then subsequently report on GGA.

&gt;<i> But my original question was the purpose for the tag in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place.  Why is it important for anything downstream to know it was
</I>&gt;<i> GGA, or RMC that triggered things?
</I>
Generally it won't be important in any way.  The tag is only there for
diagnostic purposes. It's not very informative on an NMEA device, but a bit
more so on a SiRF or other binary-packet device.

&gt;<i> So it uses the skyview raw data to compute [xyz]DoP?
</I>
Correct.  Of course this will need to be disabled when NOFLOAT.

&gt;<i>                                                          This is a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> computation if someone doesn't need the extra data, and the skyview is
</I>&gt;<i> returned.
</I>
It is a lot of computation by your standards, yes.  You need to bear
in mind that we have not tried to optimize for a really low-power
enivironment before; with cycle times being on the order of 1 second,
the DOP computation didn't have measurable impact.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is there a reason computed values are returned alongside the direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; values?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not certain what &quot;direct&quot; values you mean.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The GPS itself returns HDOP, VDOP, and PDOP.  To that you add
</I>&gt;<i> [XYZ]DOP. which are computed.
</I>
Right. This is basically so we can use [XYZ]DOP for 3D error modeling,
for which the traditional sum-of-squares DOPs aren't actually very
useful (but we report them because (a) I have a design rule about not
throwing away information, and (b) app designers might squawk if we
didn't). NOFLOAT will have to disable all this.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; On the gpsd.8 manpage and xml, &quot;Responce&quot; is used - that might be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; non US variant of response, otherwise it is a typo.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You must be looking at an old version; I can't find this in git head.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My error - I didn't pull the most recent version - it has been fixed
</I>&gt;<i> in the last few days.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you also need to update the website copies of the manpages as
</I>&gt;<i> I first noticed it there.
</I>
That will be done when we ship in a few days. Possibly sooner.
 
&gt;<i> But that is the root of my question.  There is no recommended practice
</I>&gt;<i> or guaranteed responses or even much clarity to how to send the
</I>&gt;<i> commands.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I send it a ?WATCH={'json':true}; and get some not really specified
</I>&gt;<i> response.  You get some kind of Device - one or more?, maybe a watch
</I>&gt;<i> status, I remember a third line...  I've sent different variants
</I>&gt;<i> (double quotes, ordering) of ?WATCH={'enabled':true,'json':true}; and
</I>&gt;<i> json was not set to true sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you send some kind of not very well specified blob, and get back
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of not very well specified blob - if it happens to contain
</I>&gt;<i> fields, the contents are detailed.
</I>
I think I see part of the problem.  You appear to be expecting the
control protocol to be specified as though it were a conversational or
lockstep protocol.  It isn't.  There is not anywhere in it anything
like synchronous command/response transaction.  There can't be,
because the devices can insert arbitrary delays before they respond to
command.

There were a couple of major design errors in the old protocol.  One
of them is that it pretended to be synchronous. It took me longer
than it should have to realize how many problems this was causing.

The right way to think about it is that the daemon is going to spew
reports at you at random intervals.  What *kind* of reports is
controlled mainly by the WATCH state, with a small random delay after
you set it.  Until a WATCH policy is set, all you'll see is device connect
and device disconnect notifications (after the initial VERSION and
DEVICES reports).

It's up to client code to aggregate the state from these events.  The C
library binding does this for you.

&gt;<i> What I was expecting is something like (don't take these to be accurate)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ?WATCH= MUST specify parameters in a specific order
</I>&gt;<i> ?WATCH= SHOULD specify enable last in the list
</I>&gt;<i> ?WATCH= MAY specify parameters in any order
</I>
The third alternative is correct. I just added this to the manual
page: &quot;The order of JSON attributes within a response object is never
significant, and you may specify attributes in commands in any order.&quot;

&gt;<i> (I also can't seem to find a way to only watch for position TPV and
</I>&gt;<i> not get the SKY but I might just be dense - I don't think browser
</I>&gt;<i> location will need SKY).
</I>
There is at present no way to specify this.  In general, the policy
options in WATCH specify what formats the daemon should ship reports
in, but do not set filters on which reports should be shipped. When
you set WATCH, all devices will ship you every report they can deliver;
it's up to the client to do content filtering.

The reason it's designed this way is that even at full flood from several 
devices the data volume is not very high; for most of each second the
socket will be idle.  Content filtering would add complexity that I'm
not yet convinced is necessary.

If you have a measured need to throttle back the amount of sending, 
then I might consider adding something like &quot;filter&quot;:{&quot;TPV&quot;} to WATCH.
But it would have to be a *measured* need, with profiling, not one
just guessed at.  I am concerned to avoid code bloat.

&gt;<i> The response MUST return the following:...  The response SHOULD ...
</I>&gt;<i> The response MAY...  Both for content and ordering.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the TPV - are the device and tag fields MUST, SHOULD, or MAY?
</I>&gt;<i> They might be for libgps, but not if you are decoding the json
</I>&gt;<i> directly.
</I>
Look in the attribute tables. There's a column to tell you whether or
not an attribute is optional; that's your MUST.  If you want or need
more detailed specification than that, explain and I'll try to fill it
in.
 
&gt;<i> This might not belong on the gpsd.8 manpage, but it is a detailed
</I>&gt;<i> protocol and it isn't really documented as a protocol.  Think RFC
</I>&gt;<i> (actually that would be a good idea - do an RFC to document this).
</I>&gt;<i> There should be a certain minimum MUST.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The actual protocol is whatever standard you want to set and has to
</I>&gt;<i> precisely describe the behavior of whatever implementation.  Right now
</I>&gt;<i> it is &quot;whatever the code does&quot; and the code can change.  If some are
</I>&gt;<i> depending on specific fields and they go away, it will break.
</I>
The intent is that the protocol is documented with RFC completeness
on gpsd(8).  If I'm not achieving that, do criticize the docs so
I can fix them.
 
&gt;<i> One of the problems with the original GPSD is it was quirky - the
</I>&gt;<i> commands and responses were all ad-hoc but at least were uniform and
</I>&gt;<i> constant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JSON creates the problem because it is &quot;extensible&quot;, but also
</I>&gt;<i> contractable, e.g. no altitude for 2d.  But is this behavior set in
</I>&gt;<i> stone, or ad-hoc?
</I>
It depends on what the underlying device sends.  If you don't have a 3D
fix, TPV won't report altitude.  It really can't be any other way.
