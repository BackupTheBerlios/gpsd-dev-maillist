   Not necessarily. When using GPS for timing applications, accuracy in
the order of 100 nanoseconds (100*10-7) are entirely achievable.

   Where does the 3.4*10^-7 figure come from btw? It does not
particularly ring a bell with me.

   Incidentally, the rest of the quotation from the man page needs to be
revised--from a quick look and being rather tired, I can spot the
following problems:

 * &quot;the satellites only emit navigation messages at 0.01-second
intervals&quot;: the navigation message is transmitted continuously at a
chipping rate of 1024 chips per second and a symbol (bit) rate of 50
sps. Its length is 1500 symbols (? from memory). Therefore, two complete
navigation frames are received every minute.

 * &quot;the timestamps in them only carry 0.01-second precision&quot;: I'm not
sure what timestamps it refers to. The closest I can think of is the
truncated TOW message in the HOW (hand-over word), which has a
resolution of one second and is transmitted once every six seconds. The
time of week in it, however, refers to a very specific point in the data
frame, the leading edge of the start of the next frame, and therefore is
notionally accurate to at least one chip, or 1/1024th of a second (the
actual accuracy will depend on a large number of factors, but basically
depends on how good you are at detecting phase changes in the R/F signal)

* &quot;Thus, the timestamps that gpsd reports in time/position/velocity
messages are normally accurate only to 1/100th of a second&quot;: I don't
think that follows from any of the preceding clauses in that sentence,
and is difficult to justify as a general statement.

&gt;<i> My concern here is I would rather specify an &quot;unknown&quot; number of
</I>&gt;<i> decimal digits whose accuracy is questionable rather than locking
</I>&gt;<i> things down to two decimal digits.
</I>
   As tz said, accuracy is not the same as precision, and in turn that
is not the same as your reporting resolution, which has to be at least
as high as can be found on any supported receivers.  That would mean
milliseconds for 8Hz capable receivers, as noted above.

&gt;<i> Doesn't this introduce a second of latency if the update rate is 1Hz?
</I>
   I believe so.

&gt;<i> So it uses the skyview raw data to compute [xyz]DoP?  This is a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> computation if someone doesn't need the extra data, and the skyview is
</I>&gt;<i> returned.
</I>
   Most users do need that data, although they may not always realise
this :) and it's not really a lot of computation at all.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a reason computed values are returned alongside the direct
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> values?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not certain what &quot;direct&quot; values you mean.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The GPS itself returns HDOP, VDOP, and PDOP.  To that you add
</I>&gt;<i> [XYZ]DOP. which are computed.
</I>
   The values returned by the receiver are also computed in exactly the
same well-documented way, so it really makes no difference who computes
what and it's handy for the user to have all of those available. Neither
the (receiver or gpsd computed) dilution of precision figures nor the
ephemeris are measurements so there are no error propagation
considerations if that's what worries you.
