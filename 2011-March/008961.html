</I>&gt;<i> Correct. And yes, this is a reaction to you talking about a shared-memory

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, is the data going to be NOFLOAT? &#160;The internal structures are

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to be one or the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That will depend on whether you build client and daemon with NOFLOAT or not.
</I>&gt;<i> The transport part of the interface (shm and semaphore) won't care what's
</I>&gt;<i> in the struct, only the writers and readers will.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Semaphores are the most obvious mechanism but it starts to defeat the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simplicity of using a SHM. &#160;You need both the readers and writers to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use the semaphore, and you have to do it so readers won't block the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> writer nor each other, at least not for very long, and that gets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tricky. &#160;Linux's RCU mechanism doesn't have a user analog I've found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm open to a better way to do it, but I haven't thought of a simpler
</I>&gt;<i> method than shared-memory segment plus semaphore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The way I did it for the Nokia tablets (so my instrument cluster could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pick out speed, direction, etc whenever without blicking) is to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the 32 bit integers for everything so reads were atomic, and use a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory mapped file (mmap.h). &#160;I did it with an actual file in /tmp,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it should be just as doable with a file descriptor from a named
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shm from shm_open.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This guarantees that a single read of any field will get a correct
</I>&gt;<i> value for some timestamp, but not that your entire multiple-field copy
</I>&gt;<i> of a fix representation is associated with the same timestamp. &#160;That
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem good enough to me, not for potentially life-critical nav
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>
This is using GPS and isn't being written in Haskell. life-critical is
a completely different plane.

You are correct, but the probability of any one race is low, and it is
updating constantly, so there might be a glitch (fresh lat, stale
lon), but particularly at the higher rates the distance is smaller,
under 10 feet in a car on a freeway diagonally which is likely less
than shifting the satellites used.

If synchronization is critical, you need a pipe or one of the other mechanisms.


&gt;&gt;<i> There can still be problems since it is volatile, but the routines
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would need to check if anything changes, e.g. number of satellites.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Conversely, the readers could also do the lseek and read() and get the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data atomically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still sounds like a semaphore would be a safer way of interlocking. The
</I>&gt;<i> upper limit on read-write atomicity is not portable AFAIK.
</I>
It isn't portable, but there is a minimum page/sector size in most
implementations.  If there are multiple devices, each could have a
separate section of the shm.

&gt;<i> Maybe we could avoid reader contention with a simple backoff algorithm?
</I>
Maybe, but that sounds dodgy too.  You now have nondeterministic time
to access, and it can fail.

It is worse on the write side.  You need another thread, and maybe an
internal semaphore:

The writer basically does:
    Internal data image -&gt; shm data image.
But the internal data image has to be synchronized too and you only
want to update when the whole set has changed and is updated.
I think we don't want anything main in gpsd itself to block on the
semaphore writing to the shm area so we need yet another thread.
Create an internal pipe, and if it ever blocks don't refresh it?  Or
force the refresh?  Internal semaphore - don't update if it would
block?
Maybe double buffer like I suggested with the ReaderNotWriter boolean
field in the ntp discussion.
