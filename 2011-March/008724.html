But all of those test programs do very little besides display gpsd
output (which is fine for a test program).  They aren't dealing with
fetching maps, or sending baked data someplace (on a socket that might
block) or doing any other kind of processing or communicating.

  gpxlogger, lcdgps: Don't take input.

This is a toy example - just writes to file, and has no other purpose.
That's fine to exist, but not a good basis for evaluating the general case.

  cgps: Takes input.  Handled by doing a nonblocking wgetch() after each
  gps_read().  

So if the gps stops sending, you get a lag as it waits to respond to
keyboard input?  That seems like bad UI behavior - I think this program
done right needs to react quickly to user input.  When I type 'q' there
is a noticeable pause before it exits.

  xgps: Takes input.  The effect of select is implicit through the GTK
  event-handling loop.

so you are adding gpsd's file descriptor to GTK's select loop, which is
the normal paradigm (with a library owning the loop).


It's not like a select loop is a lot of code, even with error checking.
