I'm writing to point out that NTP and GPSD are facing near-identical 
problems here.  We too have a one-writer/many-readers shred-memory
interface we're trying to design with good consistency guarantees.

As noted in that other thread I started: If your premise is that you
can't require on memory barriers, you may *have* to go with a
semaphore, because in their absence instruction reordering and strange
memory-controller strategies can cause serious problems for spinlocks.

I myself am seriously considering abandoning the spinlock variation I
invented in favor of a semaphore.  I invented my mechanism because I
wanted to avoid contention on a semaphore, but in thinking about it
further I think I may have been more worried about that than I should
have been.

Only one process (the single writer) would ever change the semaphore
state; the readers would just block or spin until it goes to zero.  In
GPSD writes are infrequent, now normally 1 per second and highly
unlikely to exceed 100 per second even with survey-grade GPSes we
don't support yet.  Writes are also small, less than 8K.

Given this timing pattern, I think readers blocking on the semaphore seem
unlikely to take a performance hit that is much above the level of
profiling noise, if that. 

If NTP thinks it's looking at a similar timing pattern, you might want
to seriously look at using an explicit semaphore.

(I'm having big fun with all this.  Eric gets to think like an OS implementor
again, yay!  I've missed that, I have.)
