Thanks for your clear summary of the dilemma.

&gt;<i> This is pushing me back towards sticking with the working seqlock.
</I>&gt;<i> But *that* means I have to either deal with the pile of nonportable
</I>&gt;<i> hair that is memory barriers or expensively checksum the data.
</I>
If you do checksum, ISTR CRC32 isn't terribly strong for 8k.  MD5 is
widely-available and reasonably fast, and for this purpose, I beieve
its cryptographic weakness is any reason to avoid it.

&gt;<i> Yes, I've been listening to Terje too. &#160;The problem is that his proposal
</I>&gt;<i> is complicated enough to make my head hurt - and I plain don't trust
</I>&gt;<i> complicated algorithms in cases like this, they tend to have holes
</I>&gt;<i> where nobody is looking and be difficult to *maintain* correctness of
</I>&gt;<i> even if they started out correct.
</I>
The cost of 4 payload copies is trivial for refclock_shm.c, and CRC32
is more than sufficient to detect corruption and could be layered in
for belt-and-suspenders detection of problems with the lock-free ring
buffer approach.  The tradeoffs for gpsd are different.

Personally, my head isn't hurting thinking about the approach Terje
describes for refclock_shm.  I have used similar approaches for
producer/consumer lockless queueing repeatedly in the past.  That was
usually solving a slightly different problem, with a single or several
consumers that dequeue items, but it's easier with a more
broadcast-like arrangement of single writer, multiple readers who
never change shared memory, only examine.

Cheers,
Dave Hart
