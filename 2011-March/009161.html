I still haven't made the program runtime configurable, i.e. command line 
parameters for things like test time duration and number of threads, but 
the current source code is located here:

<A HREF="http://norloff.org/ntp/shm-test/">http://norloff.org/ntp/shm-test/</A>

This version actually uses 32 extra bytes per 32-byte timestamp record, 
making the total 64 bytes.

This means that each timestamp uses a separate cache line, meaning that 
with proper alignment (which is currently still missing) the writer can 
generate a new timestamp record without forcing all the readers to give 
up their read access to the previous record. It did increase the maximum 
read/write frequency by quite a bit.

I would love to see a *ix port, if nobody volunteers I'll use a VMware 
64-bit Ubuntu to see if I can figure out the relevant Linux calls.

&quot;almost all programming can be viewed as an exercise in caching&quot;
