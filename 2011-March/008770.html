Are he rtcm streams mixed together for those devices or do they get a
single stream for each rtcm source (e.g. different sockets)? It would be
very plausible to interpolate over multiple stations if those stations
are distinguishable. However, the rtcm data here is just &quot;thrown&quot; into
the gps device on a single channel. Maybe I am totally wrong here, but
it makes sense to me.

</I>&gt;<i>    That on the other hand is correct. You normally want to ensure that

</I>&gt;<i> stations with different ID), although that can sometimes be handled

</I>
And you cannot ensure this, if you have no control over which sources
are selected as is the case inside gpsd. Well, at least not without a
considerable amount of work. You'd have to alter the incoming rtcm data
in case of a conflict in station IDs.
