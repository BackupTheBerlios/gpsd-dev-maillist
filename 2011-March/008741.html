Which selections of the current enable/disable switches would you like
to see as light/normal ?

Solaris 8. No idea where they are now.

You might want to have a look at the OpenWRT buildchain - they build
basically everything on x86. Cross-building gpsd worked fine for me when
I tried some months ago and they still have gpsd packages, so it seems
it still works fine.

- there is only one patch in there repository we should apply.

</I>&gt;<i> That part probably has all the build complexity like GTK+.  But gpsd

</I>
Actually I have to admit I can't see your problem here. Setting up a
toolchain for cross-building is not *that* hard.
