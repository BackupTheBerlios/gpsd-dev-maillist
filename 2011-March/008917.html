<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Why is &quot;mode&quot; in TPV if it comes from GPGSA?  Shouldn't it or whatever
</I>&gt;<i> is in GPGSA be in SKY?  But you can derive mode from just the TPV
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>
Mode is in TPV because GPGSAs are normally issued by the per-fix report 
on one-second intervals.  That is, as opposed to GPGSVs which are normally
emnitted at 5-second intervals.

Nevertheless, I agree that mode is a bit of an uncomfortable edge case
for GPSD's assumptions.  It's reported on the timescale of fixes but only
changes on the timescale of the skyview.

&gt;<i> Note you need either GPRMC or BOTH GPGLL AND GPZDA to get the date and
</I>&gt;<i> then there is the midnight rollover problem (5Hz garmins if nothing
</I>&gt;<i> else).  To get altitude, you need GPGGA.
</I>
Correct.
 
&gt;<i> The lat/lon sentences have the A/V flag which would correspond to mode
</I>&gt;<i> 1 or &gt;1, and the number of satellites in GPGGA should give 2 or 3 for
</I>&gt;<i> 2d or 3d fix (ignore the altitude if 2d), but I propose changing 3 to
</I>&gt;<i> 4 if GPGGA also indicates DGPS is active.
</I>
That's not a bad idea.  Noted.  Remind me after release.

&gt;<i>                                          I don't see anywhere else
</I>&gt;<i> this higher accuracy is indicated.  It isn't DoP, it means whatever
</I>&gt;<i> numbers are being reported are being corrected.  It could be its own
</I>&gt;<i> tag.
</I>
The philosophy of the protocol as it is now is that what users really care
about is the xyz error bounds; DGPS correction is reflected by changing the 
UERE we multiply the DOPs by.  But defining a mode 4 would be a painless
way to export that information, so I'm not opposed to it.

&gt;<i> The set is lat/lon/validity, date, altitude/sats-2d3d/dgps, each with
</I>&gt;<i> time  TPV should go out at each complete set.  The particular
</I>&gt;<i> sentences aren't as important - if there is line noise, GPGLL/ZDA
</I>&gt;<i> could act as a backup for GPRMC.  You need to see GPRMC or GPZDA at
</I>&gt;<i> least once - but if it isn't a requirement, you need to have some code
</I>&gt;<i> to increment the date at the midnight cross (which could be part of
</I>&gt;<i> the midnight fix anyway).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There may be other combinations that give all the data, but if any
</I>&gt;<i> don't include time, then TPV would have to depend on bounding and
</I>&gt;<i> examining the entire frame and with arbitrary ordering, unless you are
</I>&gt;<i> looking for the interframe pause or something similar, it might be
</I>&gt;<i> very hard to tell which frame something without a time belongs to.
</I>&gt;<i> There is still the problem if they don't occur in every set of
</I>&gt;<i> sentences.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If GPGGA and GPRMC/(GPGLL+GPZDA) are not the same rate, you can still
</I>&gt;<i> only emit TPV when you get a complete set with the same time values.
</I>
Sounds like you're describing the way the NMEA driver already works,
pretty closely.
