&gt;<i> &gt; This guarantees that a single read of any field will get a correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; value for some timestamp, but not that your entire multiple-field copy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of a fix representation is associated with the same timestamp. &#160;That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not seem good enough to me, not for potentially life-critical nav
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is using GPS and isn't being written in Haskell. life-critical is
</I>&gt;<i> a completely different plane.
</I>
We do aim for that level of quality here.  Lethal risk must not be increased
by code we write.
 
&gt;<i> If synchronization is critical, you need a pipe or one of the other
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms.
</I>
Synchronization is not really the issue here; data integrity is the issue.

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe we could avoid reader contention with a simple backoff algorithm?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe, but that sounds dodgy too.  You now have nondeterministic time
</I>&gt;<i> to access, and it can fail.
</I>
We already have nondeterministic time to access, imposed by the socket layer.
Again, think in terms of guaranteeing data integrity.  The average and the
variance of added latency due to gpsd are both quite small (below the noise
threshold of the measurement tools); as long as that remains the case for
a shared-memory interface, it's a success.

&gt;<i> It is worse on the write side.  You need another thread, and maybe an
</I>&gt;<i> internal semaphore:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The writer basically does:
</I>&gt;<i>     Internal data image -&gt; shm data image.
</I>&gt;<i> But the internal data image has to be synchronized too and you only
</I>&gt;<i> want to update when the whole set has changed and is updated.
</I>&gt;<i> I think we don't want anything main in gpsd itself to block on the
</I>&gt;<i> semaphore writing to the shm area so we need yet another thread.
</I>&gt;<i> Create an internal pipe, and if it ever blocks don't refresh it?  Or
</I>&gt;<i> force the refresh?  Internal semaphore - don't update if it would
</I>&gt;<i> block?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe double buffer like I suggested with the ReaderNotWriter boolean
</I>&gt;<i> field in the ntp discussion.
</I>
These measures may turn out to be necessary.  But before I use them, I
will implement a simple write in the main thread and *measure* to see
if write overhead and reader contention produce measurable latency.
