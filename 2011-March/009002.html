That sort of reasoning about buffer overflow/truncation seems
inconsistent to me with your stated goal of ensuring a gpsd bug
doesn't kill someone.  Moreover, it's more thought than it's worth --
just do the right thing every time.  It's an easy habit to get into,
and it allows static analysis tools, for example, to flag questionable
code without triggering &quot;false&quot; positives where you have convinced
yourself a long input is impossible or harmless.  For this particular
snippet, my inclination would be something along the lines of:

if (device != NULL) {
        size_t octets;

        octets = strlen(device);
        if (octets &lt; sizeof(session-&gt;gpsdata.dev.path))
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;         memcpy(session-&gt;gpsdata.dev.path, device, octets);
        else
                gpsd_report(&quot;device name too long (ignored): %s\n&quot;, device);
}

You will find very few strcpy() or strcat() or sprintf() remaining in
the NTP reference implementation tarballs, though there were quite a
few two years ago, because I've been hunting down and addressing
potential buffer overruns.  I've also cleared up most of the items
flagged by Coverity Scan and a few other static analysis tools which
have been used with ntpd and results shared with us.

I see gpsd is signed up for Coverity Scan [1] and had four uninspected
&quot;defects&quot;.  Once you resolve those (whether by changing code or noting
a false positive using the scan website), Coverity should crank up the
analysis to flag even more potential issues.  This is described on the
scan website in the context of climbing their ladder to &quot;rung 2&quot;, but
even within rung 2, once we addressed nearly all the outstanding
defects through changes or feedback of a false positive, more tests
were enabled resulting in more potential defects to inspect.

Coverity did not produce any scans of ntpd for nearly a year ending
this January, and I've never been told why, and had to discover myself
by logging into their site that they had finally picked up again,
where a simple email would have let me react to the issues more than a
month sooner.  Still, I appreciate every scrap of donated static
analysis from them and others and I recognize they have paying
customers which take priority over their open source activities.

The good news is after a year of more-active-than-average churn, and
with more tests enabled, only 16 defects were identified.  I have that
down to 7 now, 5 of which are false positives in upstream libopts (a
command-line options processing library from GNU Autogen's autoopts).
One is a false positive in upstream libisc (from BIND 9, used by ntpd
for network interface enumeration).  Only one is in NTP code proper,
in ntpd/ntp_proto.c's receive(), a monstrously large function which
defies human analysis of all its paths.  It may be a real, but very
difficult to exercise, bug, or it may be a false positive, I'm not
sure, as it's the only example we've seen of a &quot;FORWARD_NULL&quot; analysis
test failure, and it's less than clear what the test is trying to
catch.

In over 10 years of NTP4 releases, there have been 4 security hotfixes
issued [2].  Two were simple buffer overflows that never needed to
happen.  The problems with the C runtime encouraging
overflow-vulnerable coding were widely understood at that point.
Safer alternatives for the worst offenders were specified in the ANSI
C standardization process 10 years before the first NTP4 release.

If gpsd developers currently having access to Coverity Scan results do
not have time to investigate, please ask <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">dmaxwell at coverity.com</A> to
grant userid davehart access to gpsd scan results.

At 17:07 UTC while I was composing this email, a new scan of ntpd
popped up on the Coverity site.  They apparently noticed there was
little meat left on the bone and enabled some more tests.  This run
has 158 &quot;new&quot; defects identified.  It will take some time to work
through them, but I'm optimistic I'll be glad I did based on prior
experience.  It's much easier to address each of these than it is to
handle the average user bug report.

Cheers,
Dave Hart
