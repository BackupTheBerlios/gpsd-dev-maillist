<PRE>There would be a problem with multiple writers if there wasn't/isn't a
semaphore (would also apply to readers) or individual spaces,
otherwise the LSBit of the count itself would indicate valid by
itself.

However according to the docs, there is a mode where it doesn't use
count at all, only valid

<A HREF="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/drivers/driver28.html">http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/drivers/driver28.html</A>

This looks like a way of emulating a pipe (one independent writer of
the data, one independent reader) or something like a mailbox without
using a real pipe, and it doesn't appear latency is being avoided.
Right now it could read valid and two equal counts while they are
being changed a nanosecond behind by a second processor  core - unless
I'm missing something - so you can have a race condition and
inconsistent data.  You can't with a pipe, or if you need to use SHM,
use two buffers, and the &quot;valid&quot; bit for each says whether they may be
written or read.

</I>&gt;<i> Bruce Lilly has done some work to develop a POSIX named shared memory
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to ntpd's refclock_shm.c / driver 28, which uses SysV shm
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;named&quot; using 32 bits, currently including the ascii for NTP (or ntp)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If ntpd is to grow the flavors of shared memory it understands to
</I>&gt;<i> include POSIX named shm, which would require a new driver or an
</I>&gt;<i> extension of the current refclock_shm.c, I think we should take the
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity presented to clean up the shared memory interface
</I>&gt;<i> contract. &#160;We could use the existing layout but since it requires new
</I>&gt;<i> code in ntpd and producers like gpsd to move to the different shm
</I>&gt;<i> namespace, there's no existing code to offended by a reshuffling of
</I>&gt;<i> layout and/or protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today's mode 1 approach is pretty good. &#160;As I mentioned on questions@
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer fixed sizes so the interface is resilient in the face
</I>&gt;<i> of a 64-bit ntpd and a 32-bit gpsd or vice-versa.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, I noticed the comments in our driver are one-sided,
</I>&gt;<i> describing only instructions for ntpd's interaction with the shared
</I>&gt;<i> memory without spelling out the writer's contract. &#160;Harlan raised a
</I>&gt;<i> concern about writers getting it wrong, and it took me a few guesses
</I>&gt;<i> to infer the right steps for a writer before resorting to gpsd source
</I>&gt;<i> code to to confirm. &#160;In short, writers increment count, then the
</I>&gt;<i> payload data, then increment count again, then set valid. &#160;Readers
</I>&gt;<i> fail if valid is zero, otherwise store count, copy payload, compare
</I>&gt;<i> count, fail if they don't match. &#160;Whether count matches or not, valid
</I>&gt;<i> is cleared.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure valid is achieving anything. &#160;Readers don't read when
</I>&gt;<i> it's zero, but that seems redundant to me with the count checking.
</I>&gt;<i> Also I don't like the reader resetting valid to 0 -- that shuts down
</I>&gt;<i> the possibility of multiple readers, and for what gain? &#160;valid is
</I>&gt;<i> cleared even when the reader abandoned the attempt because it was
</I>&gt;<i> mid-update, which seems particularly ill-advised to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are missing volatile qualifiers, as far as I see, the shared
</I>&gt;<i> memory should be accessed solely through volatile pointers, as it is
</I>&gt;<i> being modified by code outside the scope of the compiler's
</I>&gt;<i> optimizations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To facilitate correctness and avoid duplication of code, I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> see public header file lay out the structure and provide inline code
</I>&gt;<i> for producer and consumer. &#160;That would be eased by having not just one
</I>&gt;<i> structure, but a payload structure used by the producer and consumer
</I>&gt;<i> and a container structure with mode, count, and if needed, valid along
</I>&gt;<i> with an embedded payload struct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you believe we need both valid and count? &#160;Can you think of other
</I>&gt;<i> changes or extensions that might be an improvement in some way?
</I>&gt;<i>
