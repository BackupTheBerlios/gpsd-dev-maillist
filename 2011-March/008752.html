<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>   such a huge change needs to be on a feature branch, and not merged
</I>&gt;<i>   until it has no regressions.   (Everyone picks on autotools, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i>   today's scons is different, but every replacement I've seen either
</I>&gt;<i>   doesn't meet all the requirements or grows custom hairy bits, which is
</I>&gt;<i>   worse than standard hairy bits people understand.)
</I>
Nah, it's easier than that.  There's no reason we can't have an scons recipe
in mainline at the same time as the autotools one.  When it's polished enough,
we delete the autotools cruft.

&gt;<i>   before starting on  build changes, the requirements for a build system
</I>&gt;<i>   should be articulated (in a file checked in to master)
</I>
Or on the mailing list.  Like, here and now.

My main requirement for a new build system is that it *not be
autotools*.  We've got tz telling us he can't do outotools on his ARM
deployment target but can run Python. And I've hated autotools for
years anyway.  It's a rickety pile of hacks that breaks when you touch
anything.

I reached for scons because:

(a) I have previous good experience with it on a project much larger
and with a more complex dependency/option set than ours, Battle for
Wesnoth.

(b) Python.  Nice to not have to add another language dependency
Bonus goodness that it's a language I actually like.

(c) Er, what else is there?  OK, cmake, which strikes me as an
overcomplicated heap of crocks that replicates some of autotools's
design mistakes all too closely (the fact that it works by generating
Makefiles should scare you; it sure scares me).  And a bunch of
poorly-documented, not-ready-for-prime-time tools like WAF.
