<PRE>I can think of only one circumstance where it would work on Linux and
most other systems.

If the &quot;nice&quot; of the reader was so far below that of the writer that
the writer would have to complete and go to idle before the reader
would have a time-slice, then you would guarantee the write is atomic
so the reader would detect it.

Otherwise you cannot control when a timeslice will end, and it could
be in the middle of the respective memcpy's.

If the sentinels were uint8s and they went in OPPOSITE directions,
they might work at the same priority since the end sentinel would
differ from the start until the memcpy was complete, and the read
would always copy the start first.

So you would need forememcpy and backmemcpy with or without the
previously suggested minimal inlinable function.
