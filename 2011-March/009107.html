<PRE>One quick question - How large is this structure?  8k sounds extremely
large.  Also what are the chances of a CRC32 collision?  I've also
noted an ECC block could fixup unsynced areas.

And as the token embedded guy, let me also note another tradeoff is
resource usage.  If you write 32M the cache is all but guaranteed to
be flushed.

The one positive point is that the smaller processors don't have the
complex problems since they usually don't have caches, and the larger
ones have the resources to handle it.

A big and perhaps strange problem is that all the tools we would need
at a simple level are in the kernel(s).  The spinlocks and barriers
and other lightweight things.

It might almost pay to write a kernel module for synchronous shared memory.

</I>&gt;<i> (a) tz pointed out correctly that in a semaphore-based approach, readers
</I>&gt;<i> have to assert as well as writers - otherwise writer can start an update while
</I>&gt;<i> reader is still reading.
</I>
Or put simply, there is no purpose in a single thread locking a semaphore.

&gt;<i> (b) I then realized that under a correct semaphore implementation,
</I>&gt;<i> anybody dying while semaphore is asserted starves everybody else
</I>&gt;<i> (which we should have remembered from Operating Systems 101). &#160;This is

</I>
System semaphores are usually unlocked/destroyed/closed or whatever
when a process closes (part of the close on exit or kill cleanup).
