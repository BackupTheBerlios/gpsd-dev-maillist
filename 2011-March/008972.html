<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I'll try to recap as besst as I can.  The recent addition of volatile
</I>&gt;<i> to the SHM space keeps the C compiler from 'optimizing' the semaphore
</I>&gt;<i> writes into something non-functional.  For example, Hakan confirmed that
</I>&gt;<i> the increment before the writes and the increment after the writes (the
</I>&gt;<i> semaphore) were 'optimized' to a single addition of two.  The volatile
</I>&gt;<i> thus solves the single core/multi-thread problem.
</I>
I thought it would.  Good to have that confirmed.
 
&gt;<i> But we ALSO have the multi-core with cache problem.  Whereas the core
</I>&gt;<i> that gpsd is runnning on has conducted the semaphore writes into local
</I>&gt;<i> cache properly, the cache makes no guarantee on the order in which the
</I>&gt;<i> cache is flushed to main memory!  So the semaphore operations may get
</I>&gt;<i> reordered by the cache flush.  This appears to be very architecture
</I>&gt;<i> dependent and probably less of a problem in x86 than others.  Ouch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only way around this is a memory barrier, which is an instruction to
</I>&gt;<i> the CPU to flush its cache before continuing.
</I>
Ah, I see. Your &quot;memory barrier&quot; is a way around the problem of the
hardware-level memory controller on multicore system not enforcing cache
coherency itself.

I agree that this is a real problem in general.  I'm not very worried
about it in the use case we have for a shared-memory interface,
though.  I anticipate this interface being used in low-power,
single-core deployments like tz's Chumby.  I'd be OK with adding dire
&quot;Don't Go There On Multicore!&quot; warnings to the docs, if it came to that.

Anyway, since we need to solve this problem for ntpshm, whatever 
way of setting up memory barriers we develop for that case can be
re-used here.
