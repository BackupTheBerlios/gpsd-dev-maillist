There's some porting work to be done.  So far just x86 using threads
on Windows.  Still, I did include a dual-proc Pentium II 400MHz, which
predates Intel's strictest guarantees.  Below are the hour-long runs I
did.  Note the output is misleading, it still says 10 seconds when it
was in fact 3600.  Also despite the mention of debug\test_shm the
binary was fully optimized, including link-time code generation and
non-debug C runtime.  The source file is test-shm.c, the test_shm.exe
name is a result of quirk in how I set up the build here.

Dual Pentium II 400 MHz (dell poweredge 2300) two sockets:

counts[] = {1013285801,23545049282,53651425935,23533216365}

All threads done!

Thread 3 did 23533216365 iterations
counter_update = 524233674, counter_retry = 150581, timestamps_inconsistent = 0

I figured that was an interesting machine because Intel made certain
claims about the arch of Pentium III and later.

Dell Inspiron 9400 with Core2 T7200 2.0 GHz 1 socket:

C:\ntp\ntp-dev-shm-ringtest\ports\winnt\vs2008&gt;debug\shm_test
counts[] = {0,1,2,3}
Writer affinity = 1, old = 3
Reader 1 affinity = fffffffe, old = 3
Reader 2 affinity = fffffffe, old = 3
Reader 3 affinity = fffffffe, old = 3
Done waiting 10 seconds
counts[] = {1252798093,27888462205,27886570150,27668895725}

counter_update = 433190983, counter_retry = 807480, timestamps_inconsistent = 0

P4 2.8 GHz Stepping 1 (hyperthreaded to 2 &quot;cpus&quot;, 1 socket).  Dell
Poweredge 830:

C:\bin&gt;shm_test
counts[] = {0,1,2,3}
Writer affinity = 1, old = 3
Reader 1 affinity = fffffffe, old = 0
Reader 2 affinity = fffffffe, old = 0
Reader 3 affinity = fffffffe, old = 0

Nowhere near as interesting as Alpha or ARM, granted, and hard to
interpret without the source, which will have to wait for Terje.

Cheers,
Dave Hart
