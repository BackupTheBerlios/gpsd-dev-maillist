<PRE>Architecture/design discussion!  Yeah!

tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> First, yes, clean up the protocol, but look at it from what a client
</I>&gt;<i> might want - ala carte v.s.s combo meal, more structured rules, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> remove &quot;tag&quot; or replace it with something more specifically targeted
</I>&gt;<i> to a purpose.
</I>
&quot;A la carte&quot; scares me.  I fear ending up in a million petty fights
over what has to go in the supposedly minimalist responses. and
bloating the reporting code.  You won't get this without hard numbers
showing that &quot;combo meal&quot; is chewing up enough bandwidth or compute
time to be a performance problem.  Speculation that it *might* be an
issue will not persuade me.

&gt;<i>                       Add a debug or log or something to the watch if RAW
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't suffice.
</I>
Implementation already queued for after 2.96; the class is LOGMESSAGE. 
I borrowed Guido's time machine. :-)

&gt;<i> Maybe have a combined TPV/SKY such that TPV might include SKY if it
</I>&gt;<i> was updated.
</I>
No.  Orthogonality violation; also, TPV and SKY are typically emitted at 
different intervals. The POLL response gets away with this only because its
semantics are &quot;show me what you have&quot;.

&gt;<i> Add a simple json watch response for stuff like browsers or such with
</I>&gt;<i> just time/lat/lon/(alt)/speed/track - maybe this can be TPV.  This
</I>&gt;<i> should also be something returnable by xhttpdrequest and easily
</I>&gt;<i> processed by browser javascript.
</I>
See above on a la carte.  If you want this, prove that it's necessary.
My standard for proof will be strict.

&gt;<i> I can't comment on the other WATCH responses, at least not yet, but
</I>&gt;<i> those should also be cleaned up as necessary.  There should be one
</I>&gt;<i> JSON message format for each kind of data.  If something is
</I>&gt;<i> duplicated, we should split or combine the messages.
</I>
It's already designed this way.  If you think you've identified 
non-orthogonality or duplication, report it as a bug.
 
&gt;<i> For multiple devices, allow/select a &quot;best&quot; device based on fix (3d
</I>&gt;<i> over 2d), and DOP.  I have some code in mine for this which I can
</I>&gt;<i> adapt.  Currently gpsd allows for redundancy but clients would then
</I>&gt;<i> have to figure out which one is degraded or not tracking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For whether something should be inside or outside, one consideration
</I>&gt;<i> is if multiple clients would end up doing the same calculation most of
</I>&gt;<i> the time.  Do I really want firefox to have to pick out which GPS were
</I>&gt;<i> even valid or best?
</I>
OK, this is worth discussing.  Is there any reason we shouldn't handle
this by adding a rank attribute composed from mode and DOP?  Then an
application that just wants &quot;best&quot; could just pick the fix with rank 1.

&gt;<i> If we are going to include DoP calculations, XYZ might be good, but
</I>&gt;<i> elliptical axes might be better.  My apartment faces SE so I usually
</I>&gt;<i> get an arc in that direction.  X and Y are likely to be about equal,
</I>&gt;<i> but SW-NE and SE-NW are likely to be very different.
</I>
Maybe, but I don't know how to get elliptical axes from the skyview
covariance matrix.  You'd have to show me the math before I'd consider
this one seriously.
 
&gt;<i> We can leave the decimal points in for NOFLOAT - All I'm doing is
</I>&gt;<i> %d.%06d for output which is still probably much faster than %f.  (I do
</I>&gt;<i> similar for speed, track, pdop, but in milli-units).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we do &quot;NOFLOAT&quot; this way - is there a reason to keep FLOAT around
</I>&gt;<i> after it is complete?  It should be transparent except for the far
</I>&gt;<i> fewer CPU cycles.
</I>
I was assuming FLOAT would go away eventually.  You've already won this
one, provided you follow through with code.

&gt;<i> POLL should return the same thing WATCH does, maybe with one more
</I>&gt;<i> layer of class encapsulation.
</I>
This didn't make any sense.  WATCH just sets reporting policy; POLL
returns fix data.  I can't imagine how confusing the two could be 
useful.

&gt;<i> The return size for poll will need to be much larger.  TPV + SKY for
</I>&gt;<i> ONE GPS is over 900 characters.  I think even the existing format
</I>&gt;<i> which only has a few less characters and
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;{&quot;PRN&quot;:19,&quot;el&quot;:39,&quot;az&quot;:163,&quot;ss&quot;:37,&quot;used&quot;:true},&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  is 49 characters, so can be around 700 per GPS (12 in view plus two
</I>&gt;<i> WAAS).  Three or more will overflow the 1536 limit. unless we do
</I>&gt;<i> something like BEGIN / DEVICE 1 WATCH JSON / DEVICE 2 WATCH JSON... /
</I>&gt;<i> END. with a guarantee that even if WATCH is active or DEVICE changes
</I>&gt;<i> that it won't interrupt.
</I>
You're probably right.  The only reason the max response size is so small
is that I didn't want to impose huge buffers on embedded deployments.
You are an embedded deployment; what size do you think would be reasonable.

&gt;<i> I think all the pieces are there, but they could be arranged more
</I>&gt;<i> conveniently for a client.
</I>
Sorry, pieces of what?

&gt;<i> Suggestion, and I don't know if this is practical or useful in your
</I>&gt;<i> context but it is in mine - add an optional millisecond &quot;systime&quot; -
</I>&gt;<i> the time field is what comes from the messages, but systime would
</I>&gt;<i> track the arrival time of the raw messages.  Maybe raw only, but you
</I>&gt;<i> might get some measure of latency and if there are multiple interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> or sensors it would give a finer and consistent resolution than the
</I>&gt;<i> GPS timestamp.  I would expect it to be offset, but would help measure
</I>&gt;<i> the latency, e.g. 43050 - $GPRMC ...43.000....  So you could more
</I>&gt;<i> easily match actual position at higher rates with different sources.
</I>
I don't understand your use case.  How would this help you, exactly?

&gt;<i> Note that higher baud rates would help to reduce latency.
</I>
Not by as much as you think.  I profiled this; it turns out that for 
a typical NMEA device, 4800bs is a bit too slow, 9600 suffices, and
more than that is overkill.  White paper, with numbers and profile graphs, 
is on the website.
