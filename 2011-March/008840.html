</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I see part of the problem. &#160;You appear to be expecting the

</I>&gt;<i> lockstep protocol. &#160;It isn't. &#160;There is not anywhere in it anything
</I>&gt;<i> like synchronous command/response transaction. &#160;There can't be,
</I>&gt;<i> because the devices can insert arbitrary delays before they respond to
</I>&gt;<i> command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There were a couple of major design errors in the old protocol. &#160;One
</I>&gt;<i> of them is that it pretended to be synchronous. It took me longer
</I>&gt;<i> than it should have to realize how many problems this was causing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The right way to think about it is that the daemon is going to spew
</I>&gt;<i> reports at you at random intervals. &#160;What *kind* of reports is
</I>&gt;<i> controlled mainly by the WATCH state, with a small random delay after
</I>&gt;<i> you set it. &#160;Until a WATCH policy is set, all you'll see is device connect
</I>&gt;<i> and device disconnect notifications (after the initial VERSION and
</I>&gt;<i> DEVICES reports).
</I>
For example:

&quot;The daemon occasionally ships a bare DEVICE object to the client
(that is, one not inside a DEVICES wrapper). The data content of these
objects will be described later in the section covering
notifications.&quot;

There are bits and pieces in other sections, mostly not having
anything to do with notification, but no &quot;Notifications&quot; section as
such.

&gt;<i> It's up to client code to aggregate the state from these events. &#160;The C
</I>&gt;<i> library binding does this for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I was expecting is something like (don't take these to be accurate)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ?WATCH= MUST specify parameters in a specific order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ?WATCH= SHOULD specify enable last in the list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ?WATCH= MAY specify parameters in any order
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The third alternative is correct. I just added this to the manual
</I>&gt;<i> page: &quot;The order of JSON attributes within a response object is never
</I>&gt;<i> significant, and you may specify attributes in commands in any order.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I also can't seem to find a way to only watch for position TPV and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not get the SKY but I might just be dense - I don't think browser
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> location will need SKY).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is at present no way to specify this. &#160;In general, the policy
</I>&gt;<i> options in WATCH specify what formats the daemon should ship reports
</I>&gt;<i> in, but do not set filters on which reports should be shipped. When
</I>&gt;<i> you set WATCH, all devices will ship you every report they can deliver;
</I>&gt;<i> it's up to the client to do content filtering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason it's designed this way is that even at full flood from several
</I>&gt;<i> devices the data volume is not very high; for most of each second the
</I>&gt;<i> socket will be idle. &#160;Content filtering would add complexity that I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not yet convinced is necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a measured need to throttle back the amount of sending,
</I>&gt;<i> then I might consider adding something like &quot;filter&quot;:{&quot;TPV&quot;} to WATCH.
</I>&gt;<i> But it would have to be a *measured* need, with profiling, not one
</I>&gt;<i> just guessed at. &#160;I am concerned to avoid code bloat.
</I>
One of the things I am trying to do is to figure out how to use
xhttpdrequest to get something from gpsd-ng - use an existing json
coder efficiently instead of writing up a new blob of json
specifically for it.  Part of that path is getting my version to emit
the same or very similar output and adjusting the javascript to it.

Here is where I find WATCH to have a problem.  You could simply dump
everything and allow the client to pick out the bits (as they are
clearly labeled and easily parsed).  But you do split at least raw,
(pseudo)nmea, and json as individually controllable.

One of the most common cases would be simply telling the browsers in
the system the current latitude and longitude as that is all they want
or need for geolocation.  Bloating every client to make gpsd thin
would be counterproductive.

&gt;<i>From the client's point of view, I want lat/lon, and maybe altitude
</I>and heading if I'm doing google earth.  I also don't need every tiny
update on my 10Hz stream.  I might also want the last stale reading
(which WATCH won't return and I don't think POLL will even if we just
entered a parking structure - we might need a &quot;keep on always&quot;, or
&quot;poll every N minute&quot; option).  Ending up with the entire USA on the
map instead of the entrance to the structure or a street a mile away
is a fail - and too many implementations (that don't use gpsd) do this
and have no option.

I can use something like POLL, but it would help if I can trim the
data it returns to just what I need.  Even now what happens if you
have more than one GPS device and the combined fix and sky data
exceeds 1024 bytes (listed as a hard limit)?

Worse (noting what 10Hz NMEA does to my jailbroken slow iPod touch),
each of these events typically are acted upon, so the small amount of
power gpsd might consume causes a cascade of reloading or scrolling a
whole screen almost constantly to move it 2-3 pixels every fraction of
a second.  From the other side, if I wanted to use geolocation, I
would only want a notification every N seconds (even if redundant,
sort of a keep-alive, or just a PING), or if the location changed more
than a given amount.  If I 'm standing still, the map stays fixed and
no activity.  If I move slowly, it reloads or shifts every minute or
so to keep me on the map.  If I'm driving across the freeways out
west, every few seconds or every second is not unwarranted.

Legacy GPSD was easy to pick out.  By having variable JSON it is only
easier to pick out if you have a library that can parse it and do
exceptions right if things are missing or coding around it.  And it is
likely to be all done in doubles anyway negating having NOFLOAT for
gpsd itself.

That is probably what the web interface will implement in some form.
There should be a way of having some simple http request return just a
few select pieces of data - JSON and/or XML.  But this would be an
alternate API.

&gt;&gt;<i> The response MUST return the following:... &#160;The response SHOULD ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The response MAY... &#160;Both for content and ordering.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For the TPV - are the device and tag fields MUST, SHOULD, or MAY?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They might be for libgps, but not if you are decoding the json
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Look in the attribute tables. There's a column to tell you whether or
</I>&gt;<i> not an attribute is optional; that's your MUST. &#160;If you want or need
</I>&gt;<i> more detailed specification than that, explain and I'll try to fill it
</I>&gt;<i> in.
</I>
It just says always, and then typically for only the class and one
other entry.  Some of the fields are only present if mode is 2, some
if 3.  Will alt always be there if mode is 3?  Can it be there (maybe
stale) if mode is 2?

If there is supposed to be some system to this, it should be
explained.  If it is all ad-hoc/willy-nilly, you should add regression
tests to randomize which fields are there or not.  (It doesn't even
say that you will get both lat and lon or neither).

&gt;&gt;<i> This might not belong on the gpsd.8 manpage, but it is a detailed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol and it isn't really documented as a protocol. &#160;Think RFC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (actually that would be a good idea - do an RFC to document this).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There should be a certain minimum MUST.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The actual protocol is whatever standard you want to set and has to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> precisely describe the behavior of whatever implementation. &#160;Right now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is &quot;whatever the code does&quot; and the code can change. &#160;If some are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> depending on specific fields and they go away, it will break.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intent is that the protocol is documented with RFC completeness
</I>&gt;<i> on gpsd(8). &#160;If I'm not achieving that, do criticize the docs so
</I>&gt;<i> I can fix them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the problems with the original GPSD is it was quirky - the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commands and responses were all ad-hoc but at least were uniform and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constant.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JSON creates the problem because it is &quot;extensible&quot;, but also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contractable, e.g. no altitude for 2d. &#160;But is this behavior set in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stone, or ad-hoc?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It depends on what the underlying device sends. &#160;If you don't have a 3D
</I>&gt;<i> fix, TPV won't report altitude. &#160;It really can't be any other way.
</I>
It could have &quot;alt&quot;:null.  You are documenting what the current code
actually does, not what a conforming implementation may/should/must
do.  And you are explaining it here, not on the manpage.  All the
manpage says for alt is Always:no.

The manpage should then explain the behavior of the code, not the
other way around.

And what is required by libgpsd? - if it depends on undocumented or
not fully documented gpsd behavior, then there are problems.  For that
matter, if I understand, you need to know the unix device name of the
GPS even if there is only one in the system, or it moves (bluetooth on
an new rfcommN), and as far as I can tell there isn't anything in
libgpsd which can return a list of devices.  And you can pick the
disabled GPS instead of the working one.

In my implementation, I only return one set of fix/sky data directly,
but use the fix from the device with the best fix/DoP.  Clients won't
have to do it or even have multiple &quot;good&quot; data but jitter between the
two if they don't pick one out.

Even if I merge my implementation into gpsd-ng to make it NOFLOAT -
which I really want to do - I'm in a position to ask the questions as
if I was going to implement it ex nihilo.  Also I have all the data in
mine that it should be simple just to follow the manpage as a recipe
and just implement the formats and behaviors such that clients
shouldn't care which one is running.  But it isn't that way, at least
not yet.  That is why the questions on why &quot;tag&quot; exists - I don't have
anything similar and it sounds like something implementation specific
even if useful.  And that is why the other questions.  I know what
gpsd-ng does because the code is easily readable, but there isn't a
why it does what it does but not something else.
