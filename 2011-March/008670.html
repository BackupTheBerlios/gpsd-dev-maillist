<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> It is a ground-up reimplementation I originally started for the
</I>&gt;<i> Kyocera KR1 EVDO to WIFI router- sort of a very early mifi with
</I>&gt;<i> hackable firmware.  It logs data to KMZ files.  This was a 100Mhz MIPS
</I>&gt;<i> processor, and I was under 5% cpu.
</I>
Is GPSD over this figure?  How would I measure it?

How do you get a performance advantage over GPSD stripped to handle NMEA only?

I think I understand about the FP issue.  In an NMEA-only GPSD build I
think the only FP would be in the error-modeling code and the handling
of $PGRME/$GPGBS.  Please consider implementing a NOFLOAT config
option for GPSD that would condition all that stuff out - I'd
cheerfully help with this.
 
&gt;<i> That was the basis for the nokia tablet version that also did vehicle logging.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My old version for the nSeries tablets (also in maemo.org's diablo repository)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/tz1/minigpsd">https://github.com/tz1/minigpsd</A>
</I>
I'm looking at both that and webgpsd now.
 
&gt;<i> The current work in progress - it uses HTML5 canvas to show the
</I>&gt;<i> satellite status page and a few other things.  I've been busy and
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for the feature freeze, and need to get to work (it
</I>&gt;<i> multiplexes multiple GPS sources as well as other data to log).  I
</I>&gt;<i> really need to do something about the security, but I need to verify
</I>&gt;<i> the featureset first:  For now the multiple GPSes come from Python
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, e.g. the bluetooth version even does pairing, and there is a
</I>&gt;<i> log-replay feeder.

If you're determined to reimplement I can't prevent it, of course.
But GPSD is designed to be stripped down to a very small set of
running gears for NMEA-only devices; I wish you'd work with us to
tighten up and slim down that build, rather than duplicating a lot of
our effort.

Do you know about Gypsy?  It too, was an attempt to ship a leaner, meaner
GPSD replacement. It was a technical success at its (necessarily) more 
limited goals, but an uptake failure.  There was pro-forma
support for it put into in a couple of projects like OpenMoko from
back around when Gypsy launched in 2008, but AFAIK nobody's actually
using it for production. The last code commit was eleven months ago.

Gypsy stalled out for several reasons.  One is that GPSD has a level
of name recognition and a reliability track record that's tough for
any new competitor to match. Another is that the application domain is
so replete with hardware quirks and protocol black art that it puts a
*very* heavy premium on kinds of domain experience that new projects
can't readily duplicate.  A third is our test infrastructure; more
than half the problem is demonstrating that the code is correct and
keeping it stable against the tendency to bitrot.

When I look at minigpsd/webgpsd, I see the second coming of Gypsy.
You clearly have some good ideas, and you've chosen a mission that a
full-featured GPSD build is probably too heavyweight for.  But, honestly, I
think you're likely to stall out in the same way Gypsy did.

It would be better for everyone if we co-opted each other.  There's
precedent; the lead dev of another GPSD competitor, ngpsd, was welcomed
here and active for several years.  He decided ngpsd was unnecessary, 
and we still have the specialized client he wrote under maintainance.

You'd get the GPSD test infrastructure, which is no trivial thing.
I'd like to have your Bluetooth-pairing and HTML5 support.  More
generally, I'd *love* to have a dev on the project who cares day-to-day 
about the low-power embedded stuff - I want to cover those devices,
but I don't have the right hardware-test setup to do it.

Gypsy was a well-intentioned waste of talent. Please, let's work together 
to avoid another such.
