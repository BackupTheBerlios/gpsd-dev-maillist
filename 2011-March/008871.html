<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Currently there are only four data objects.  I don't see this
</I>&gt;<i> increasing.  Adding an all/tpv/sky...etc on/off control and doing it
</I>&gt;<i> per-device shouldn't be that hard.  I'm not saying the content should
</I>&gt;<i> be ala carte, but which messages.  You are already ala carte with
</I>&gt;<i> respect to json v.s. pseudo-nmea v.s. raw.
</I>
Oh, I see.  You want something like this, do you?

    ?WATCH={&quot;enable&quot;:true,&quot;json&quot;:true,&quot;classes&quot;:{&quot;TPV&quot;}}

That wouldn't be unreasonable.  I'll have to look at the implementation weight.

&gt;<i> &gt; No. &#160;Orthogonality violation; also, TPV and SKY are typically emitted at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different intervals. The POLL response gets away with this only because its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantics are &quot;show me what you have&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if one of the binary protocols or a new one emitted parts of any of
</I>&gt;<i> the existing data objects at different intervals then we should split
</I>&gt;<i> them up?
</I>
That is implied, yes.  Fortunately there's sort of a standard meta-model
of what these things ship that applies across all the devices we've seen; 
it's what TPV and SKY were abstracted from.  I'm not actually worried 
about a device breaking it - could happen, but the probability seems low.
 
&gt;<i> OK, I agree that there should b e just one TPV data object.  So I
</I>&gt;<i> would have to make an xhttpdrequest for TPV and I would get back a TPV
</I>&gt;<i> identical to what is formatted if WATCH is enabled or within a POLL.
</I>&gt;<i> Same for SKY.
</I>
What would be wrong with making a ?POLL; request?  Why have multiple ways
of doing the same thing?

&gt;<i> Note to self - check/audit the data objects.
</I>
Yes, please do.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; OK, this is worth discussing. &#160;Is there any reason we shouldn't handle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this by adding a rank attribute composed from mode and DOP? &#160;Then an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application that just wants &quot;best&quot; could just pick the fix with rank 1.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is a little more subtle - there needs to be a bit of hysteresis and
</I>&gt;<i> the first two might be equally good, but you would want number 1 to be
</I>&gt;<i> sticky so you don't oscillate since the fixes will tend to have
</I>&gt;<i> persistent differences.
</I>
Agreed.  Good thinking!  OK, you own this piece.  Write the ranking
algorithm the way you want it. I'll audit.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If we are going to include DoP calculations, XYZ might be good, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; elliptical axes might be better. &#160;My apartment faces SE so I usually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; get an arc in that direction. &#160;X and Y are likely to be about equal,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but SW-NE and SE-NW are likely to be very different.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe, but I don't know how to get elliptical axes from the skyview
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; covariance matrix. &#160;You'd have to show me the math before I'd consider
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this one seriously.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will have to do a little searching.  I know one of the GPS units I
</I>&gt;<i> have or were considering had this as part of some binary output.
</I>
Deferred, then.  We have enough other things to tackle.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We can leave the decimal points in for NOFLOAT - All I'm doing is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; %d.%06d for output which is still probably much faster than %f. &#160;(I do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; similar for speed, track, pdop, but in milli-units).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If we do &quot;NOFLOAT&quot; this way - is there a reason to keep FLOAT around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; after it is complete? &#160;It should be transparent except for the far
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fewer CPU cycles.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was assuming FLOAT would go away eventually. &#160;You've already won this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one, provided you follow through with code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as the 3.0 branch is set up I can get started.  It won't be
</I>&gt;<i> too quick and there will be a big crunch when we replace the instances
</I>&gt;<i> of double in the fix structure.
</I>
We don't do long-lived branches in the public repo - I view them
mainly as a way for code to bit-rot in isolation, and prefer a model
in which features are merged into mainline as rapidly as possible
along with tests to verify them.

If you want to create local feature branches in your repo, go right ahead.
Make lots of little ones and assume they'll be cherry-picked into mainline
through your patch submissions.  If you code as good a game as you talk 
you'll get dev access after a patch or three and can start doing those
cherry-picks yourself.

I'm not anticipating outright replacing the doubles for some time.
For a while that struct is going to have two different shapes depending
on whether or not NOFLOAT is defined.

&gt;<i> &gt; You're probably right. &#160;The only reason the max response size is so small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is that I didn't want to impose huge buffers on embedded deployments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You are an embedded deployment; what size do you think would be reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would just expand the maximum size of any message to 4096 - we
</I>&gt;<i> probably won't go near it, but I can imagine this being used to test
</I>&gt;<i> an array of devices.  I can't come up with a limit because this is
</I>&gt;<i> defined to be monolithic.
</I>
4096 seems reasonable.  Uh oh, though - if I'm going to do that I have to
do it *now*.  Otherwise we'll break the ABI again when the size goes up;
there's a buffer pegged to that size in struct gps_data_t.
 
&gt;<i> That is why I'm suggesting replacing the current method with just
</I>&gt;<i> returning each of the data objects available - also sorted per device
</I>&gt;<i> (the current one has tpv1 tpv2 tpv3 sky1 sky2 sky3, I would do tpv1
</I>&gt;<i> sky1 tpv2 sky2...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You might encapsulate it in a poll-with response number class or
</I>&gt;<i> something, but as I suggested:
</I>&gt;<i> POLL DATA OBJECT BEGIN
</I>&gt;<i> TPV for device 1 (should be identical to the last one emitted by a WATCH)
</I>&gt;<i> SKY1 (device can be by rank or arbitrary order - but rank will then
</I>&gt;<i> have to go somewhere).
</I>&gt;<i> (others)1
</I>&gt;<i> TPV2
</I>&gt;<i> SKY2
</I>&gt;<i> (others)2
</I>&gt;<i> POLL DATA OBJECT END
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would not perfer this, but it could be encapsulated in a
</I>&gt;<i> {class:&quot;poll&quot;,serno:&quot;1234&quot;, {class:&quot;TPV... to keep things straight,
</I>&gt;<i> but begin/end should be sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There would be no arbitrary limits on the data buffer size.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With a guarantee that no notifications would occur within the poll output.
</I>
This will require more discussion and a more fleshed-out proposal from you.  

I will tell you up front that I am going to be hostile by instinct to
any proposal that requires clients to do parsing that is stateful
above the JSON-object level.  Given that we're using JSON, I view that
sort of statefulness requirement as bad protocol-design practice, a
recipe for semi-infinite amounts of bugs and pain. I won't go there
without a really compelling reason.

I realize that this may imply huge JSON objects in some situations.
So be it.  The advantages of every report being an atomic object with
really well-defined syntactic boundaries are, IMO, worth accepting
that tradeoff for - really, this is the whole point of using a JSON
profile in the first place. Convincing me otherwise wouldn't be utterly 
impossible, but you'd have to work very hard to do it.

&gt;<i> See baud below for an example, though it is debugging, but if I am
</I>&gt;<i> trying to correlate or sort data that might not be coming from GPSD.
</I>&gt;<i> A different program might not be able to use the GPS clock, and might
</I>&gt;<i> be coming in with more or less latency.
</I>
Noted as a possibility: A WATCH attribute that enables systime.  There's
some precedent for this, there's already an attribute to enable timing
sentences usable for profiling.
