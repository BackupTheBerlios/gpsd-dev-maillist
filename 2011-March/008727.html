&gt;<i> This is a consolidated reply to your five postings around the topic of
</I>&gt;<i> stripping down gpsd to a minimalist, NMEA-only version using no
</I>&gt;<i> floating point and suitable for low-power embedded development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Summary: it seems to me to break down into two tasks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) De-autoconfiscating the build system
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Cleaning floating point usage out of the core structures and NMEA driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first task is relatively easy, and should come first. &#160;The second will
</I>&gt;<i> be messy and difficult. &#160;This is not going to happen before we ship the
</I>&gt;<i> 2.96 release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One major question I have for you is: could you live with scons as a
</I>&gt;<i> build system? That would be a relatively easy transition.
</I>
Yes, provided it didn't have similar dependencies - can I compile it
quickly and easily on an ARM based system without having to install
half of the existing auto-tools and libs in a current linux distro
either for sconf or for the target.

&gt;<i> Answers to your more specific questions and comments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>First, I didn't know until your message it would be possible to build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>such a version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, all you have to do is configure out all drivers except NMEA. &#160;Most of
</I>&gt;<i> the code goes away if a raft of stuff like binary-GPS drivers and support
</I>&gt;<i> for RTCM2 and RTCM3 and AIS are configured out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I might try, but I know I don't have anything to do libtool for MIPS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This falls under &quot;getting rid of autotools&quot;. &#160;Autotools is full of
</I>&gt;<i> horrible botches; libtool is one of the worst. &#160;Shooting it through
</I>&gt;<i> the head would be a positive pleasure.
</I>
I would prefer the kneecaps, and some artery but you are the gun expert :).

&gt;&gt;<i>There are a bunch of options to disable things and I'm not sure which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are features and which are protocols. &#160;there is no --minimalist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>option, and there is nothing that I can find describing how I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>build what you are specifically talking about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Look at this listing from the end of configure:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Are the following actually protocols?

&gt;<i> GPSclock &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: yes
</I>
&gt;<i> Timing support &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: yes
</I>
&gt;<i> Client debugging support: yes
</I>
And don't I also need to pull some of the following:

&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Daemon Features
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;---------------
</I>&gt;<i> NTP SHM &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; : yes
</I>&gt;<i> NTP PPS &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; : yes
</I>...

&gt;<i> It should tell you what you need to know. &#160;The place you probably want to
</I>&gt;<i> start is by turning off all protocols other than NMEA and the NTP support.
</I>
I'll give it a try when I have a chance.

&gt;&gt;<i>I am more efficient because I have highly optimized parser code. &#160;The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>NMEA output is a short string of integer characters &#160;Everything else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>has a very short path..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't quite inderstand this. &#160;What &quot;NMEA output&quot; is a short string of
</I>&gt;<i> integers? &#160;NMEA sentences generally at least have an alphabetic tag.
</I>
The alphabetic tag is used with strncmp in an if-else tree.

&gt;&gt;<i>for minigpsd, I was using shared memory, so I could just open and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>overlay the section and updates would be instantaneous - and no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>message passing or repackaging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand this, either. &#160;Was it your method of communicating
</I>&gt;<i> to clients?
</I>
Yes.  The clients would typically poll and run slower than the GPS
(5-10Hz) or other data, or in the case of moving a map pin, you only
need check every few seconds, then just read out the values.

&gt;&gt;<i>Even in the makefile, I had CFLAGS += `pkgconfig...&quot; for gconf instead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of the autogen stuff, and maemo uses debian packaging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We might end up using something like your pkgconfig trick. &#160;But it would
</I>&gt;<i> be far easier to transion off autotools if you could use scons as your
</I>&gt;<i> build system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>No, right at the top of driver_nmea.c where it picks out the lat/lon:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are right. &#160;There is much more float dependency in the code than I
</I>&gt;<i> understood. &#160;We'll have to deal with this, and it's going to be a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of work. &#160;But I've taken some first steps.
</I>
Even if you were to use sscanf into an integer type, sscanf is a lot
of code to pick out numbers.

&gt;&gt;<i>It would be intertesting to compare ncycles
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would you recommend we do this?
</I>
Come up with the stripped NMEA gpsd-ng 2.96, and run it with a 10Hz
NMEA GPS on a soft-float ARM embedded board like a chumby hacker
board, or maybe an early jailbroken iPhone or not-top/thin client.

Compile my version (though I do things like logging to KML files and I
don't have a way to #ifdef them out).

Does gdb have some fine timer so you could time between two
breakpoints (or if there were a hardware timer available you could
just add a line before an after to measure microseconds, or use a port
and an oScope).

You could run both for say 1000 seconds using time and show the
system/user time.  Or check the CPU load with top or something.

I have one master select() it sits at so you could also use a digital
storage scope or something from the point the select returns to the
point it starts again if you want overall processing time.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I keep everyting in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>micro-degrees (could go to tenth-of if any hardware was that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>accurate).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Diego Berge had some thoughts about this which I'll get to later in this reply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>As I've shown, you are using libraries and floats everywhere. &#160;We're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>talking extreme liposuction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. &#160;But it's the right thing to do. &#160;We'll just have to take it in steps.
</I>
OK - we're agreed here in that case.  I didn't want to suggest it
earlier since I didn't think it would be considered because of the
size of the task.

&gt;&gt;<i>Most distros probably just use the defaults or nearso.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the OpenMoko build is NMEA-only.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The other half is I can't use gpsd-ng since I can't (and probably will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never be able to) inline external data. &#160;You will have water depth or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>whatever merged into the info stream, but I can't merge my engine rpm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and fuel consumption data. &#160;I have other sensors, some might get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>adopted, others not. &#160;I need multiple redundant failover GPSes but one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>master value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We merge water depth and so forth only if those drivers are enabled.
</I>&gt;<i> If you strip down to NMEA support only you'll get TPV and SKY and
</I>&gt;<i> that's about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Also, even if I did - and I might take a look with your help and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>comments - I don't see the necessary features being in gpsd-ng, so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have to write my version anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What features do you need that we don't have?
</I>
A way to inline external data merged with the NMEA (or even binary)
data streams.  In order to log data and keep it straight I even have a
5 digit millisecond tick time so I know when some external sensor data
came in v.s. when the NMEA sentence came in.  I also log everything
for post-processing (so if I need the DoP, it will be there)

&gt;&gt;<i>As a postscript, looking at gps.h, &quot;double&quot; is everywhere. &#160;I'm in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>microdegrees (could go to 100 nanodegrees). &#160;Even time portion of an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>hour is double.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem acknowledged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I am really willing to help do a nofloat version, but then would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>anything still work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my thought about how to get there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Introduce a NOFLOAT conditional. &#160;Outside it, do what we do now.
</I>&gt;<i> Inside it, various structure members change type. &#160;Timestamps become
</I>&gt;<i> milliseconds rather than seconds with a fractional part. &#160;Degrees become
</I>&gt;<i> microdegrees or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Currently in JSON reporting, some types of obects (notably AIS
</I>&gt;<i> sentences) may be reported in either scaled or unscaled format.
</I>&gt;<i> (You tell the difference by a &quot;scaled&quot; attribute.) &#160;Currently
</I>&gt;<i> TPVs are always reported in a scaled form. &#160;Undeer NOFLOAT we
</I>&gt;<i> report them unscaled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The original target MIPS and the lower-end ARM processors don't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>an FPU, and most FPUs aren't single cycle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. &#160;Which is why at the *next* major API break forced on us for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever other reason, NOFLOAT goes away and we're all fixed-point all
</I>&gt;<i> the time.
</I>
Sounds reasonable.

&gt;&gt;<i>That said, the web interface and the rest should be fairly agnostic or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>easily modified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. I would welcome that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your third post, you give this list of requirements:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What I need from a gpsd to work in embedded:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1. No floating point or other big libraries. &#160;This might or might not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mean NMEA only, but from the binary formats I've seen it isn't that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>hard to do fixed point parsing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think, at least at first, it will be acceptable to support NMEA only
</I>&gt;<i> in NOFLOAT. &#160;We'll get some others for free; the AIS driver, for example
</I>&gt;<i> is already integer-clean with no floats or doubles.
</I>
Yes, start with NOFLOAT for NMEA and slowly move it out to the rest of
the protocols.

&gt;&gt;<i>2. I need to be able to type &quot;make -f Makefile.gpsdmini&quot; instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>requiring the entire GNU autobuild environment. &#160;Even if the binary is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a bit chubby (I suggested drivers as plugins earlier) memory is rarely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a limit and you can -DNMEA_ONLY if it comes to that. &#160;Nothing but -lc,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>i.e. the implicit link path, or maybe one or two if they are cross
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>system and really needed, but I can't think of any. &#160;No libtool,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>automake, autoconf, or the rest should be necessary for gpsd itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I could do this too once I see how to do a minimalist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>makefile/config.h.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We agree on getting rid of autotools. &#160;But do you really need a
</I>&gt;<i> flat makefile or can you use scons?
</I>
Again, as long as scons is mostly self-contained, it should be OK.
(Taking a further look, it is basically plain Python, no fancy extra
libs, so yes)

&gt;&gt;<i>3. An API for interleaving events or other sensor data. &#160;I can have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>another interface picking up other data, but if the line of text comes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>in before the GPS line of text, it needs to go out, send the event, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>otherwise coordinate with it. &#160;For example, my dashboard app needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>engine RPM. &#160;I could pull everything separately and merge it but each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>app would have to do that. &#160;Maybe a driver_xeno.c that just opens a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>listen/read socket and provides text strings out the JSON if a watch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is set. &#160;I don't need much, but I do need a way to merge and sync
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>data. &#160;(I'm assuming the multiple source GPS and failover is already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>there). &#160;If this is decided, it might clear up trouble on whether to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>include some of the other data GPS devices provide which aren't nav
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>data like water temp. &#160;Anything not in the main nav structure becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>available through a standard catch-all method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The data interleaving won't be difficult. &#160;And yes, multiple source
</I>&gt;<i> GPS and failover is already there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>And yes, I would prefer to get gpsd-ng down to embedded size rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>than doing a separate codebase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Better for all involved, yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Diego Berge wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>One of the requirements that make it possible is that data obtained

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. I think we're pretty much there for consumer-grade hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> tz's microdegrees is enough for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Now, while there appear to be very valid and worthwhile reasons that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>would make it desirable for gpsd to work exclusively at the integer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>level, as discussed on this insightful thread, I suggest that in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to preserve precision at the level at which current and near-term
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>future geomatics products work, data representation in the order of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>10^9 sexagesimal degrees would be required (that's around 1/10th of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>millimetre of a great circle). &#160;Unfortunately that level of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>granularity cannot be had with 32 bit integers, so 64 bit storage is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the minimum (2^32 &lt; 360/10^-9 &lt; 2^64).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Crash landing. &#160;We may get there someday, but in the near-term future
</I>&gt;<i> the goal of supporting embedded means we *can't* work only on 64-bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So here's what we'll do. &#160;Angular measurement under NOFLOAT will get
</I>&gt;<i> its own integer type, angle_t or something. &#160;We'll set the units
</I>&gt;<i> at microdegrees with a future direction that they may change to
</I>&gt;<i> nanodegrees in a future major API revision. &#160;We'll do code-hygiene
</I>&gt;<i> things, like having a scale constant rather than magic numbers, to
</I>&gt;<i> make that easy.
</I>
The units could be in 100 nano-degree increments without overflowing,
and in an separate communication, I suggested if there are
nano-degrees, they can be in a second integer which is otherwise
always zero, either a short or something such that ((microdegrees &lt;&lt;
32) | fractional &amp; 0xffffffff) would produce the precision where
needed.  There are some RTK systems that do go to centimeter precision
(100nano).

The only thing I can think of favoring microdegees over 100n is that
it is at one of those multiple-of-three decimal splits.

&gt;&gt;<i>P.S.: Back in 2005, I recall there was a similar issue with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>output precision of lat/lon values, but that was only a matter of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>changing the printf() spec, an easy patch to apply (which I did).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And much appreciated. &#160;You do good work, Diego; I wish you were more
</I>&gt;<i> active here.
