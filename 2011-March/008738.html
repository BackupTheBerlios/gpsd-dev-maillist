If I'm not building the library, I don't think I would need libtool.

Maybe I should have added NMEA.  I don't know the statistics,  but
&quot;everybody&quot; is probably under 2% for those who don't have something
that can produce NMEA.  Add one or two others and you probably get to
.01%.  Other than the regression testbench, how many would actually
use more than 2 or 3 drivers?  I'm all for a gpsd-ng-full version, but
also for a narrower standard version and a lightweight version.

That is one of the reasons I asked about plugins.  Things with drivers
bloat if they don't use this kind of architecture - no one would think
that the linux USB subsystem or Xorg should have one monolithic
&quot;everything&quot; module.  Since were aren't going to do plugins, it makes
sense to have in addition to the ala-carte settings, a set of build
options for light, normal, everything.

The current or the ancient version?

</I>
My point exactly - one of the reasons for autotools is/was --build
--host and --target.  You are building everything on a fast arm, but I
don't have a fast arm.  I do have a multicore x86_64 which is fast,
but can I build debian arm on that?  Not using something like
scratchbox with QEMU.

&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone actually tried moving the toolchain or libraries into

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Would be nice if we could use dietlibc instead of libc, though.
</I>
I asked about the regression test.  If the build breaks on X, it
prevents the release.  Not if it happens to work on what it is tried
on ad-hoc.  I've already pointed out that there are places it would be
difficult or impossible for me to build on because autotools isn't
setup to support them.  If gpsd was specifically targeted at such big
systems and had something which required all this as a dependency,
like, say, GTK+, I wouldn't complain, but this is supposed to be a
daemon running in the background and for all the churn and tests it
seems only to depend on some version of posix libc and common
includes.

Perhaps the library should be moved to its own directory and built
optionally but use its own autogen and such if it requires all that.
That part probably has all the build complexity like GTK+.  But gpsd
itself shouldn't be burdened by every requirement the library has.
