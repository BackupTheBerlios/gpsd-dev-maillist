<PRE>Well, as far as answer 1 is concerned, I am aware of that, but
both being open source projects, it is possible to carry on the
modification on both, and it will be all the easier than
compatibility is ensured.

And yes, reading the comment on the shm-related code make it
extremely likely that gpsd behaves according to ntpd's
expectances.

For the answer #2, well, the main reason I would push forward is
code readability : whenever you call something &quot;semaphore&quot;,
anyone knows what we should be doing. Plus the fact that the
processus as implemented today does assume a unique writer but
does nothing to enforce it. As a matter of facts, not much can
be easily done there.

Well, it is just that I found somewhere I can do things quite
quickly (and, hopefully, well enough ;-) )

I am currently investigating on a strange behaviour around the
shm (in my case, gpsd won't write past the first two NMEA messages)
And fell on this, that's (almost) all.

Two independent responses:

  I have the impression that gpsd supports the interfaces that ntpd
  offers for conveying time.

  You asked &quot;why isn't it different&quot;, but you didn't explain why you
  thought some other way would be better.
