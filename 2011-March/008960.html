&gt;<i> &gt; Why won't a semaphore be enough?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I assume this is a broadcast mechanism - gpsd writes, any number of
</I>&gt;<i> clients read.
</I>
Correct. And yes, this is a reaction to you talking about a shared-memory
interface in 
 
&gt;<i> Also, is the data going to be NOFLOAT?  The internal structures are
</I>&gt;<i> one thing but if you are going to do a shared memory segment, it will
</I>&gt;<i> have to be one or the other.
</I>
That will depend on whether you build client and daemon with NOFLOAT or not.
The transport part of the interface (shm and semaphore) won't care what's
in the struct, only the writers and readers will.

&gt;<i> Semaphores are the most obvious mechanism but it starts to defeat the
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity of using a SHM.  You need both the readers and writers to
</I>&gt;<i> use the semaphore, and you have to do it so readers won't block the
</I>&gt;<i> writer nor each other, at least not for very long, and that gets
</I>&gt;<i> tricky.  Linux's RCU mechanism doesn't have a user analog I've found.
</I>
I'm open to a better way to do it, but I haven't thought of a simpler 
method than shared-memory segment plus semaphore.

&gt;<i> The way I did it for the Nokia tablets (so my instrument cluster could
</I>&gt;<i> pick out speed, direction, etc whenever without blicking) is to use
</I>&gt;<i> the 32 bit integers for everything so reads were atomic, and use a
</I>&gt;<i> memory mapped file (mmap.h).  I did it with an actual file in /tmp,
</I>&gt;<i> but it should be just as doable with a file descriptor from a named
</I>&gt;<i> shm from shm_open.
</I>
This guarantees that a single read of any field will get a correct
value for some timestamp, but not that your entire multiple-field copy
of a fix representation is associated with the same timestamp.  That
does not seem good enough to me, not for potentially life-critical nav
systems.

&gt;<i> I would do an lseek to 0 then a write of the entire structure in the
</I>&gt;<i> daemon - this would update the mapped page atomically since it was
</I>&gt;<i> smaller than a page or sector (multicore might be a problem, but the
</I>&gt;<i> shm usage was noncritical).  The readers would have the file mmaped to
</I>&gt;<i> a local structure (python made this really easy).  On a processor with
</I>&gt;<i> native floating point (so it reads the float or double atomically) you
</I>&gt;<i> could use those instead of the 32 bit integers.
</I>
That synchronization seems dodgy to me (see above). OTOH, I like the idea 
of mmaping direct to the user structure for a zero-copy implementation.
Maybe that's a better path than shm.

&gt;<i> (quick explanation - I could do userland memcpy to the memory segment,
</I>&gt;<i> but that is interruptable whereas the internal memcpy in the OS write
</I>&gt;<i> won't be, at least not in a way that will leave it partially written
</I>&gt;<i> for a reader).
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> There can still be problems since it is volatile, but the routines
</I>&gt;<i> would need to check if anything changes, e.g. number of satellites.
</I>&gt;<i> Conversely, the readers could also do the lseek and read() and get the
</I>&gt;<i> data atomically.
</I>
Still sounds like a semaphore would be a safer way of interlocking. The
upper limit on read-write atomicity is not portable AFAIK.

Maybe we could avoid reader contention with a simple backoff algorithm?
