It's probably better than 100 mSec (if you're just looking at the
asynchronous-serial stream) - I'd believe a millisecond or
three.

On modern systems (with modern UARTs) the inner limit to handling
the serial packets is probably that of the UART's receive buffer.
By design, these UARTs usually don't generate an interrupt the
moment the first character arrives... they'll queue characters
up until the buffer has several bytes in it, or until some amount
of time has elapsed since the first such character (4 character
times by default in the 16550D).

At 4800 baud, this architecture could result in a delay of
up to a couple of milliseconds in the processing of inbound
packets, and the end-of-packet latency could shift unpredictably
from one packet to the next.

Systems which feed the PPS signal from the GPS to the DSR
or CD or CTS input to the PC's UART wouldn't suffer from this
UART delay... you'd be limited by IRQ overhead and latency.
There are tweaks available to the Linux kernel (and other
kernels) to do high-resolution PPS time capture based on this
IRQ, and I'd imagine that getting the slop down to 100 uSec
ought to be possible.

For the PPS signal itself... you can see some data on this
by looking at the results being plotted from my GPS-stabilized
10 MHz frequency standard (a VE2ZAZ design) at

  <A HREF="http://snulbug.mtview.ca.us/dave/fll.png">http://snulbug.mtview.ca.us/dave/fll.png</A>

The green data on the graph is the most relevant.  The
frequency-standard tracker is measuring the number of
100-nanosecond counts (from the 10 MHz oscillator) over
each 16-second period (with the periods being delimited
by the PPS signals from a Motorola Oncore UT+ GPS module).
The green dots show the difference between the measured count,
and 160,000,000.  If everything were perfect you'd see
green lines at +1, 0, and -1, and nowhere else.

Part of the added &quot;slop&quot; is due to the controller's PIC
micro clocking, part of it is drift and noise in the 10 MHz
oscillator, and part of it is GPS PPS timing slop.  The
controller averages out these error counts over a fairly
long period (currently 30 minutes) before deciding whether to
trim the 10 MHz oscillator speed upwards or downwards, and by
how much (the control voltage is shown as the red trace).

I can clearly see correlations between the control voltage,
and the temperature in my garage, and I was even able to see
a change in the weather last year.   I plan to build a secondary
temperature controller and make this device into a &quot;double oven&quot;
design.

Occasionally, the slop/error/noise exceeds a safety limit,
and the controller reports a &quot;holdover&quot; event (i.e. the state
of the frequency lock is uncertain).  The blue line at the top
shows the lock status... it's mostly locked, but you can see a
few blue dots just below the line which are 16-second periods
during which the lock state was questionable.  If it had
remained in &quot;holdover&quot; state for more than a couple of minutes,
the controller would have reported &quot;lock lost&quot; and turned off
the 10 MHz signal.

There are a very few points in the graph where the accumulated
timing slop over 16 seconds rose as high as 600 nSec, but it was
usually less than that.  An error-analysis graph I ran a few
months ago showed that 90% or more of the 16-second intervals
had a timing slop of 300 nSec or less.

I suspect that the timing slop would be reduced if I put up
a better GPS antenna... I'm currently using a small patch
antenna, indoors, under a wood-and-asphalt roof.  I stuck a
better antenna outdoors a while ago (a Trimble &quot;bullet&quot; type)
and the GPS display seemed to be indicating quite a bit of
improvement in the SNR... this might let the GPS track more
satellites accurately and reduce the impact of noise on the
timing determinations.

The Oncore UT+ has its TIME RAIM feature enabled, and
so it'll stop sending PPS (and thus force a holdover) if
its internal sanity checks conclude that its PPS accuracy
has degraded below about 500 nSec.  I suspect (but am not
certain) that this was what triggered many of the holdover
events shown in the graph... too few satellites in clear view
of my wimpy antenna resulted in too much timing slop.
