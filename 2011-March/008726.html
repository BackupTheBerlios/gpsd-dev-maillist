<PRE>This is a consolidated reply to your five postings around the topic of
stripping down gpsd to a minimalist, NMEA-only version using no
floating point and suitable for low-power embedded development.

Summary: it seems to me to break down into two tasks.

(1) De-autoconfiscating the build system

(2) Cleaning floating point usage out of the core structures and NMEA driver.

The first task is relatively easy, and should come first.  The second will
be messy and difficult.  This is not going to happen before we ship the
2.96 release.

One major question I have for you is: could you live with scons as a
build system? That would be a relatively easy transition.

Answers to your more specific questions and comments:

&gt;<i>First, I didn't know until your message it would be possible to build
</I>&gt;<i>such a version.
</I>
Yes, all you have to do is configure out all drivers except NMEA.  Most of
the code goes away if a raft of stuff like binary-GPS drivers and support
for RTCM2 and RTCM3 and AIS are configured out.

&gt;<i>I might try, but I know I don't have anything to do libtool for MIPS.
</I>
This falls under &quot;getting rid of autotools&quot;.  Autotools is full of 
horrible botches; libtool is one of the worst.  Shooting it through
the head would be a positive pleasure.

&gt;<i>There are a bunch of options to disable things and I'm not sure which
</I>&gt;<i>are features and which are protocols.  there is no --minimalist
</I>&gt;<i>option, and there is nothing that I can find describing how I would
</I>&gt;<i>build what you are specifically talking about.
</I>
Look at this listing from the end of configure:

It should tell you what you need to know.  The place you probably want to 
start is by turning off all protocols other than NMEA and the NTP support.

&gt;<i>I am more efficient because I have highly optimized parser code.  The
</I>&gt;<i>NMEA output is a short string of integer characters  Everything else
</I>&gt;<i>has a very short path..
</I>
I don't quite inderstand this.  What &quot;NMEA output&quot; is a short string of
integers?  NMEA sentences generally at least have an alphabetic tag.

&gt;<i>for minigpsd, I was using shared memory, so I could just open and
</I>&gt;<i>overlay the section and updates would be instantaneous - and no
</I>&gt;<i>message passing or repackaging.
</I>
I don't understand this, either.  Was it your method of communicating
to clients?

&gt;<i>Even in the makefile, I had CFLAGS += `pkgconfig...&quot; for gconf instead
</I>&gt;<i>of the autogen stuff, and maemo uses debian packaging.
</I>
We might end up using something like your pkgconfig trick.  But it would
be far easier to transion off autotools if you could use scons as your
build system. 

&gt;<i>No, right at the top of driver_nmea.c where it picks out the lat/lon:
</I>
You are right.  There is much more float dependency in the code than I
understood.  We'll have to deal with this, and it's going to be a lot
of work.  But I've taken some first steps.

&gt;<i>It would be intertesting to compare ncycles 
</I>
How would you recommend we do this?

&gt;<i>                                             I keep everyting in
</I>&gt;<i>micro-degrees (could go to tenth-of if any hardware was that
</I>&gt;<i>accurate). 
</I>
Diego Berge had some thoughts about this which I'll get to later in this reply.

&gt;<i>As I've shown, you are using libraries and floats everywhere.  We're
</I>&gt;<i>talking extreme liposuction.
</I>
Yes.  But it's the right thing to do.  We'll just have to take it in steps.

&gt;<i>Most distros probably just use the defaults or nearso.
</I>
I think the OpenMoko build is NMEA-only.

&gt;<i>The other half is I can't use gpsd-ng since I can't (and probably will
</I>&gt;<i> never be able to) inline external data.  You will have water depth or
</I>&gt;<i>whatever merged into the info stream, but I can't merge my engine rpm
</I>&gt;<i>and fuel consumption data.  I have other sensors, some might get
</I>&gt;<i>adopted, others not.  I need multiple redundant failover GPSes but one
</I>&gt;<i>master value.
</I>
We merge water depth and so forth only if those drivers are enabled.
If you strip down to NMEA support only you'll get TPV and SKY and
that's about it.

&gt;<i>Also, even if I did - and I might take a look with your help and
</I>&gt;<i>comments - I don't see the necessary features being in gpsd-ng, so I
</I>&gt;<i>have to write my version anyway.
</I>
What features do you need that we don't have?

&gt;<i>As a postscript, looking at gps.h, &quot;double&quot; is everywhere.  I'm in
</I>&gt;<i>microdegrees (could go to 100 nanodegrees).  Even time portion of an
</I>&gt;<i>hour is double.
</I>
Problem acknowledged.

&gt;<i>I am really willing to help do a nofloat version, but then would
</I>&gt;<i>anything still work?
</I>
Here is my thought about how to get there.

1. Introduce a NOFLOAT conditional.  Outside it, do what we do now.
Inside it, various structure members change type.  Timestamps become
milliseconds rather than seconds with a fractional part.  Degrees become
microdegrees or something like that.

2. Currently in JSON reporting, some types of obects (notably AIS
sentences) may be reported in either scaled or unscaled format. 
(You tell the difference by a &quot;scaled&quot; attribute.)  Currently
TPVs are always reported in a scaled form.  Undeer NOFLOAT we 
report them unscaled. 

&gt;<i>The original target MIPS and the lower-end ARM processors don't have
</I>&gt;<i>an FPU, and most FPUs aren't single cycle.
</I>
Right.  Which is why at the *next* major API break forced on us for
whatever other reason, NOFLOAT goes away and we're all fixed-point all
the time.

&gt;<i>That said, the web interface and the rest should be fairly agnostic or
</I>&gt;<i>easily modified.
</I>
Indeed. I would welcome that.

In your third post, you give this list of requirements:

&gt;<i>What I need from a gpsd to work in embedded:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. No floating point or other big libraries.  This might or might not
</I>&gt;<i>mean NMEA only, but from the binary formats I've seen it isn't that
</I>&gt;<i>hard to do fixed point parsing.
</I>
I think, at least at first, it will be acceptable to support NMEA only
in NOFLOAT.  We'll get some others for free; the AIS driver, for example 
is already integer-clean with no floats or doubles.

&gt;<i>2. I need to be able to type &quot;make -f Makefile.gpsdmini&quot; instead of
</I>&gt;<i>requiring the entire GNU autobuild environment.  Even if the binary is
</I>&gt;<i>a bit chubby (I suggested drivers as plugins earlier) memory is rarely
</I>&gt;<i>a limit and you can -DNMEA_ONLY if it comes to that.  Nothing but -lc,
</I>&gt;<i>i.e. the implicit link path, or maybe one or two if they are cross
</I>&gt;<i>system and really needed, but I can't think of any.  No libtool,
</I>&gt;<i>automake, autoconf, or the rest should be necessary for gpsd itself.
</I>&gt;<i>I could do this too once I see how to do a minimalist
</I>&gt;<i>makefile/config.h.
</I>
We agree on getting rid of autotools.  But do you really need a
flat makefile or can you use scons?

&gt;<i>3. An API for interleaving events or other sensor data.  I can have
</I>&gt;<i>another interface picking up other data, but if the line of text comes
</I>&gt;<i>in before the GPS line of text, it needs to go out, send the event, or
</I>&gt;<i>otherwise coordinate with it.  For example, my dashboard app needs
</I>&gt;<i>engine RPM.  I could pull everything separately and merge it but each
</I>&gt;<i>app would have to do that.  Maybe a driver_xeno.c that just opens a
</I>&gt;<i>listen/read socket and provides text strings out the JSON if a watch
</I>&gt;<i>is set.  I don't need much, but I do need a way to merge and sync
</I>&gt;<i>data.  (I'm assuming the multiple source GPS and failover is already
</I>&gt;<i>there).  If this is decided, it might clear up trouble on whether to
</I>&gt;<i>include some of the other data GPS devices provide which aren't nav
</I>&gt;<i>data like water temp.  Anything not in the main nav structure becomes
</I>&gt;<i>available through a standard catch-all method.
</I>
The data interleaving won't be difficult.  And yes, multiple source
GPS and failover is already there.

&gt;<i>And yes, I would prefer to get gpsd-ng down to embedded size rather
</I>&gt;<i>than doing a separate codebase.
</I>
Better for all involved, yes.

&gt;<i>One of the requirements that make it possible is that data obtained
</I>&gt;<i>through gpsd must not suffer significant loss of precision.
</I>
Agreed. I think we're pretty much there for consumer-grade hardware.
tz's microdegrees is enough for that.

&gt;<i>Now, while there appear to be very valid and worthwhile reasons that
</I>&gt;<i>would make it desirable for gpsd to work exclusively at the integer
</I>&gt;<i>level, as discussed on this insightful thread, I suggest that in order
</I>&gt;<i>to preserve precision at the level at which current and near-term
</I>&gt;<i>future geomatics products work, data representation in the order of
</I>&gt;<i>10^9 sexagesimal degrees would be required (that's around 1/10th of a
</I>&gt;<i>millimetre of a great circle).  Unfortunately that level of
</I>&gt;<i>granularity cannot be had with 32 bit integers, so 64 bit storage is
</I>&gt;<i>the minimum (2^32 &lt; 360/10^-9 &lt; 2^64).
</I>
Crash landing.  We may get there someday, but in the near-term future
the goal of supporting embedded means we *can't* work only on 64-bit.

So here's what we'll do.  Angular measurement under NOFLOAT will get
its own integer type, angle_t or something.  We'll set the units 
at microdegrees with a future direction that they may change to
nanodegrees in a future major API revision.  We'll do code-hygiene
things, like having a scale constant rather than magic numbers, to
make that easy.

&gt;<i>P.S.: Back in 2005, I recall there was a similar issue with the
</I>&gt;<i>output precision of lat/lon values, but that was only a matter of
</I>&gt;<i>changing the printf() spec, an easy patch to apply (which I did).
</I>
And much appreciated.  You do good work, Diego; I wish you were more 
active here.
