</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway. I don't think this is critical at all. NTRIP did not work at all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before this, so I don't think there are any users. The main use case of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one GPS receiver and one RTCM/DGPS source is fully supported as soon as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we sort the last bug out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right.  We can worry about the rare case later.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No. A reference station sends correction data for particular satellites.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The correction data depend on position of the station and some other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> factors (weather ...).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you get correction data from two different reference stations, they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are most definitely different for the same satellite. So they conflict
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with each other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But can't this happen even if you have only a single RTCM source?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A single RTCM2 source sends you what is in effect a stream of corrections
</I>&gt;<i> tagged by reference station ID and satellite PRN (or at least that is how
</I>&gt;<i> I undertstand the Type 1 and Type 9 messages).  The RTCM interpreter in
</I>&gt;<i> the GPS must have some way to resolve this &quot;conflict&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now we move up to multiple RTCM sources.  The aggregate of these is
</I>&gt;<i> still just a a stream of corrections tagged by reference station ID
</I>&gt;<i> and satellite PRN.
</I>
I don't see the tag part in the rtcm messages (struct rtcm2_msg1 in
driver_rtcm2.h), that carry the correction data. Correct me if I am
wrong here. But I can't find tagging info in the rtcm2 spec either.
Anyway, the caster should take care of the consistency of the data it
sends out.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why this is more difficult to handle, unless you're
</I>&gt;<i> telling me that a single RTCM source never ships corrections for more
</I>&gt;<i> than one reference station.
</I>
Well, yes. At least one mountpoint on a caster is sending out correction
data for exactly one reference station. It may change this station, when
another one is nearer to the client and available to the caster, but it
never mixes them.

Thats the whole point here. You take the nearest reference station to
you, which then gives you correctional data for the position it is at.
You can use this data, knowing that the correctional data should apply
quite nicely to your position as well, because the reference station is
not that far away from you.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The reason I need to know this is that I plan on feature-freezing for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the release as soon as you tell me the Ntrip support is in good shape.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As if I haven't got enough pressure already :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry.  You just happen to be at the top of the bugs-to-be-fixed list
</I>&gt;<i> this time around.  One would think you'd be happy with that position
</I>&gt;<i> of priority :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really, really happy that we have a live Ntrip user who knows what
</I>&gt;<i> he's doing.  The dusty state of that code had been bothering me for
</I>&gt;<i> literally *years*.
