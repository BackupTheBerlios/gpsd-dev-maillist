&gt;<i> Excuse a stupid question, but how closely are you trying to synchronize.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are using a 1Hz GPS, without the pps, given the variable
</I>&gt;<i> latency in GPSD and hardware, the value will be close, but sometime
</I>&gt;<i> after the second boundary.
</I>
Gary or Chris will have to answer this.  I don't understand the NTP
interface that well.
 
&gt;<i> For readers, you could just do successive reads every 100 milliseconds
</I>&gt;<i> or even 10 milliseconds (if the cache takes longer than this there are
</I>&gt;<i> far worse problems) and find a set equal - without counters or
</I>&gt;<i> anything.  Just memcmp.
</I>
Sorry, I didn't understand this.

&gt;<i> Even if it is only a few times per second, what performance benefits
</I>&gt;<i> will be gained by using shm instead of a shared file
</I>&gt;<i> (write(fd,buf,sizeof(buf)); fsync())?  Especially if you start adding
</I>&gt;<i> semaphores.
</I>
shm has two features of note:

(1) We're already depending on it in the NTPSHM case.

(2) I had written shm code before. I hadn't written shared-file code before
    That made shm the path of lesser effort.

Note that the shmness of the transport is pretty well isolated in two
small modules.  If we wanted to change it, that wouldn't be difficult.
 
&gt;<i> But do you need 10mS or 1mS accuracy?
</I>
It's not so much a question of what *we* need as of what GPSD's end users
need.  I think they'd appreciate as much accuracy as they can get.
