<PRE>I should ask this, and this might be a good place.

There are time-only devices.  I have an inexpensive WWVB receiver that
does a pulse-per-second synced with the atomic clock and returns time
only, but very accurate, especially if you compensate for the distance
from the transmitter (which need not be down to the meter).  This is
not a GPS but is a precise timing device, returns the exact UTC time
after one minute with a good signal, and has a per-second edge.

Ror PPS to sync the system clock, the edge needs to be
captured/compared with the system time, or otherwise correlated so
that the second tick of the system can occur precisely when the edge
does.  NTP has this for samples with PLL like code.  But some of the
hardware driver seems to be in gpsd.  However to do things properly it
really needs to be a kernel driver since you need to see things right
after an interrupt, near zero latency and jitter.

My problem with what is trying to be done with gpsd and PPS and ntp
and timing is they might be related or overlapping, but doing precise
PPS synchronization - or for that matter any time synchronization is a
different function.  Maybe for a ppsd designed for the deeper hardware
problems (which could use gpsd itself as a source for the timestamps
or its infrastructure).
