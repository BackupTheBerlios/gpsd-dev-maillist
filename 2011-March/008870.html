The reason is proper testing. I'm more or less sure that all of the last
releases either missed files or had some other nasty bugs. Due to a lot of
changes during the last weeks a proper testing is *not* possible imho.
I'd suggest to create a stable branch, keep that for testing and release it
after some time if nobody complains. And also ship point-releases from that
branch. Having only major releases with a lot of changes is a major PITA for
everybody who wants to ship a bugfree gpsd in a distribution. I think the gpsd
package in Debian Squeeze comes with about 10 patches from the master branch and
I'm up to 13 now in unstable. And there is no way that the next release will go
into unstable soon due to a lot of changes and a library transition.
I don't know about the other distributions but I'm kinda sure that none of them
takes as much care of their gpsd package as I do in Debian, and for me it is a
PITA most of the time. And so it seems to be for you for no real reason.
Branching is cheap and fun in git, I fail to understand why it is not done for
such a project. There are various other projects from smaller ones with more or
less one developer like merkaartor up to the linux kernel with a ton of
developers where using a branch (and topic branches for largish changes) works
very well.I think that is something the gpsd prject can learn from.
