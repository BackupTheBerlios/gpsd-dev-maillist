Both-and, not either or.  For all the larger systems and variants,
autoconf is currently the only alternative, but it still could be
cleaned up quite a bit.

However, for embedded, many won't use libgpsd - they will just connect
to the ports and set watches or directly inquire.  Firefox doesn't
link with libgpsd, and you can consider an external device sitting on
the dashboard which just runs gpsd, and anything else is handled on
another device.

A large amount of the build stuff is for the rest of the system
outside of the daemon.

&gt;<i> It's one thing to talk about throwing out autoconf, but you haven't been
</I>&gt;<i> specific about what set of environments the resulting code would run in,
</I>&gt;<i> and how you will handle the various issues that
</I>&gt;<i> autoconf/automake/libtool were designed to handle.

Totally minimal would be something like an Arduino with net shield.
Mine comes close to fitting one, but I haven't pushed it that far and
it is 8 bit with 16 bit integers in C.  But there are some very small
fully embedded ARM boards with tiny RTOS but with network connections.

Practical base: Small ARM/Linux boards like openmoko, chumby,
beagleboard.  Jailbroken iOS.  Gumstix (especially with the onboard
bluetooth).

I should be able to adjust the top 10 lines in a side makefile with
config data, type make and point it at that file (which would be
separate from the autogen stuff), and generate a binary for gpsd.

The only requirement for mine is (g)libc, and even then only the
fairly vanilla string.h, stdio.h, and socket calls.  Termios if you
want to do that inside.  That is all you should need for the daemon
(at least in a minimalist mode).  System wise, 32 bit integers or
change to int_32 declarations - though looking at the code I don't
think even for all the autogen stuff it would fail to work if int is
not 32 bit (and might not work completely right if int is 64 bit).

The only thing I do in mine is use some sed type stuff to take the web
page templates (which are in HTML) and change them to one big included
string, escaping all the quotes and stuff.  The rest is mostly the
implicit rules.
