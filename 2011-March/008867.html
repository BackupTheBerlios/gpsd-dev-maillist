</I>
Currently there are only four data objects.  I don't see this
increasing.  Adding an all/tpv/sky...etc on/off control and doing it
per-device shouldn't be that hard.  I'm not saying the content should
be ala carte, but which messages.  You are already ala carte with
respect to json v.s. pseudo-nmea v.s. raw.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Add a debug or log or something to the watch if RAW
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't suffice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Implementation already queued for after 2.96; the class is LOGMESSAGE.
</I>&gt;<i> I borrowed Guido's time machine. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe have a combined TPV/SKY such that TPV might include SKY if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No. &#160;Orthogonality violation; also, TPV and SKY are typically emitted at
</I>&gt;<i> different intervals. The POLL response gets away with this only because its
</I>&gt;<i> semantics are &quot;show me what you have&quot;.
</I>
So if one of the binary protocols or a new one emitted parts of any of
the existing data objects at different intervals then we should split
them up?

&gt;&gt;<i> Add a simple json watch response for stuff like browsers or such with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just time/lat/lon/(alt)/speed/track - maybe this can be TPV. &#160;This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should also be something returnable by xhttpdrequest and easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processed by browser javascript.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See above on a la carte. &#160;If you want this, prove that it's necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> My standard for proof will be strict.
</I>
OK, I agree that there should b e just one TPV data object.  So I
would have to make an xhttpdrequest for TPV and I would get back a TPV
identical to what is formatted if WATCH is enabled or within a POLL.
Same for SKY.

&gt;&gt;<i> I can't comment on the other WATCH responses, at least not yet, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those should also be cleaned up as necessary. &#160;There should be one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JSON message format for each kind of data. &#160;If something is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> duplicated, we should split or combine the messages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's already designed this way. &#160;If you think you've identified
</I>&gt;<i> non-orthogonality or duplication, report it as a bug.
</I>
Note to self - check/audit the data objects.

&gt;&gt;<i> For multiple devices, allow/select a &quot;best&quot; device based on fix (3d
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over 2d), and DOP. &#160;I have some code in mine for this which I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adapt. &#160;Currently gpsd allows for redundancy but clients would then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to figure out which one is degraded or not tracking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For whether something should be inside or outside, one consideration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is if multiple clients would end up doing the same calculation most of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time. &#160;Do I really want firefox to have to pick out which GPS were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even valid or best?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, this is worth discussing. &#160;Is there any reason we shouldn't handle
</I>&gt;<i> this by adding a rank attribute composed from mode and DOP? &#160;Then an
</I>&gt;<i> application that just wants &quot;best&quot; could just pick the fix with rank 1.
</I>
It is a little more subtle - there needs to be a bit of hysteresis and
the first two might be equally good, but you would want number 1 to be
sticky so you don't oscillate since the fixes will tend to have
persistent differences.

&gt;&gt;<i> If we are going to include DoP calculations, XYZ might be good, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elliptical axes might be better. &#160;My apartment faces SE so I usually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get an arc in that direction. &#160;X and Y are likely to be about equal,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but SW-NE and SE-NW are likely to be very different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe, but I don't know how to get elliptical axes from the skyview
</I>&gt;<i> covariance matrix. &#160;You'd have to show me the math before I'd consider
</I>&gt;<i> this one seriously.
</I>
I will have to do a little searching.  I know one of the GPS units I
have or were considering had this as part of some binary output.

&gt;&gt;<i> We can leave the decimal points in for NOFLOAT - All I'm doing is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %d.%06d for output which is still probably much faster than %f. &#160;(I do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar for speed, track, pdop, but in milli-units).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we do &quot;NOFLOAT&quot; this way - is there a reason to keep FLOAT around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after it is complete? &#160;It should be transparent except for the far
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fewer CPU cycles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was assuming FLOAT would go away eventually. &#160;You've already won this
</I>&gt;<i> one, provided you follow through with code.
</I>
As soon as the 3.0 branch is set up I can get started.  It won't be
too quick and there will be a big crunch when we replace the instances
of double in the fix structure.

&gt;&gt;<i> POLL should return the same thing WATCH does, maybe with one more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> layer of class encapsulation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This didn't make any sense. &#160;WATCH just sets reporting policy; POLL
</I>&gt;<i> returns fix data. &#160;I can't imagine how confusing the two could be
</I>&gt;<i> useful.
</I>
I am a bit off in this since it does return TPV and SKY objects (but
why not the others?). - see below

&gt;&gt;<i> The return size for poll will need to be much larger. &#160;TPV + SKY for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ONE GPS is over 900 characters. &#160;I think even the existing format
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which only has a few less characters and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;&quot;{&quot;PRN&quot;:19,&quot;el&quot;:39,&quot;az&quot;:163,&quot;ss&quot;:37,&quot;used&quot;:true},&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;is 49 characters, so can be around 700 per GPS (12 in view plus two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WAAS). &#160;Three or more will overflow the 1536 limit. unless we do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like BEGIN / DEVICE 1 WATCH JSON / DEVICE 2 WATCH JSON... /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> END. with a guarantee that even if WATCH is active or DEVICE changes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it won't interrupt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're probably right. &#160;The only reason the max response size is so small
</I>&gt;<i> is that I didn't want to impose huge buffers on embedded deployments.
</I>&gt;<i> You are an embedded deployment; what size do you think would be reasonable.
</I>
I would just expand the maximum size of any message to 4096 - we
probably won't go near it, but I can imagine this being used to test
an array of devices.  I can't come up with a limit because this is
defined to be monolithic.

That is why I'm suggesting replacing the current method with just
returning each of the data objects available - also sorted per device
(the current one has tpv1 tpv2 tpv3 sky1 sky2 sky3, I would do tpv1
sky1 tpv2 sky2...).

You might encapsulate it in a poll-with response number class or
something, but as I suggested:
POLL DATA OBJECT BEGIN
TPV for device 1 (should be identical to the last one emitted by a WATCH)
SKY1 (device can be by rank or arbitrary order - but rank will then
have to go somewhere).
(others)1
TPV2
SKY2
(others)2
POLL DATA OBJECT END

I would not perfer this, but it could be encapsulated in a
{class:&quot;poll&quot;,serno:&quot;1234&quot;, {class:&quot;TPV... to keep things straight,
but begin/end should be sufficient.

There would be no arbitrary limits on the data buffer size.

With a guarantee that no notifications would occur within the poll output.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think all the pieces are there, but they could be arranged more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conveniently for a client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, pieces of what?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Suggestion, and I don't know if this is practical or useful in your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> context but it is in mine - add an optional millisecond &quot;systime&quot; -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time field is what comes from the messages, but systime would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> track the arrival time of the raw messages. &#160;Maybe raw only, but you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might get some measure of latency and if there are multiple interfaces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or sensors it would give a finer and consistent resolution than the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GPS timestamp. &#160;I would expect it to be offset, but would help measure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the latency, e.g. 43050 - $GPRMC ...43.000.... &#160;So you could more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily match actual position at higher rates with different sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand your use case. &#160;How would this help you, exactly?
</I>
See baud below for an example, though it is debugging, but if I am
trying to correlate or sort data that might not be coming from GPSD.
A different program might not be able to use the GPS clock, and might
be coming in with more or less latency.  If I want to playback the
data stream - in this case with or without external data, I would have
to play it back when gpsd saw it (more or less), not when the
timestamp in the GPS data says.  If you are feeding via a filesystem
or pipe you will get a bunch of messages in under a millisecond if you
don't pace it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Note that higher baud rates would help to reduce latency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not by as much as you think. &#160;I profiled this; it turns out that for
</I>&gt;<i> a typical NMEA device, 4800bs is a bit too slow, 9600 suffices, and
</I>&gt;<i> more than that is overkill. &#160;White paper, with numbers and profile graphs,
</I>&gt;<i> is on the website.
</I>
To clarify, &quot;maximum baud rate possible&quot;.  115200 is usually used to
upload AGPS, so most newer GPS chips support that or even higher.

9600 baud is just over a millisecond per byte, so a 64 byte sentence
will take about 65 milliseconds to get through before you can start
processing it.  If you need the last in a set, it might come in to
trip the output at 200mS or longer.

115200 baud is around 96 microseconds per byte, so would be under 7
milliseconds when the full sentence was in, 30-40 milliseconds for the
last in the set if that.

Even at 1Hz (where the mS timestamps helped) it tends to emit all the
sentences in 50mS - 1/20th of a second or less.

There would be little difference in latency from the sentence
transmission to the WATCH notification in this case?

Off the main thread, I don't know if I mentioned DIY drones has a new
GPS (with their own binary protocol that uses 32 bit microdegree
entries):
