Hi there,

   That's not quite right, at least not for non-consumer grade devices.
Corrections from multiple sources are a requirement for redundancy and
QC purposes in industrial applications, and so is the use of multiple
stations, from which a combined set of corrections is formed and applied.

   That on the other hand is correct. You normally want to ensure that
there are no ID conflicts (different stations with the same ID or same
stations with different ID), although that can sometimes be handled
further downstream.

Diego Berge.
