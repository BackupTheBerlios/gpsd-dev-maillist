Please accept my apology, I didn't study the gpsd code and am
obviously not familiar with it.  I made an assumption I shouldn't have
in conflating the two.

</I>
Thanks for mentioning splint, I was unaware of it.  Had I known about
it during our year-long static analysis gap I probably would have used
it.  <A HREF="http://www.splint.org/">http://www.splint.org/</A> for the record.

&gt;&gt;<i> You will find very few strcpy() or strcat() or sprintf() remaining in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potential buffer overruns.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quite right. I'm careful about this, and Chris Keuthe prods me when I slip.
</I>
I also was unaware of strlcpy().  Well, I'd seen it, but was unaware
it wasn't simply an alternate spelling of strncpy().  Sadly, I
repeated the OpenBSD mistake of converting a bunch of code from
strcpy()/strcat() to strncpy() and strncat() more than 10 years later
thanks to that ignorance, and will be converting to the
less-error-prone strlcpy()/strlcat() form now.  It wasn't a total
loss, in that I converted some strcpy()/strcat()/strcat() sequences to
snprintf which is clearer.

&gt;&gt;<i> Coverity did not produce any scans of ntpd for nearly a year ending
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this January, and I've never been told why, and had to discover myself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by logging into their site that they had finally picked up again,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where a simple email would have let me react to the issues more than a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> month sooner. &#160;Still, I appreciate every scrap of donated static
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analysis from them and others and I recognize they have paying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customers which take priority over their open source activities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't been able to get Coverity to respond to requests for a
</I>&gt;<i> rescan since 2007. &#160;What procedure did you use to successfully
</I>&gt;<i> wake them up?
</I>
First off I should note I was uniquely disadvantaged regarding not
seeing email about the scans.  Apparently when NTP first signed up
with Coverity, in addition to creating the coverity user IDs, a
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">ntp at scan.coverity.com</A> mailing list was established with all the
ntp.org folks having access to Coverity results included.  When I
joined the project a few years later, I was unaware of the list to
request addition, and it was overlooked by those who knew or had known
of it in the process of setting up my coverity user ID.  Around a day
ago I came across a reference to the list and asked David Maxwell to
add me to it, which he did about 12 hours ago, and his response hinted
that had I been subscribed the resumption of analysis would have been
known to me.

As far as getting service from Coverity Scan, it's been hit or miss to
say the least.  I believe it took several months and a half dozen
prods from myself and Harlan Stenn before David Maxwell reached far
enough down his apparently overflowing to-do list to set me up with
credentials.  That meant several months before there was any movement
to correct the most recent analysis, as none of the others maintaining
ntpd were looking at coverity during that time.

I already mentioned a year without analysis.  I begged and pleaded a
few times for a more recent scan (probably over a month or two) and
then decided it wasn't helping to harass and beg.  Who knows if more
emails might have helped.  And that was the third time I was put off
by lack of response from David.  The second time was when we were
moved from rung 1 to rung 2, for several months ntpd saw new coverity
scans intermittently weeks apart, rather than every few days.  I was
frustrated that I'd rather have regression coverage ongoing for rung 1
issues than have such sporadic scans at rung 2.

I don't envy David Maxwell's position.  Every time he pokes his head
up with some progress, he must be inundated with previously-ignored
requests for access or other assistance from the 200+ projects, as
well as new requests from people getting while the getting is good.
Persistence and patience, unsatisfying as it may be, is the only
wisdom I can offer.  I do think it's worth pursuing, though, as rung 2
did uncover latent bugs that rung 1 did not.

&gt;&gt;<i> In over 10 years of NTP4 releases, there have been 4 security hotfixes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issued [2].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've never had one. &#160;The last time we had a bug with known security
</I>&gt;<i> implications was in 2005, and I think that was our first.
</I>
Yes, I don't doubt the gpsd codebase is much cleaner than ntpd even
today.  One of the two buffer overrun hotfixes I mentioned was in
new-for-NTP4 code (autokey) but the other was inherited from the xntpd
code (NTP v3).  The most recent hotfix patch (for DoS not overrun)
applied cleanly to the oldest tarballs Harlan Stenn could scrape up,
predating his 15 years in the project and in all likelihood dating to
20+ years ago.  Dr. Mills has long focused on a few core pieces of the
distribution and, for the most part, relied on others to write and
maintain the bulk of the code.  Those others have often been grad
students and itch-scratchers who crank out code until it works for
them and leave it to others to worry about niceties like consistent
style, portability beyond the system(s) the contributor used, and
maintainability.  Harlan Stenn has done a commendable job over the
years of tackling many of these tasks, especially portability with the
switch to autotools from hideous #ifdef forests and hand-rolled
Makefiles.  Nonetheless, I've found no shortage of cases where I
started looking at code to add a feature or fix a bug and found myself
doing a lot of not-directly-needed cleanup &quot;while I'm there&quot;.  I have
a few items on my to-do list where I see things I want to clean up but
haven't dug in yet, now including strlcpy() and strlcat() use.

&gt;&gt;<i> If gpsd developers currently having access to Coverity Scan results do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not have time to investigate, please ask <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">dmaxwell at coverity.com</A> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grant userid davehart access to gpsd scan results.
</I>
I happened to read the Coverity Scan &quot;annual report&quot; for 2010 in the
last day.  It mentioned the upcoming change in 2010 from disclosing
defects exclusively to project maintainers towards a
responsible-disclosure-like approach meant to light a fire underneath
maintainers to re-engage with Coverity. Scan.  It was suggested
projects would be converted one at a time with 30-60 days notice to
allow any cleanup desired before the defect reports for that project
go public.  I'm looking forward to more eyes on our scan results,

Take care,
Dave Hart
