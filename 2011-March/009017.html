<PRE>Haste and wastage, mostly mine

Eric Raymond &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">esr at snark.thyrsus.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The case I'm addressing is one reader, one or more writers.
</I>
I think you mean one writer, multiple readers.

Also to clarify, writes always succeed, reads will run and have a
reliable error checking mechanism whereby they retry the read until no
error occurs.

If write copies the whole structure in reverse, with the last byte
being the end sentinel, and reads copy the whole structure forward
with the first byte being the start sentinel, then you can't have read
get the same value for both sentinels (barring wraparound) if an
intervening write occurs during any part of the copy.

u8 is likely to be atomic in all cases.

Write could technically set the end sentinel, edit the payload, then
set the start sentinel.

Read could actually save the start, pick bits from the payload, then
compare the end.

readvalid is the exclusive-Nor of the start and end.

&gt;<i> So you would need forememcpy and backmemcpy with or without the
</I>&gt;<i> previously suggested minimal inlinable function.
</I>
what I meant to say, is you need either your own versions guaranteed
to go in the direction you want or one guaranteed to go opposite to
the system memcpy for the writer, and it wouldn't matter if the
function was interruptable or inlined.
