<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I think the latency figures you are showing are from your &quot;wait for
</I>&gt;<i> the whole set then emit the fix&quot; algorithm.  It is counting to the
</I>&gt;<i> GPRMC sentence almost a second at either baud rate.
</I>
Except I didn't figure out how to do cycle recognition until a couple
years after I did the profiling. Back then we had a J command to switch
between two reporting modes. One was without jitter smoothing, in which
the equivalent of TPVs were sent on every sentence that reported a (partial) 
fix.  With jitter-smooting enabled fix data was just cumulated.

So your analysis is clever but that assumption is (though quite
reasonable on the information you have) incorrect.

&gt;<i> Since I don't have the other details, I can't duplicate the results,
</I>&gt;<i> but you could try one of the newer GPS units that go from 4800 to
</I>&gt;<i> 115200 baud and repeat the test.  If there is still nearly one second
</I>&gt;<i> of latency at 115200 (or if it gets worse the higher you go since the
</I>&gt;<i> inter-fix pause will get longer) either the aggregation algorithm is
</I>&gt;<i> broken or the profiling method.
</I>
I can no longer duplicate that exact set of results, because the
profiling method changed when the protocol did. There's now a TIMING
object; it's deliberately undocumented, but searching for TIMING and
reading the surrounding code in gpsd.c would tell you what you need to
know.

Repeating the profiling tests with the new machinery has been a
low-priority item on my list for some years now.  If you want to take
it on, read the documentation and code for gpsprof. It was written to
produce various interesting reports from the raw timing data.
