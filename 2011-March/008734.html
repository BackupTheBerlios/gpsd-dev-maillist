This whole thing is for the next major release, as Eric mentioned

Assuming anyone really understands the hairy bits of the existing system.
It sounds like adding a --minimalist and/or --nolib option and not
requiring libtool is a lot of work.  Autotools is one big hairy bit so
even is the system is a completely standard linux/macosx, with
everything in the standard places, using glibc, it still takes forever
to go through autogen and configure - it has to verify string.h is
there for some reason.  I don't think it would work with bsd cc and
those tools - anything other than gcc, but that was one of the reasons
for having all the options in the first place so you you could build
on a Sparc workstation, VAX, or other things.  I've noted earlier that
gpsd-ng is one of the few that is actually to cross-compile - earlier,
Ubuntu ended up getting an array of ARM processors to do native
compiles because it was far easier to do that than to fix all the
problems.  I don't know how Gentoo or Debian do it, but I suspect it
is not using QEMU

Note - QEMU might be an interesting way to profile gpsd-ng v.s.
webgpsd - I don't know what it has internally, but we might be able to
insert a CPU cycle counter.

What seems to have happened is it that there are now a lot of hard
dependencies on GCC and GLIBC (or for embedded, and equivalent of that
and not the older libcs), but the liturgy and rituals of checking for
things and setting up the Makefiles is still done.  Perhaps they
should be rewritten in Latin.  Not just this project, but nearly
everything between the Gnome desktop and the kernel.

Has anyone actually tried moving the toolchain or libraries into
something like /opt and see if autogen.sh still works?  Using cc or
another toolchain instead of gcc?  Is any of this part of your
regression test?

Even if scons needs to add some extra stuff for particular platforms
the hairy bits will be a wig that won't be used or cause problems on
the default standard linux distro installs.  The 5-sigma cases can add
their stuff where needed, but the 2 sigma cases should be a lot
lighter and faster.  Right now it probably generates identical
makefiles for 99% of the linux systems, and config.h differs only if
there are #define options.
