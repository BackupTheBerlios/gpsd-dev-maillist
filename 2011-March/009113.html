That would indeed work, but it is an OS call, it could just as well be a 
semaphore call.

My 4-wide buffer is neither  complex nor a lot of overhead:

The total cost is specifically a total of 2 or 3 clock cycles, to mask 
the counter value and to generate the desired buffer offset which 
requires a mul-by-24 which is handled with a shift&amp;add on many 
architectures, and a single LEA to multiply by 3 on x86, whereupon the 
individual members can be loaded with a scaled-by-8 indexing operation.

What you save is the need to reread/compare/sleep/whatever to handle the 
case where you try to read at the same time as gpsd is writing: This is 
far more costly!
