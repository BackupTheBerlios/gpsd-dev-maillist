<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I was looking through the manpage and noticed that the ISO timestamp
</I>&gt;<i> only has two digits of precision.  I have some GPSes that return it to
</I>&gt;<i> 3 digits (when operating at 5Hz or above sometimes they won't sync to
</I>&gt;<i> the second unless you tell them to).
</I>
As the man page says: &quot;While the one-per-second PPS pulses emitted by
serial GPS units are timed to the GPS system's intrinsic accuracy
limit [3.4e=7 secs], the satellites only emit navigation messages at
0.01-second intervals, and the timestamps in them only carry
0.01-second precision. Thus, the timestamps that gpsd reports in
time/position/velocity messages are normally accurate only to 1/100th
of a second.&quot;

You device may claim accuracy of less than 0.01s, but it's fibbing.

&gt;<i>                                           I also noticed that TPV is
</I>&gt;<i> usually tagged RMC, but GLL has some info and GGA is where altitude
</I>&gt;<i> resides.  The &quot;tag&quot; seems to be arbitrarily chosen, but enough so I
</I>&gt;<i> have to ask why is it there, or if there should be a specification,
</I>&gt;<i> the SKY is always tagged GSV although GSA is also key.
</I>
You've encountered one of the wonderful...let's be nice and call them
&quot;quirks&quot;...that makes writing GPS software such wholesome family
entertainment.

On NMEA devices, a single sample is turned into a burst of sentences that
normally includes a GGA, an RMC, and (sometimes) a GLL.  None of these sentences
are sufficient information to generate a TPV by itself, and they arrive in a
device-dependent random order.

gpsd copes with this by watching sentences come through until it sees a 
timestamp change.  It then recognizes the *previous* sentence as the
cycle ender.  Subsequently arrival of that sentence triggers a TPV report
based on the cumulated data from start of cycle, followed by clearing of
the cumulated data.

The TPV will be decorated with the tag of the cycle-ender sentence.
Usually, though not always, this is an RMC.

(There are entire universes of implementation pain, weird edge cases, and 
hard-learned black art lurking behind this blithe summary. When I say you
do not want to write your own gpsd, this is one of the major reasons.)

&gt;<i> I also noticed that the ISO time entry is only returned for TSV but is
</I>&gt;<i> also in the SKY field list (and it apparently depends on the driver).
</I>
That's correct.  Some devices return skyview data with a timestamp - almost
all binary protocols do this.  NMEA devices do not.  It is, unavoidably,
driver-dependent. 

&gt;<i> It doesn't appear to be set immediately for the TPV, so would probably
</I>&gt;<i> apply to both equally. 
</I>
No.  Skyview sentences are emitted on a separate timing cycle from fix
reports, usually every 5 seconds rather than ever second. We can't 
transplant timestamps from TPVs to SKYs or vice-versa without risking
claiming to know something we don't.

&gt;<i>                           Is there a pattern to which fields are
</I>&gt;<i> populated?
</I>
Fields are populated if the underlying device supplies them or supplies
enough information to compute them.

&gt;<i>  Also I noticed xdop and ydop being populated although I
</I>&gt;<i> only have the GPGSA, so they are computed (unless you have a GPS that
</I>&gt;<i> has these in a sentence).  But I don't think there is enough
</I>&gt;<i> information to compute these as such, only turn hdop into a square.
</I>
But there is.  It's possible to compute DOPs from the skyview with a
bit of matrix algebra. gpsd does this internally because devices are
very bad about returning the full set.  Yes, this is another yawning
pit full of evil black art and another reason not to roll your own.

&gt;<i> Is there a reason computed values are returned alongside the direct
</I>&gt;<i> values?
</I>
I'm not certain what &quot;direct&quot; values you mean.

&gt;<i> On the gpsd.8 manpage and xml, &quot;Responce&quot; is used - that might be a
</I>&gt;<i> non US variant of response, otherwise it is a typo.
</I>
You must be looking at an old version; I can't find this in git head.

&gt;<i> I am also having trouble with the json commands and responses, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> what is required for a gpsd-ng compatible implementation to do (if it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't printout a VERSION object when connected?  Missing WATCH
</I>&gt;<i> responses?  Responses to things it doesn't understand but a newer one
</I>&gt;<i> might).  It says &quot;it does this&quot; in places but not if the order of
</I>&gt;<i> outputs is critical or optional.
</I>
You'll have to specify your questions more exactlly, sorry. As in:
&quot;I send X, Y is expected, I see Z.  What do I do?&quot;
