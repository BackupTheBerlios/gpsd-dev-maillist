<PRE>Let me agree with all three, but add a few things. - this is turning
into a wishlist and design update, and these are just ideas and
suggestions, but here goes:

First, yes, clean up the protocol, but look at it from what a client
might want - ala carte v.s.s combo meal, more structured rules, maybe
remove &quot;tag&quot; or replace it with something more specifically targeted
to a purpose.  Add a debug or log or something to the watch if RAW
doesn't suffice.

Maybe have a combined TPV/SKY such that TPV might include SKY if it was updated.

Add a simple json watch response for stuff like browsers or such with
just time/lat/lon/(alt)/speed/track - maybe this can be TPV.  This
should also be something returnable by xhttpdrequest and easily
processed by browser javascript.

I can't comment on the other WATCH responses, at least not yet, but
those should also be cleaned up as necessary.  There should be one
JSON message format for each kind of data.  If something is
duplicated, we should split or combine the messages.

For multiple devices, allow/select a &quot;best&quot; device based on fix (3d
over 2d), and DOP.  I have some code in mine for this which I can
adapt.  Currently gpsd allows for redundancy but clients would then
have to figure out which one is degraded or not tracking.

For whether something should be inside or outside, one consideration
is if multiple clients would end up doing the same calculation most of
the time.  Do I really want firefox to have to pick out which GPS were
even valid or best?

If we are going to include DoP calculations, XYZ might be good, but
elliptical axes might be better.  My apartment faces SE so I usually
get an arc in that direction.  X and Y are likely to be about equal,
but SW-NE and SE-NW are likely to be very different.

We can leave the decimal points in for NOFLOAT - All I'm doing is
%d.%06d for output which is still probably much faster than %f.  (I do
similar for speed, track, pdop, but in milli-units).

If we do &quot;NOFLOAT&quot; this way - is there a reason to keep FLOAT around
after it is complete?  It should be transparent except for the far
fewer CPU cycles.

POLL should return the same thing WATCH does, maybe with one more
layer of class encapsulation.
The return size for poll will need to be much larger.  TPV + SKY for
ONE GPS is over 900 characters.  I think even the existing format
which only has a few less characters and

 &quot;{&quot;PRN&quot;:19,&quot;el&quot;:39,&quot;az&quot;:163,&quot;ss&quot;:37,&quot;used&quot;:true},&quot;

 is 49 characters, so can be around 700 per GPS (12 in view plus two
WAAS).  Three or more will overflow the 1536 limit. unless we do
something like BEGIN / DEVICE 1 WATCH JSON / DEVICE 2 WATCH JSON... /
END. with a guarantee that even if WATCH is active or DEVICE changes
that it won't interrupt.

I think all the pieces are there, but they could be arranged more
conveniently for a client.

Suggestion, and I don't know if this is practical or useful in your
context but it is in mine - add an optional millisecond &quot;systime&quot; -
the time field is what comes from the messages, but systime would
track the arrival time of the raw messages.  Maybe raw only, but you
might get some measure of latency and if there are multiple interfaces
or sensors it would give a finer and consistent resolution than the
GPS timestamp.  I would expect it to be offset, but would help measure
the latency, e.g. 43050 - $GPRMC ...43.000....  So you could more
easily match actual position at higher rates with different sources.

Note that higher baud rates would help to reduce latency.
