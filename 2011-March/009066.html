cnt = (shm-&gt;count + 1) &amp; mask

NON-ATOMIC shm-&gt;timestamp[cnt] = timestamp;

THE timestamp struct copy is  interrupted in the middle or if only
some but not all writes are complete.

Switch to read process.

Read reads old shm-&gt;count
Reads INCOHERENT shm-&gt; timestame
Reads old shm-&gt;count which is the same as the original.

Switch back to write process.

WRITE memory_barrier(); // All preceding writes must finish at this point
shm-&gt;count++;     // Now the client(s) can read the timestamp

There is an assumption that the sentinels, counts, timestamps are read
and written atomically, but I should explicitly state it here.

The reason you need two sentinels is because you need to know when the
memory is out of sync.

If you put a single barrier at the end, the read might get identical
counts if it reads the count (with the payload) twice before the write
barrier.

If you put a single barrier/update at the beginning, the count will be
synced if the read starts in the middle of the write's update.

You need read barriers to insure the end and start sentinels are
loaded BEFORE and AFTER the sync data is loaded.  Without them,

Read count first time
Initiate Read for payload since it is not atomic.
Read count first time.
Payload reads are NOT completed at this point, some are, some aren't
Write does it's barrier thing.
Final payload reads are done with incoherent new data.
