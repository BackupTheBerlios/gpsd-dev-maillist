Hi,

   I would like to make a marginal comment in regard to this.

   One to my knowledge un(der)developed potential of gpsd is as a
platform for professional, precision geomatics products.  I did look
seriously into this in around 2005/2006 and I believe gpsd would have
been quite adequate for the purpose back then (a handheld survey data
collector).  I did have a high fidelity prototype which worked well, but
I jumped ship before it got to the implementation stage.  Although that
was a bespoke job, I believe there is also potential for a market driven
product there, and that's something I still have in my list of things
I'd like to do sometime in the next two centuries, if I live long enough.

   For that to work, gpsd needs to do two things: support fetching and
presenting as much as data as is available from survey-grade receivers,
and writing to them (the current socket approach is
adequate--per-receiver command logic can be handled outside gpsd). Both
are currently possible, as demonstrated by the Navcom driver which I
wrote as part of the above project.

   One of the requirements that make it possible is that data obtained
through gpsd must not suffer significant loss of precision.

   Now, while there appear to be very valid and worthwhile reasons that
would make it desirable for gpsd to work exclusively at the integer
level, as discussed on this insightful thread, I suggest that in order
to preserve precision at the level at which current and near-term future
geomatics products work, data representation in the order of 10^9
sexagesimal degrees would be required (that's around 1/10th of a
millimetre of a great circle).  Unfortunately that level of granularity
cannot be had with 32 bit integers, so 64 bit storage is the minimum
(2^32 &lt; 360/10^-9 &lt; 2^64).

   So to summarise, if going for integer representation of latitude and
longitude, the unit currently has to be 10^-9th of a sexagesimal degree,
and storage size needs to be 64 bits, if one is to avoid loss of
performance for the reasons explained above.

   P.S.: Back in 2005, I recall there was a similar issue with the
output precision of lat/lon values, but that was only a matter of
changing the printf() spec, an easy patch to apply (which I did).


Regards,
Diego Berge.
