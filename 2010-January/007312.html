Here is the a patchset for the same features, but against SVN rev 6917.
I ran the same verifications on it as previously, and had the same
results.

The last two patches in this set implement -4 and -6 command line
options for (resp.) gpsd and the utilities. The documentation has been
updated accordingly. 

A note though: the API in libgps has changed for gps_open() and
gps_open_r() as a new argument has been added to specifi the adress
family. netlib_connectsock() has undergone the same modifications, but
it doesn't seem to be part of the public API.

Maybe would it be wiser to have functions like gps_open_af() and
gps_open_af_r(), with the two previous ones being wrappers around it? I
saw pro and cons in both solutions, so decided to go for the simplest.
Nothing that sed can't easily fix (:

To have the same behavior as before, AF_UNSPEC (0) should be given for
af. Other valid values are AF_INET and AF_INET6. The C++ bindings don't
have this problem as the change is hidden thanks to polymorphism of
gpsmm::open().


As I side note, I suspect there is a typo in libgps_core.c:main() where
the usage line reads &#8220;usage: libps...&#8221; instead of &#8220;usage: libgps...&#8221;.
                                                             ^

Sorry for the delay in replying. It turns out that actually subscribing
to the IMAP folder a mailing list is delivered helps following it (;
