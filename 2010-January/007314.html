There are some command line switches that are so common that they
really need to be supported.  Like -h and --help for usage, -v and --verbose
for increased verbosity, -V and --version for version, etc.

The IPv4/IPv6 is turing into one of those generalized problems that needs
a generalized solution.  On the one hand you have some systems with
hideously unfixable IPv6 problems that require a -4, and at other times
you need to just kill off the IPv4 and then use the -6.

I am working with one partner of a client that has a DNS server that
hangs infinitely when an AAAA request is sent.  Just one of myriad of
strange IPv6 issues I see.  Since the partner is a bank fixing the
problem is fairly mission critical.

OTOH, I am having trouble finding a use case in gpsd for the -4 or -6.  If
there is an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) I see no issue with gpsd binding to
them.  I could imagine a use for a smarter system that would allow
the user to specify which IPs gpsd could bind to.

It is very common to tell daemons to bind to internal IPs (RFC1918) and
not public ones and this is often specified by interface, IP, or both.
Right now, since there is no authentication on requests to gpsd, and the
requests can do writes which may be malicious, a lot of what gpsd should
do has been pushed back to the firewall.

That is a bigger issue than the -4/-6 so I can agree with you in not
supporting it in this case, but I would hold out hope for eventually
handling the general case.

I do see a case for the -4/-6 in clients.  Sure you can specify the IPv4
or IPv6 address you want to connect to, but usually you want to just
use the DNS host name.  That leads to problems like the one with my
bank (see above).  A DNS request often returns an AAAA and an A record.
Often one of the other is slower, or does not work and you need a way to
select the proper one, thus you need to the -4 and -6 switch.

Time to start playing with IPv6, by some measures there are less than
2 years of IPv4 addresses left.
