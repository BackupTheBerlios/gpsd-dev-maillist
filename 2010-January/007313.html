<PRE>Olivier Mehani &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">olivier.mehani at inria.fr</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Here is the a patchset for the same features, but against SVN rev 6917.
</I>&gt;<i> I ran the same verifications on it as previously, and had the same
</I>&gt;<i> results.
</I>
This is much closer to something we can use.  It now applies cleanly,
but the result has three sets of problems:

(1) Design-level issues with how you enable IPV6 support

(2) splint gets indigestion on the results.  This mostly has to do with 
you being a bit careless about the distinction between in_port_t and int;
I was able to hand-fix it. There's also a slightly nastier problem about
where sockaddr_t is defined.

(3) Some technical problems with autoconf that I haven't completely 
diagnosed yet.

&gt;<i> The last two patches in this set implement -4 and -6 command line
</I>&gt;<i> options for (resp.) gpsd and the utilities. The documentation has been
</I>&gt;<i> updated accordingly. 
</I>
I'm totally uninterested in any patches that add command-line options
for things that gpsd should be able to autoconfigure for itself. This
is one of the design errors I mentioned.
 
&gt;<i> A note though: the API in libgps has changed for gps_open() and
</I>&gt;<i> gps_open_r() as a new argument has been added to specifi the adress
</I>&gt;<i> family. netlib_connectsock() has undergone the same modifications, but
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't seem to be part of the public API.
</I>
That's no good.  We *cannot* go casually breaking user-visible APIs like that.
That's another design error.

&gt;<i> Maybe would it be wiser to have functions like gps_open_af() and
</I>&gt;<i> gps_open_af_r(), with the two previous ones being wrappers around it? I
</I>&gt;<i> saw pro and cons in both solutions, so decided to go for the simplest.
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing that sed can't easily fix (:
</I>
Yes, that would be better.  Please take that approach in the next version 
of your patchset
 
&gt;<i> As I side note, I suspect there is a typo in libgps_core.c:main() where
</I>&gt;<i> the usage line reads &#8220;usage: libps...&#8221; instead of &#8220;usage: libgps...&#8221;.
</I>
Good catch.  I've fixed it.

I think the best way to proceed is to take this in stages, and roughly
from the inside out.

First, I'd like to see a patch that does nothing but make the netlib.c
functions IPV6-aware. Please splint the results and change int and unsigned
short int to in_port_t where you need to.

Let's defer the autoconf problem until later and have everyone call
netlib_connectsock() with AF_UNSPEC for now.
