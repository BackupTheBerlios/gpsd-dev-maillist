<PRE>Well, I did not code any of this leap second warning stuff into the gpsd
timesync routines.  Mainly because with most receivers I checked it would
be impossible or very difficult to retrieve the warning information.
(at that time, my belief was that decoding the almanac frames would be
&quot;very difficult&quot;.  later, Eric still did it)
However, there also had been no leap second for a long time, and proposals
to not have them anymore have been heard.

It was only after the leap second that I realized that DCF77 (a longwave
transmitter) does provide that information and the driver (built-in in
ntpd) does use it.  It meant that my system stepped through the leap
second in the way it is supposed to.
But then, when looking at neighboring ntp servers I found that those that
referred to other GPS-based references all were 1000ms off, and only found
about this at the end of their poll cycles (often 1024s).  So, after about
15 minutes everybody was confused.
This seems to indicate that most GPS references do not communicate leap
second information, just like gpsd.

&gt;<i> (I never liked the idea of discontinuous scales in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> The elaborate ntp leap warning bits on the wire with the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> stepping the time at just the right moment always struck me as
</I>&gt;<i> violating the KISS principle.  Now I'm more convinced than ever that
</I>&gt;<i> this low-level protocols shouldn't be hop, skipping and jumping things
</I>&gt;<i> around.  We should be treating leap seconds the same way we treat
</I>&gt;<i> daylight savings time, push that into the display routines that
</I>&gt;<i> convert real-seconds-since-the-epoch to the date-time string.)
</I>
I agree!  Of course the tradional unix time routines handled DST but never
considered leap seconds, and this was patched on afterwards.
I can understand that the original C library designers did not want the
time conversion routines to access the disk.  That was slow in those days.
So, the original C library routines only used a string from the
environment (TZ) to base all its calculations on, and those calculations
were all hardcoded in the library routine.
Of course the routines we have now use external files already, and an
extra file with a list of leap seconds would be no problem (aside from the
problem of updating that file).

No idea how many programs would be broken when there suddenly was a 14
second offset...  I remember that I sometimes used (time % 86400) to
quickly get a time-of-day, this would of course no longer be valid.
