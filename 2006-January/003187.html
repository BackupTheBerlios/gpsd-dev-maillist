No, but I wonder why the bash developers put it into their shell instead
of into the kernel...
Probably there is a difficulty with getting features like this accepted by
the kernel group, if only because the security implications of it could be
an unpleasant surprise.

Years ago I discussed the idea of implementing a &quot;pipe as a file&quot; feature
in the kernel, before I knew that Perl implements this (or maybe before it
actually did, I don't know).
So, you could open a file &quot;| programname&quot; and the kernel would perform the
proper pipe/fork/dup2/exec sequence automatically.  So, any program could
write its data to a pipe or read from a pipe.

Of course features like this could cause security problems in any
&quot;restricted&quot; environment, where applications assume that users cannot get
outside of the environment defined by the application.  It would require
some permissions system and/or an enable/disable mechanism, which would
complicate the whole thing so much that it is no longer worth it.

Of course it could be built as a preload library that replaces the file
open calls.
Maybe bash even does it this way?  I know the inputline editing feature
that it uses is available as a library...
