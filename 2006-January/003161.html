The leap event was a royal mess here.  A few hours before midnight UTC
I noticed that one of the stratum-1's I poll (a CDMA reference) was
1000ms off.  If this was a movie the sinister foreboding music would
have been playing in the background.

At 4pm PST (midnight UTC) my main machine (a stratum-2) found that
instead of the usual 1 or 2 mS offset it was suddenly 1000mS off.  I
had forgotten to instrument the stratum-1 which was connected to an
Oncore M12.  Whatever mechanism it was supposed to use to telegraph
the leap event to its clients failed in some spectacular way.  It took
8 hours before the main machine managed to slew the time back into
sync.  

(I never liked the idea of discontinuous scales in the first place.
The elaborate ntp leap warning bits on the wire with the kernel
stepping the time at just the right moment always struck me as
violating the KISS principle.  Now I'm more convinced than ever that
this low-level protocols shouldn't be hop, skipping and jumping things
around.  We should be treating leap seconds the same way we treat
daylight savings time, push that into the display routines that
convert real-seconds-since-the-epoch to the date-time string.)
