<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I started investigating and learned that with PPS_ENABLE, GPSD duly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spawns a thread to monitor the carrier-detect line.  However, since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's no physical carrier-detect line I guess I should not be too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surprised that the ioctls to query TIOCM_CAR fail (with an invalid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> argument error on Linux FC4).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you noted, there is no Carrier Detect on a USB conenctor, so PPS,
</I>&gt;<i> which uses the CD line can not possibly work on USB.  There would be no
</I>&gt;<i> way to map a PPS signal in USB since USB is an asynchronous protocl.
</I>
Well, when you get a USB to RS232 cable for use with a modem or other
external device you will find that it *does* support signalling like
DCD and CTS.  Apparently these devices send a special message over the
USB protocol for handshake line status changes, and the driver on the
PC side decodes these messages and builds an emulated &quot;handshake line
state&quot; that communication programs can query just like on a standard
serial line.

However, the USB driver does not implement the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl so it
is a bit impractical to implement it in the PPS thread (it would have
to poll the DCD signal in a tight loop, instead of just remaining in
a sleeping state until it actually changes).

&gt;<i> Worse yet, USB 2.0 does stor and forward of USB packets further distorting
</I>&gt;<i> any syncronicity required to effectively pass a PPS signal.
</I>
That is true, but it would be much better than looking at the serial
messages.

However, what kills all this is that apparently the gps receiver
manufacturers do not wire the PPS signal to an (emulated) handshake signal
in their USB products.   They apparently do not expect anyone to be
interested in this, as I think it is just a matter of a circuit board
trace.  At least in those receivers that use existing gps receiver chips
and USB serial port chips.
