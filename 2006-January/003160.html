<PRE>First, all the best for everyone in 2006.

Well, did anyone notice problems with the leap second last night?
I monitored some NTP servers and there were quite many that were not aware
of the phenomenon and just treated it as a sudden 1-second time jump.  So
they lost lock and feverishly tried to lock on eachother, sometimes
jumping back and forth a couple of times.  Looking now, it seems to have
stabilized again but there probably still are timeservers that are one
second off.

My own system has a DCF77 receiver besides gpsd locking, so it was
informed of the change (DCF77 sends a leap second warning beforehand and
ntpd uses this warning to neatly step through this leapsecond).
So, I could not really test how gpsd would live through the change with
only gpsd as a time reference.
However, both my Trimble and Jupiter receivers were still on-time in gpsd
after the leap second, so the leap_seconds data was processed correctly.

This may be different for SiRF receivers (depending on the firmware version).
You may now see a 1-second offset between your system time and the GPS
receiver, or between your system time and that of the rest of the world.

As I noted before, the offset in timebase.h should be changed from 13 to 14.
The START_SUBFRAME value is also not completely correct (should be
1136073600) but that does not matter too much.

Anyway, the code that uses the subframe data is only run once.  So when
you have a SiRF receiver in binary mode, you probably at least need to
restart gpsd to get correct time again.
