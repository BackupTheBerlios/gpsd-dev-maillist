Naw, I just work for a survey company, so I've got lots of equipment,
but I'm supposed to be using it mostly, not designing for it.  I
thought my raw binary dump might be enough to get someone to make it
work with whatever spotty descriptions are out on the net.  Mind you,
I'm not asking for support, I just figured since I had the equipment,
and the stuff is like $1000, even to rent, I'd do my part to advance
the open source world by offering up the dump.  It does occur to me,
of course, that there are alot of surveyers out there, and this stuff
just gets broadcast out on the air (usually over a 35W 450MHz radio),
that gpsd could improve alot of people's lives if they were willing to
buy 450MHz radios.  Another thing is that (in the USA at least) a
whole lot of the systems are Trimble, and they are configured to use
Trimble's &quot;CMR/CMR+&quot; out of the box instead of RTCM.  I suspect
Trimble may have a vested interest in people adopting that over RTCM,
however (the Leica's we have support it), so a call to my local tech
support rep might actually provide some documentation on that for less
than $100.  These weird standards bodies that exist just to sell paper
(as far as I can tell) all make me gag.

Best,
Steve
