<PRE>Hi,

Eric S. Raymond:
&gt;<i> &gt; s/changed/re-invented/, unfortunately.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, crap.  Do you mean the write a completely different packet protocol?
</I>
Yes, basically.

To quote extensively from <A HREF="https://ssl29.pair.com/dmarkle/puborder.php?show=3">https://ssl29.pair.com/dmarkle/puborder.php?show=3</A>
where you can order the thing for $80 ($110 if you also want 2.3):

::<i> This standard has been developed by RTCM Special Committee 104 as a more
</I>::<i> efficient alternative to the documents entitled &quot;RTCM Recommended
</I>::<i> Standards for Differential Navstar GPS Service, Version 2.x&quot;. (Current
</I>::<i> version is 2.3, now designated as RTCM 10302.3.) Service providers and
</I>::<i> vendors represented on the SC-104 Committee requested the development of
</I>::<i> a new standard that would be more efficient, easy to use, and more
</I>::<i> easily adaptable to new situations. The main complaint was that the
</I>::<i> Version 2.x parity scheme, which uses words with 24 bits of data
</I>::<i> followed by 6 bits of parity, was wasteful of bandwidth. Another
</I>::<i> complaint was that the parity was not independent from word to word.
</I>::<i> Still another was that even with so many bits devoted to parity, the
</I>::<i> actual integrity of the message was not as high as it should be. Plus,
</I>::<i> 30-bit words are awkward to handle. The new standard, Version 3, is
</I>::<i> intended to correct these weaknesses.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> The initial release of the new standard, i.e., Version 3.0, consisted
</I>::<i> primarily of messages designed to support real-time kinematic (RTK)
</I>::<i> operations. The reason for this emphasis is that RTK operation involves
</I>::<i> broadcasting a lot of information, and thus benefits the most from an
</I>::<i> efficient data format. Version 3.0 provided messages that support GPS
</I>::<i> and GLONASS RTK operations, including code and carrier phase
</I>::<i> observables, antenna parameters, and ancillary system parameters. This
</I>::<i> release, Version 3.1 - now designated as RTCM Standard 10403.1,
</I>::<i> incorporates GPS Network Corrections, which enable a mobile receiver to
</I>::<i> obtain accurate RTK information valid over a large area. In addition,
</I>::<i> new GPS and GLONASS messages provide orbital parameters to assist in
</I>::<i> rapid acquisition. A Unicode text message is also provided for the
</I>::<i> transmission of textual data. Finally, a set of messages are reserved
</I>::<i> for vendors who want to encapsulate proprietary data in their broadcasts.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> Unlike Version 2.x, this standard does not include tentative messages.
</I>::<i> The messages in Version 3 have undergone testing for validity and
</I>::<i> interoperability, and are considered to be permanent. Future
</I>::<i> modifications of the standard may change the meaning of reserved bits or
</I>::<i> provide additional clarifying text, but no changes will be made in the
</I>::<i> data fields. Changes will require new messages to be developed. In
</I>::<i> addition to the messages described in this document, the Committee is
</I>::<i> also developing a number of new messages, which are described in a
</I>::<i> separate document. As new messages and capabilities have been
</I>::<i> demonstrated through validity and interoperability testing, they will be
</I>::<i> incorporated into future versions of the Version 3 standard. RTCM SC-104
</I>::<i> believes that the new Standard 10403.1 for DGNSS services will prove
</I>::<i> useful in supporting highly accurate differential and kinematic
</I>::<i> positioning as well as a wide range of navigation applications worldwide
</I>::<i> throughout the next decade.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> Note that Version 3 messages are not compatible with Version 2.x. Since
</I>::<i> many receivers have been designed and programmed for use with Version
</I>::<i> 2.x messages, RTCM is maintaining both standards 10402.3 and 10403.1 as
</I>::<i> &quot;current&quot; standards.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> Amendment 1 is an extensive addition that adds RTCM messages containing
</I>::<i> transformation data and information about Coordinate Reference Systems.
</I>::<i> For RTCM data supporting a RTK service, coordinates are measured within
</I>::<i> the ITRF or a regional realization. Surveyors and other users of RTK
</I>::<i> services must normally present their results in the coordinates of local
</I>::<i> datums. Therefore, coordinate transformations are necessary. By having
</I>::<i> RTCM messages that contain transformation data and information about the
</I>::<i> Coordinate Reference Systems, the users of the RTK service can obtain
</I>::<i> their results in the desired datum without any manual operations. The
</I>::<i> RTK service providers can then ensure that current information for the
</I>::<i> computation of the transformations is always used. The convenience of
</I>::<i> this method will promote the acceptance of RTK services.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> Amendment 2 adds residual error messages to support the use of
</I>::<i> Non-Physical or Computed Reference Stations in a Network RTK
</I>::<i> environment.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> The Network RTK correction information provided to a rover can be
</I>::<i> considered as interpolated corrections between the reference stations in
</I>::<i> the RTK network.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> Depending on the actual conditions of the atmosphere, this interpolation
</I>::<i> is not perfect.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> A residual interpolation error has to be expected.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> With sufficient redundancy in the RTK network, the network server
</I>::<i> process can provide an estimate for residual interpolation errors.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> Such quality estimates may be used by the rover to optimize the
</I>::<i> performance of RTK solutions.
</I>::<i> 
</I>::<i> The values may be considered by the rover as a priori estimates only,
</I>::<i> with sufficient tracking data available the rover might be able to judge
</I>::<i> residual geometric and ionospheric errors itself.
</I>
In other words, there's good reasons why everybody transmits 3.0 instead
of 2.3 these days.

&gt;<i> Chris says he has has 3.0 docs. As to who's going to do it, I dunno yet.
</I>&gt;<i> Could well be me.
</I>
OK.
