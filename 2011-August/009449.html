<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> 3. As I understand pydistutils (setup.py) is called right from
</I>&gt;<i> SCons. Normally, when some port (for example, of some python module)
</I>&gt;<i> uses pydistutils, it provides setup.py with certain arguments, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, -c -O1 so python bytecode files (.pyc, .pyo) are created.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously this can't be done in this case.
</I>
Could you show me some examples of options you pass to setup.py? -c -O1 sound
more like gcc options which should not be passed to setup.py bu instead the
system's distutils/setuptools install should know how to compile the files properly.

&gt;<i> This results in only *.py files installed, so if some python program
</I>&gt;<i> which uses `gps' module is run by root user, python will create
</I>&gt;<i> .pyc/.pyo files on its own, polluting system directory and making a
</I>&gt;<i> port unable to deinstall cleanly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've solved this with calling python from a port after the installation
</I>&gt;<i> to create the bytecode.
</I>
Good catch, byte compiled files should be installed - and if not needed, removed
by the packager instead the other way round.
I'll fix that.


&gt;<i> 8. Last but not least, the only problem I couldn't solve is dbus
</I>&gt;<i> support. On FreeBSD dbus is installed from the ports, so pkg-config
</I>&gt;<i> knows about it. However gpsd doesn't build with dbus_export=yes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cc -o ais_json.os -c -Wextra -Wall -Wno-uninitialized -Wno-missing-field-initializers -Wcast-align -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Wreturn-type -Wimplicit-function-declaration -D_GNU_SOURCE -O2 -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -O2 -fPIC ais_json.c
</I>&gt;<i> In file included from ais_json.c:18:
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.h:979:23: error: dbus/dbus.h: No such file or directory
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> looks like SCons doesn't take cflags from pkgconfig at all, and I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't figure out how to make it do so.
</I>
Can't reproduce that here, scons properly adds
-I/usr/include/dbus-1.0 -I/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dbus-1.0/include
from the dbus .pc files.
Could you please send me the .pc files from your dbus installation?


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS. Judging from my own experience as both packager and ex- scons
</I>&gt;<i> user, I'd warn you against switching to SCons. It doesn't do enough
</I>&gt;<i> job required from build system, and its build scripts, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> being an abstraction from target system, tend to become unmaintainable
</I>&gt;<i> shell-script-alikes written in python consisting of endless tests and
</I>&gt;<i> conditions for certain features of target systems. CMake is a much
</I>&gt;<i> better alternative, providing clearer syntax and doing most work
</I>&gt;<i> for a user (library detection, for instance: as easy as
</I>&gt;<i> find_package(Curses) and you have compiler/linker arguments to use
</I>&gt;<i> the library, and you shouldn't care of pkg-config, or other methods
</I>&gt;<i> to determine path to the includes/library), also being friendly to
</I>&gt;<i> packagers, as many aspects of its work is customizable with command
</I>&gt;<i> line arguments.
</I>
unfortunately I have to say that I tend to have the same opinion. Although
autotools is a real pain, it is *much* easier to use from a packager's POV than
scons. Same for cmake. And i can be more or less sure, that libraries are being
built properly instead of trusting some lines of Python code which showed
various bugs already.
