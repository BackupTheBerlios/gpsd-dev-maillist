<PRE>I believe the scons recipe is now good for current versions of Ubuntu,
Debian, and OpenBSD; also freebsd8, Fedora 14, and Debian kFreeBSD.

There are two platforms I'm unsure of because of a recent change.  On
Thu Aug 25 I merged a patch from Gleb Smirnoff that took advantage of
the ability Ubuntu and most other Linuxes have to include dependencies
in shared libraries.  The objective was to relieve C client developers
of having to specify an additional -lm on their link lines

This change turns out to break the build on recent Red Hat distros, which
disable shared-library dependencies.  It might also cause problems elsewhere,
but given the timing of successful build reports the only cases I'm
actually worried about are Darwin and whatever Michael R. Davis is running, 
if that's different from Fedora 14.

Michael and Kurt: Please recheck your builds with repo head. If you get
link failures that look like -lm is missing, see near line 50 of SConstruct -
we'll need to add a guard there that sets imload=False for your platform.

All other port owners: It can't hurt to recheck your build.

Otherwise, we're ready for the release.  I have run the full battery of 
regression tests and code-sanity checks, live-tested the clients, and
everything looks clean.

Militias, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves and
include all men capable of bearing arms. [...] To preserve liberty it is
essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be
taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.
        -- Senator Richard Henry Lee, 1788, on &quot;militia&quot; in the 2nd Amendment
