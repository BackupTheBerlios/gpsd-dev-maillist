<PRE>Dmitry Marakasov &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">amdmi3 at amdmi3.ru</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I've been helping the maintainer of FreeBSD gpsd port ([1]) to
</I>&gt;<i> update it to version 3.0 and had ran into several problems with
</I>&gt;<i> build. I'll list them here in hope that they will be fixed upstream
</I>&gt;<i> and/or this helps other packagers.
</I>
I'm attempting to merge fixes for these in a way that will be helpful for
other platforms.
 
&gt;<i> 1. Parallel build doesn't work. If scons is called with -j the build
</I>&gt;<i> may fail. As I understand, it's because some programs from gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> distribution are linked with -lgpsd without dependency on scons
</I>&gt;<i> target which builds libgpsd:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> gpsdlibs = [&quot;-lgpsd&quot;] + usblibs + bluezlibs + gpslibs
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> gpsdecode = env.Program('gpsdecode', ['gpsdecode.c'], parse_flags=gpsdlibs+rtlibs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SCons doesn't know of this implicit dependency and by the time these
</I>&gt;<i> programs are linked, libgpsd may not be ready yet.
</I>
I added Depends relations that should fix this.

&gt;<i> 2. Build failures with some options disabled: netfeed=no, reconfigure=no
</I>&gt;<i> or socket_export=no:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-nonetfeed-3.0.log">http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-nonetfeed-3.0.log</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-noreconfigure-3.0.log">http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-noreconfigure-3.0.log</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-nosockexport-3.0.log">http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-nosockexport-3.0.log</A>
</I>
I was able to reproduce and fix minor problems with netfeed=no 
and reconfigure=no, but not sockexport=no. Please try this build again from the
repo head version and explain the difficulties you run into.

&gt;<i> 3. As I understand pydistutils (setup.py) is called right from
</I>&gt;<i> SCons. Normally, when some port (for example, of some python module)
</I>&gt;<i> uses pydistutils, it provides setup.py with certain arguments, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, -c -O1 so python bytecode files (.pyc, .pyo) are created.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously this can't be done in this case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This results in only *.py files installed, so if some python program
</I>&gt;<i> which uses `gps' module is run by root user, python will create
</I>&gt;<i> .pyc/.pyo files on its own, polluting system directory and making a
</I>&gt;<i> port unable to deinstall cleanly.
</I>
You say &quot;Obviously this can't be done in this case.&quot; but it's not obvious
to me, and I am reluctant to attempt a fix without that understanding.
Can you explain further?
 
&gt;<i> I've solved this with calling python from a port after the installation
</I>&gt;<i> to create the bytecode.
</I>
It would be better if the build recipe did not require this, of course.

&gt;<i> 4. SConscript takes some variables to customize build from the
</I>&gt;<i> environement, which is great, as FreeBSD ports are required to respect
</I>&gt;<i> syetemwide CC/CXX/CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS. However, if {C,CXX}FLAGS has multiple
</I>&gt;<i> arguments (e.g. &quot;-O2 -pipe -march=prescott&quot;), it takes these as a single
</I>&gt;<i> argument, which leads to gcc error. Here's how I've solved it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -        env[j]=os.getenv(i)
</I>&gt;<i> +        if i == &quot;CFLAGS&quot; or i == &quot;CCFLAGS&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> +           env.Replace(**{j: Split(os.getenv(i))})
</I>&gt;<i> +        else:
</I>&gt;<i> +           env.Replace(**{j: os.getenv(i)})
</I>
I have merged this.

&gt;<i> 5. Some warnings are enabled if the compiler is gcc. However on FreeBSD,
</I>&gt;<i> gcc is named cc, so:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -if env['CC'] == 'gcc':
</I>&gt;<i> +if env['CC'] == 'gcc' or env['CC'] == 'cc':
</I>&gt;<i>      # Enable all GCC warnings except uninitialized and
</I>&gt;<i>      # missing-field-initializers, which we can't help triggering because
</I>&gt;<i>      # of the way some of the JSON-parsing code is generated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not the solution though, as gcc (and other gcc-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> compilers) may have other names, such as gcc45 or clang. This
</I>&gt;<i> condition should not be based on a compiler binary name.
</I>
I have added a check for freebsd platform and name cc. I am reluctant
to add a fragile and complex test for this capability; I'll do it only
if the guard becomes unreasonably complex.

&gt;<i> 6. FreeBSD has some libraries in the base system (as opposed to the
</I>&gt;<i> ports collection), and this includes libncurses and libusb.
</I>&gt;<i> Base system doesn't use pkg-config, so .pc files for these libraries
</I>&gt;<i> are not available at all, so pkg-config (which is installed from
</I>&gt;<i> ports) doesn't know anything of ncurses or libusb and cannot be used
</I>&gt;<i> to detect them. I've fixed that by replacing pkg-config calls with
</I>&gt;<i> library names, which is ok since being in the base system, they do
</I>&gt;<i> not require any specific compile/link flags.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if env['ncurses']:
</I>&gt;<i> -    if config.CheckPKG('ncurses'):
</I>&gt;<i> -        ncurseslibs = pkg_config('ncurses')
</I>&gt;<i> -    elif config.CheckExecutable('ncurses5-config --version', 'ncurses5-config'):
</I>&gt;<i> -        ncurseslibs = ['!ncurses5-config --libs --cflags']
</I>&gt;<i> -    else:
</I>&gt;<i> -        ncurseslibs= []
</I>&gt;<i> +    ncurseslibs= [ '-lncurses' ]
</I>&gt;<i>  else:
</I>&gt;<i>       ncurseslibs= []
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -if env['usb'] and config.CheckPKG('libusb-1.0'):
</I>&gt;<i> -    confdefs.append(&quot;#define HAVE_LIBUSB 1\n&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> -    try:
</I>&gt;<i> -        usblibs = pkg_config('libusb-1.0')
</I>&gt;<i> -    except OSError:
</I>&gt;<i> -        print &quot;pkg_config is confused about the state of libusb-1.0.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> -        usblibs = []
</I>&gt;<i> +if env['usb']:
</I>&gt;<i> +    usblibs = [ &quot;-lusb&quot; ]
</I>&gt;<i>  else:
</I>&gt;<i>       confdefs.append(&quot;/* #undef HAVE_LIBUSB */\n&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>            usblibs = []
</I>
I have modified the conditional in a way that handles both cases.

&gt;<i> 7. On FreeBSD, pkgconfig files are installed into
</I>&gt;<i> ${PREFIX}/libdata/pkgconfig, not ${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig, so
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -pkgconfigdir = os.path.join(installdir('libdir'), 'pkgconfig')
</I>&gt;<i> +pkgconfigdir = os.path.join(env['prefix'], 'libdata', 'pkgconfig')
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that can be made custimizable via pathopts.
</I>
That's probably the leat-effort solution.

&gt;<i> 8. Last but not least, the only problem I couldn't solve is dbus
</I>&gt;<i> support. On FreeBSD dbus is installed from the ports, so pkg-config
</I>&gt;<i> knows about it. However gpsd doesn't build with dbus_export=yes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cc -o ais_json.os -c -Wextra -Wall -Wno-uninitialized -Wno-missing-field-initializers -Wcast-align -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Wreturn-type -Wimplicit-function-declaration -D_GNU_SOURCE -O2 -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -O2 -fPIC ais_json.c
</I>&gt;<i> In file included from ais_json.c:18:
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.h:979:23: error: dbus/dbus.h: No such file or directory
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> looks like SCons doesn't take cflags from pkgconfig at all, and I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't figure out how to make it do so.
</I>
Try raising bzed (Bernd Zeimetz) on IRC. He's our pkgconfig expert
and can probably fix this faster than I could.
 
&gt;<i> PS. Judging from my own experience as both packager and ex- scons
</I>&gt;<i> user, I'd warn you against switching to SCons.
</I>
Too late. :-)

&gt;<i>                                           It doesn't do enough
</I>&gt;<i> job required from build system, and its build scripts, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> being an abstraction from target system, tend to become unmaintainable
</I>&gt;<i> shell-script-alikes written in python consisting of endless tests and
</I>&gt;<i> conditions for certain features of target systems. CMake is a much
</I>&gt;<i> better alternative, providing clearer syntax and doing most work
</I>&gt;<i> for a user (library detection, for instance: as easy as
</I>&gt;<i> find_package(Curses) and you have compiler/linker arguments to use
</I>&gt;<i> the library, and you shouldn't care of pkg-config, or other methods
</I>&gt;<i> to determine path to the includes/library), also being friendly to
</I>&gt;<i> packagers, as many aspects of its work is customizable with command
</I>&gt;<i> line arguments.
</I>
Experience has taught me to hate two-phase build systems based on
makefile generation (Imake, autotools, cmake) with a burning passion.
Debugging problems is horrible because errors at the level of the
generated Makefile cannot be readily traced to the source line in the 
recipe.  So, no, cmake is out of the question.
