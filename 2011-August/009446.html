<PRE>Hi!

I've been helping the maintainer of FreeBSD gpsd port ([1]) to
update it to version 3.0 and had ran into several problems with
build. I'll list them here in hope that they will be fixed upstream
and/or this helps other packagers.

1. Parallel build doesn't work. If scons is called with -j the build
may fail. As I understand, it's because some programs from gpsd
distribution are linked with -lgpsd without dependency on scons
target which builds libgpsd:

gpsdlibs = [&quot;-lgpsd&quot;] + usblibs + bluezlibs + gpslibs
...
gpsdecode = env.Program('gpsdecode', ['gpsdecode.c'], parse_flags=gpsdlibs+rtlibs

SCons doesn't know of this implicit dependency and by the time these
programs are linked, libgpsd may not be ready yet.

2. Build failures with some options disabled: netfeed=no, reconfigure=no
or socket_export=no:

<A HREF="http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-nonetfeed-3.0.log">http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-nonetfeed-3.0.log</A>
<A HREF="http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-noreconfigure-3.0.log">http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-noreconfigure-3.0.log</A>
<A HREF="http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-nosockexport-3.0.log">http://people.freebsd.org/~amdmi3/gpsd-nosockexport-3.0.log</A>

3. As I understand pydistutils (setup.py) is called right from
SCons. Normally, when some port (for example, of some python module)
uses pydistutils, it provides setup.py with certain arguments, for
example, -c -O1 so python bytecode files (.pyc, .pyo) are created.
Obviously this can't be done in this case.

This results in only *.py files installed, so if some python program
which uses `gps' module is run by root user, python will create
.pyc/.pyo files on its own, polluting system directory and making a
port unable to deinstall cleanly.

I've solved this with calling python from a port after the installation
to create the bytecode.

4. SConscript takes some variables to customize build from the
environement, which is great, as FreeBSD ports are required to respect
syetemwide CC/CXX/CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS. However, if {C,CXX}FLAGS has multiple
arguments (e.g. &quot;-O2 -pipe -march=prescott&quot;), it takes these as a single
argument, which leads to gcc error. Here's how I've solved it:

-        env[j]=os.getenv(i)
+        if i == &quot;CFLAGS&quot; or i == &quot;CCFLAGS&quot;:
+           env.Replace(**{j: Split(os.getenv(i))})
+        else:
+           env.Replace(**{j: os.getenv(i)})

5. Some warnings are enabled if the compiler is gcc. However on FreeBSD,
gcc is named cc, so:

-if env['CC'] == 'gcc':
+if env['CC'] == 'gcc' or env['CC'] == 'cc':
     # Enable all GCC warnings except uninitialized and
     # missing-field-initializers, which we can't help triggering because
     # of the way some of the JSON-parsing code is generated.

This is not the solution though, as gcc (and other gcc-compatible
compilers) may have other names, such as gcc45 or clang. This
condition should not be based on a compiler binary name.

6. FreeBSD has some libraries in the base system (as opposed to the
ports collection), and this includes libncurses and libusb.
Base system doesn't use pkg-config, so .pc files for these libraries
are not available at all, so pkg-config (which is installed from
ports) doesn't know anything of ncurses or libusb and cannot be used
to detect them. I've fixed that by replacing pkg-config calls with
library names, which is ok since being in the base system, they do
not require any specific compile/link flags.

if env['ncurses']:
-    if config.CheckPKG('ncurses'):
-        ncurseslibs = pkg_config('ncurses')
-    elif config.CheckExecutable('ncurses5-config --version', 'ncurses5-config'):
-        ncurseslibs = ['!ncurses5-config --libs --cflags']
-    else:
-        ncurseslibs= []
+    ncurseslibs= [ '-lncurses' ]
 else:
      ncurseslibs= []

-if env['usb'] and config.CheckPKG('libusb-1.0'):
-    confdefs.append(&quot;#define HAVE_LIBUSB 1\n&quot;)
-    try:
-        usblibs = pkg_config('libusb-1.0')
-    except OSError:
-        print &quot;pkg_config is confused about the state of libusb-1.0.&quot;
-        usblibs = []
+if env['usb']:
+    usblibs = [ &quot;-lusb&quot; ]
 else:
      confdefs.append(&quot;/* #undef HAVE_LIBUSB */\n&quot;)
           usblibs = []

7. On FreeBSD, pkgconfig files are installed into
${PREFIX}/libdata/pkgconfig, not ${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig, so

-pkgconfigdir = os.path.join(installdir('libdir'), 'pkgconfig')
+pkgconfigdir = os.path.join(env['prefix'], 'libdata', 'pkgconfig')

I guess that can be made custimizable via pathopts.

8. Last but not least, the only problem I couldn't solve is dbus
support. On FreeBSD dbus is installed from the ports, so pkg-config
knows about it. However gpsd doesn't build with dbus_export=yes:

cc -o ais_json.os -c -Wextra -Wall -Wno-uninitialized -Wno-missing-field-initializers -Wcast-align -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Wreturn-type -Wimplicit-function-declaration -D_GNU_SOURCE -O2 -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -O2 -fPIC ais_json.c
In file included from ais_json.c:18:
gpsd.h:979:23: error: dbus/dbus.h: No such file or directory

looks like SCons doesn't take cflags from pkgconfig at all, and I
couldn't figure out how to make it do so.

PS. Judging from my own experience as both packager and ex- scons
user, I'd warn you against switching to SCons. It doesn't do enough
job required from build system, and its build scripts, instead of
being an abstraction from target system, tend to become unmaintainable
shell-script-alikes written in python consisting of endless tests and
conditions for certain features of target systems. CMake is a much
better alternative, providing clearer syntax and doing most work
for a user (library detection, for instance: as easy as
find_package(Curses) and you have compiler/linker arguments to use
the library, and you shouldn't care of pkg-config, or other methods
to determine path to the includes/library), also being friendly to
packagers, as many aspects of its work is customizable with command
line arguments.
