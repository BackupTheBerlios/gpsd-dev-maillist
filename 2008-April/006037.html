<PRE>Heya,

&gt;<i> gpsd runs on a lot of embedded devices and so each library included
</I>&gt;<i> invokes a real penalty. 
</I>&gt;<i> Bringing in a 60k+ library just to see if
</I>&gt;<i> a file exists in /sys seems excessive to me.
</I>

1. You can always use auto* (aka configure and friends) to configure at
build time to use of libusb or not - that's what configure was made for.
Add something like --with-libusb, and if it's not enabled stick with /proc.
2. Not sure where you got the 60k from, libusb on openwrt is about 27k
for example.
3. As I said before - you can't rely on an existing /sys - even the line
you have in there now should be removed imho, there're better/other ways
to check that. Even worse, the sysfs filenames may change between Kernel
versions, you're supposed to use libsysfs because of that reason. And
don't forget that /sys does not exist on 2.4 kernels, which are still
used on a lot of embedded devices. So where's the sense in using it? If
you want to stick with a hack to save embedded devices from an extra
library, use /proc.

&gt;<i>  If you wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> code up a Garmin driver using libusb then I could see that getting
</I>&gt;<i> accepted in the trunk.
</I>
You're not seriously asking me to fork the driver?
See it this way: Garmin USB support IS broken on Ubuntu and (if I
remember right) Fedora, chances are good it will be broken in Debian's
Lenny, and more distributions will follow. So I'll either remove your
Garmin USB driver in Debian (because it's useless), or I'll patch it to
use libusb. That pretty much depends on my mood, spare time and if I
find access to a Garmin USB GPSr for a long enough time.


Cheers,

Bernd
