<PRE>Amaury Jacquot &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">sxpert at esitcom.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-IO-Channels.html">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-IO-Channels.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> this simplifies greatly over bare select/poll syscalls, and helps 
</I>&gt;<i> portability
</I>
OK, I've read it.  I don't think this is simpler than select(2), which
we already have working (yes, under 2.6).  Furthermore it would tie us
to glibc.  I don't see any good reason to do that -- gpsd does have some 
users on *BSD systems.  

My mind is open if there is some valuable feature to be gained from changing
the implementation, but I have not heard one yet.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;* it's able to log to a file information (that allows for later
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;processing)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Yup, we can do that too.  Maybe not as cleanly, but I designed the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;new logfile format so that at -D 3 it's trivial to filter for the NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;events.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> this uses a binary format that has fixed sized records, and a sig at the 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning
</I>
What other software uses this format?  Why is it interesting?

I note a problem with it -- the timestamps only have 1-second resolution.
This would throw away some of the timing data from SiRF-II chips, which
report milliseconds.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;* will act as a dbus service, sending info every second (or faster,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;depending on the gps receiver)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;That sounds like a useful thing which we should incorporate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> not yet written though, was concentrating on getting dbus working in my 
</I>&gt;<i> sound-server (see <A HREF="http://www.navsys.org/sound-server/">http://www.navsys.org/sound-server/</A> )
</I>
OK.  I wouldn't object to seeing this code in gpsd when it happens.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;If you have any sanity-checking I don't, I'll cheerfully take it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> basicly does  waits for a $ to show up, and does the check codes 
</I>&gt;<i> calculation for each sentence, rejecting all non valid sentences
</I>
Yup, gpsd does bad-checksum detection too.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;I downloaded the NavSys source, but I don't see ngpsd in it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> it's in a separate package, latest is at (while cvs is down)
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.navsys.org/ngpsd/dl/ngpsd-2004-10-26.tar.bz2">http://www.navsys.org/ngpsd/dl/ngpsd-2004-10-26.tar.bz2</A>
</I>
Got it.  Am looking now...

OK, you handle PGRME.  We don't.  OTOH, you don't do GPGLL nor GPVTG.

Your gpsd 'g'.  We removed that.  I doubt you use it.  Otherwise our command
set is a superset of yours.  Note that we return ? for an undefined value 
rather than 0 or 0.0.

We don't generate your binary log.  I have to tell you I don't like that
format, both because it throws away subsecond timestamp info and because
I think binary file formats are generically wrong.  But there is room for
negotiation on this if something else in your suite cares about it.

I'd say NavSys looks like a prime candidate to use the gpsd-2 client library.
