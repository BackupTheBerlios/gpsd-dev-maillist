<PRE>Hi, I have a need for an enhanced udev utility which will get watch the 
input from generic serial to usb adaptors and decide if they are a gps 
or a modem.  If it's a GPS then we pass it to gpsd, if it's a modem then 
pass it somewhere else.  This is hopefully quite useful because at 
present gpsd snaffles any serial device

First up, would anyone be interested in working on this for a donation?

I think a solution could be done using a derivative of gpsctl, which 
already scans the serial port to guess the type of device.  If the 
scanning were enhanced to detect an AT compatible modem (ie send it an 
AT and see if it says OK back again) then largely much of the code is 
already done. 

I have done a little investigation into this and having only looked at 
the code for a few hours I have the following questions:

- I can see how driver_xyz.c works in big picture terms, but not really 
how to get a driver_at_modem.c started... Anyone want to start it off?
- At present there doesn't appear to be active baud rate setting for 
most of the drivers? This seems to lead to problems if the default baud 
does not allow us to communicate with the device? Can anyone comment on 
whether this is deliberate and the best way forward?
- What's the best way to have a driver which is there to be detected, 
but detected as a non gps? ie once we discover it's not a GPS we drop it 
and don't use it for input?

Grateful for any help

Thanks

Ed W
