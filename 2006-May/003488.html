<PRE>Analyze, dissect, refute.  This will become part of HACKING when
Berlios unjams itself enough to let me do checkins again.

** The buffering problem

Considered in the abstract, the cleanest thing for a
position/velocity/time oracle to return is a 14-tuple including
position components in all four dimensions, velocity in three, and
associated error estimates for all seven degrees of freedom.  This is
what the O message in GPSD protocol attempts to deliver.

If GPS hardware were ideally designed, we'd get exactly one report
like this per cycle from our device. That's what we get from SiRF-II
protocol (all PVT data is in packet type 02) and with the Zodiac
protocol (all PVT data is in the type 1000 packet).  These, together,
account for a share of the GPS market that is 80% and rising in 2006.

Unfortunately, many GPSes actually deliver their PVT reports as a
collection of sentences in NMEA 0183 (or as packets in a vendor binary
protocol less well designed than SiRF's) each of which is only a
partial report.  Here's the most important kind of incompleteness: for
historical reasons, NMEA splits 2-D position info and altitude into
two different messages (GGA and GPRMC or GLL), each issued once during
the normal 1-second send cycle.

*** Mapping the design space

For NMEA devices, then (and for devices speaking similary mal-designed
vendor binary protocols) accumulating a complete PVT thus requires
decisions about the following sorts of actions:

1. What data will be buffered, and for how long.

2. When the accumulated data will be shipped to the user 

3. When to invalidate some or all of the buffered data.

In thinking about these decisions, it's useful to consider the set of
events on which an action like &quot;merge new data into PVT buffer&quot; or
&quot;clear the PVT data buffer&quot; or &quot;ship report to user&quot; can trigger.

1. On receipt of any sentence or packet from the GPS.

2. On receipt of a specified sentence or packet from the GPS.

3. When the timestamp of a sentence or packet differs from the 
   last timestamp recorded.  

4. When some or all of the PVT data has not been refreshed for a
   specified number of seconds.

There are hundreds, even thousands of possible sets of action-to-event
bindings.  The &quot;right&quot; binding for a particular device depends not
only on the protocol it uses but on considerations like how much time
latency we are willing to let the buffering policy inflict on a
report.

**** Report then clear per packet

Sometimes the choices are simple.  It's pretty clear that a device
like a SiRF-II that reports all its PVT data in a single packet needs
no buffering; it should ship to the user on receipt of that packet and
then invalidate the PVT buffer right afterwards.  (This is a 
&quot;report then clear per packet&quot; policy.)

**** Buffer all, report then clear on trigger

On the other hand, if (say) we knew that an NMEA GPS were always going
to end its report cycle with GPGGA, it might make sense to buffer 
all data until GPGGA appears, ship a report afterwards, and then
clear the PVT buffer.  This would mean shipping just one report 
per cycle (good) at the cost of introducing some latency into the
reporting of data the GPS sends earlier in the cycle (bad).  (This
would be &quot;buffer all, report-then-clear on trigger&quot;)

Here's where it gets ugly.  We don't know what the user's tolerance
for latency is.  And, in general, we can't tell when end-of-cycle, is
happening, because different NMEA devices ship their sentences in
different orders.  Worse: we can't even count on all send cycles of
the same device having the same end sentence, so the naive plan of
waiting one cycle to see what the end sentence is won't work. Devices
like the Garmin 48 have two different cycle sequences with different
start and end sentences.

So we can't actually trigger on end-of-cycle.  The only between-cycles
transition we can spot more or less reliably is actually *start* of
cycle, by looking to see when the timestamp of a sentence or packet
differs from the last timestamp recorded (event 3 above).  This will
be after the last end-of-cycle by some (possibly large) fraction of a
second; in fact, waiting for start-of-cycle to report data from the
last one is the worst possible latency hit.

**** Buffer all, report on every packet, clear at start-of-cycle

Another possible policy is &quot;buffer all, report on every packet, clear
at start-of-cycle&quot;.  This is simple and adds minimum reporting
latency to new data, but means that O responses can issue more than once per
second with accumulating sets of data that only sum up to a complete
report on the last one.  

Another advantage of this policy is that when applied to a device like 
a SiRF-II or Zodiac chipset that ships only one PVT packet per cycle,
it collapses to &quot;report then clear per packet&quot;.

Here's a disadvantage: the client display, unless its does its own
buffering, may flicker annoyingly.  The problem is this: suppose we
get an altitude in a GGA packet, throw an O response at the client,
and display it.  This happens to be late in the report cycle.  Start
of cycle clears the buffer; a GPRMC arrives with no altitude in it.
The altitude value in the client display flickers to &quot;not available&quot;,
and won't be restored until the following GGA.

This is the policy gpsd currently follows.

**** Buffer all, report on every packet, never clear data

Has all the advantages of the previous policy and avoids the flicker 
problem.  However, it means the user will often see data that is up to one 
cycle time stale.   If the mode changes due to the device losing 
satellite lock, it will continue to report stale PVT data with
only the changed mode field to indicate that it's no longer good.

In the intermediate case where the device loses 3D lock but keeps
2D lock, altitude could go bad without any indication but the mode.

**** Buffer all, report on every packet, time out old data

gpsd does not presently keep the sort of per-field ageing data needed 
to track the age of different PVT fields separately.  But it does know
how many seconds have elapsed since the last packet receipt -- it uses
this to tell if the device has dropped offline, by looking for an age
greater than the cycle time.

When the device is returning fixes steadily, this policy will look
exactly like &quot;buffer all, report on every packet, never clear data&quot;,
because every piece of data will be refreshed once per cycle.  If
the device loses lock, the user will see that the PVT data is 
undefined only when the timeout expires.

Fine-grained timeouts using per-field aging wouldn't change this 
picture much.  They'd mainly be useful for matching the timeout 
on a piece of data to its &quot;natural&quot; lifetime -- usually 1 sec for
PVT data and 5 sec for satellite-picture data.

*** There is no perfect option

Any potential data-management policy would have drawbacks for some
devices even if it were implemented perfectly.  The more complex
policies would have an additional problem; buffering code with
complicated flush triggers is notoriously prone to grow bugs near its
edge cases.

Thus, gpsd has a serious, gnarly data-management problem at its core.
This problem lurks behind many user bug reports and motivates some of
the most difficult-to-understand code in the daemon.  And when you
look hard at the problems posed by the variable sequences of sentences
in NMEA devices...it gets even nastier.

It's tempting to think that, if we knew the device type in advance, 
we could write a state machine adapted to its sentence sequence that
would do a perfect job of data management.  The trouble with this
theory is that we'd need separate state machines for each NMEA
dialect.  That way lies madness -- and an inability to cope gracefully
with devices never seen before.  Since the zero-configuration design 
goal means that we can't count on the user or administrator passing 
device-type information to gpsd in the first place, we avoid this trap.

But that means gpsd has to adapt to what it sees coming down the wire.
At least it can use a different policy for each device driver,
dispatching once the device type has been identified.
