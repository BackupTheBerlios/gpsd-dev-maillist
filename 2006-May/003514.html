OK, I sort of expected that reply, but needed to be certain. :^)

For basic position (et al) reporting, I completely agree. It's the 
ancillary/obscure/extra functionality where I thought it might be easier 
(albeit uglier and less consistent) to make that be an exception. I'll be 
first to admit that that might not be the wisest course of action (and 
judging by your unambiguous reply, it's clearly not! :^} )

&gt;<i> Encouraging or even allowing applications to send NMEA to devices breaks

I would not disagree. I just wanted/needed to get the ground rules down.

&gt;<i> -- but judicious and 
</I>&gt;<i> carefully-thought-out extensions of the command set might be.  The NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> string to be sent is in each case driver-specific knowledge embedded in
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd itself.
</I>
OK, sounds logical.

But let me work through a couple examples. If a client application wants the 
&quot;leap second&quot; count, how should this work? Client sends newly-defined command 
('h' or 'j' -- there's nothing else left!) which means 'report leap seconds'. 
'gpsd' realizes that the NMEA sentence to get that information ('$PGRMF' in 
this case) is not enabled. Does it enable it permanently? Temporarily? Then 
'gpsd' reports the information to the client.  So far, not too bad.

But it gets a bit stickier.... Now the client wants GPS (internal) temperature 
('$PGRMT'). But '$PGRMT' is a once-per-minute (not per-second!) NMEA 
sentence. Hmmmm.... things are a bit more complicated now. Realistically, the 
appropriate NMEA sentence would have to already have been enabled before the 
query is initiated. But how do we do that? We'd probably need a 'gpsd-ified' 
command to enable the proper GPS output and another for the query. Is this 
practical? I'm not sure, but I'm starting to think &quot;maybe not&quot;.
