Agreed.

But that was my point, adding half a feature is not right.  Until cpgs
and xgps can show the data it is impossible to really validate it.

&gt;<i> &gt;   Then you have all the third party apps, like gpsdrive that can

</I>
Yes it should have it added, but for people using gpsdrive with all fours
wheels solidly on the ground the heading and track are the same.  So
moving track to heading for them is a fatal change.

&gt;<i> &gt;  We can discuss this all we want but real users with

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. :)  All of this has been written from the point of view of &quot;what would

</I>&gt;<i> GPS use is in the air, I'd want a rock-solid distinction between heading and
</I>&gt;<i> track.
</I>
Well until you buy an etrex you are not a real user.  NASA programmers
assert that as hard as they try, half the bugs are still found in field
tests.  Integrity can cut many ways, adding code witout being able to test
it can also imply a false integity.
