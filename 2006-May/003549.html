<PRE>&gt;<i>t=0.0: GPS begins to transmit data
</I>&gt;<i>t=0.a: GPSd receives all data for current cycle
</I>&gt;<i>		and sends current fix to client, client records 
</I>&gt;<i>system time of fix
</I>
Actually, it doesn't work like that.  GPSd passes on data (in raw or 
watcher mode) as soon as a given sentence is received.  About the 
only exceptions are messages which take more than one sentence to 
deliver (e.g. GSV), and those are not generally timestamped... but 
RMC and GGA and other single-sentence messages cause GPSd to parse 
and immediately pass on the information to all raw and watcher mode 
clients.  So the only lag you have is between the GPS unit computing 
the fix and sending the sentence with that fix data to GPSd, which 
has nothing to do with the time taken to receive a &quot;complete&quot; cycle.

If you really wanted to be paranoid, your GPS client thread could 
measure the computer-clock delay between the first sentence with a 
the latest timestamp and the most recent sentence with the same 
timestamp, so you could use the most recent message and still remove 
the majority of the delay since the GPS unit calculated the fix it is 
reporting.  That still all goes quite comfortably in the client side, 
with only the gap between calculation of fix and receipt of *first* 
sentence from that fix to worry about.  At all realistic speeds, that 
gap will account for an error smaller than typical GPS uncertainty 
(at cruise speed in a Piper Chieftain, allowing for a fairly huge 0.1 
second delay to receipt of the first sentence, that's still an error 
of only 9 metres).
