</I>
Unfortunately, looking back, I realize that I didn't explain very well in my 
initial email on this topic (back in early April) what I was really thinking. 

First, it's true that 'gpsd' doesn't currently have the facilities (other than 
via initialization) to send a command to the GPS receiver. But... will that 
always be the case? If so, there's probably no point in discussing this 
further.

Personally, I think the answer depends on how people see 'gpsd'. Is it a 
bare-bones, &quot;assimilate just the essential position data&quot; sort of 
application, or could it become something more for the GPS receivers (and 
other hardware) that are more capable than the basic hardware packaged with 
your typical Windows mapping software? I'd like to think the latter, but I'm 
willing to live with the former. :^)

As it is today, the two big advantages of 'gpsd' (IMHO) are (1) the capability 
to deal with a wide variety of hardware and (2) the ability to effectively 
share a single device among multiple client applications.

The disadvantage of 'gpsd' is that it provides just the basic position data, 
forcing me to forego any of the advanced features of the more-capable GPS 
receivers (e.g. leap second reporting, GPS receiver internal temperature 
reporting, etc).

Before even considering discussion about possibly dealing with a changing NMEA 
datastream, it makes sense to decide if 'gpsd' will ever support host-to-GPS 
commands at all.

I think we all agree that sending commands &quot;behind gpsd's back&quot; is not 
supported. But I'm talking about sending commands _through_ gpsd, not behind 
its back. Sorry I didn't make that clear initially.

P.S. I don't think any of this discussion should hold up Robin's 
improvements/patch. But I do believe that this issue is better discussed now 
than later, given the whole buffering (re-)design issue/discussion.

Regards,
Bill Marr
