<PRE>&gt;<i> If the GPS is on a car flying down
</I>&gt;<i> the highway, the 1 second delay in the buffered data can represent a
</I>&gt;<i> 35 meter error in the position at the time of the event. So instead
</I>&gt;<i> of just buffering, would it make sense to interpolate the data to
</I>&gt;<i> provide an answer for the time that the client query is received.
</I>
I think this kind of reasoning is exactly why there has been so much
reluctance in implementing buffering.  Buffering would make it easy to
retrieve the data you want at the time you want it, but the data would
not necessarily be valid for that moment.  I.e. it makes life easier for
applications that just want to display a position indicator, and harder
for perfectonists that look at issues like the above.

&gt;<i> You might say that the client should interpolate the data itself. But
</I>&gt;<i> can it? In order for the client to interpolate the data it needs to
</I>&gt;<i> know the offset between it's time reference and the GPS time. If all
</I>&gt;<i> of it's queries are buffered there is always a 1 second jitter in the
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>
The data received from gpsd includes a timestamp that indicates the time
at which it was taken.  This should of course remain.  It can be used to
know or calculate the position at a certain moment, but maybe you can
calculate it only a few seconds later.

Of course anyone who is interested in this amount of detail has already
setup gpsd and ntpd to synchronize the system clock with GPS time.
