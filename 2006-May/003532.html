An interesting twist in my own personal consideration of this 
question just occurred: see, the reason I found this bug in the first 
place is that I was testing other bug-fixes using two clients with 
different query methods side-by-side (cgps, which uses watcher mode, 
and gps2ge, which uses a compound query), and observed a discrepancy 
in the mode they were returning (cgps went from &quot;NO FIX&quot; straight to 
&quot;3D Fix&quot;, while gps2ge was aware of 2D fixes).  What makes that 
interesting is that - for gps2ge - I thought I'd decided to run with 
altitude reported by the gps even in a 2D fix... but, I hadn't.  In 
fact, because I use a compound query in that program (rather than a 
single O query), it wouldn't have been possible anyway.  Why?

Because &quot;A&quot; *already* only returns the altitude if mode==3D.

Now here's where it gets interesting, at least as far as I'm 
concerned: I quite agree with my own arguments as to why an O report 
should include any altitude the GPS unit is reporting, along with the 
mode, so that users can make their own decision as to whether to use 
a calculated estimate of altitude (although I'm prepared to concede 
this point if it is shown that altitude in a 2D fix is &quot;completely 
random garbage&quot;).  However, I don't believe we can do the same thing 
with the A query - since a client could send an A query in isolation, 
we can't respond to that with anything other than ? unless the mode 
is 3D, since otherwise the client may have no way of knowing that the 
reliability of that response has lowered.

As far as I can see, this makes the question more complicated because 
individual value queries give us no way of ensuring the user is aware 
of a problem with the quality of the data, so we can only pass the 
data on if gpsd is sufficiently assured that it is correct.  This 
means we need to do better status handling so as not to return DR'd 
positions to P queries (there is currently no status-based logic to 
prevent this, although that depends whether the GPS unit could be 
counted on to return MODE_NO_FIX if in DR mode; I have done no 
testing to see if that is the case for my device... although I have 
watched KisMAC continue to follow a straight line on the map when 
I've turned a corner under a tunnel or bridge, so the circumstantial 
evidence says that either my GPS gave no indication that it was 
DR'ing, or that gpsd passed the P values on anyway).

However, I also think the ideal result of using O queries or watcher 
mode along with libgps should be that the gps.fix structure in the 
client contains the same data as the gpsdata.fix structure in the 
running gpsd... and the only way to achieve that is to accept my 
proposed patch to add mode to the O query response.

So... what do others think?

1) should individual queries such as P and A be filtered so that we 
only return data that comes from a real GPS fix in that dimension?
	-&gt; leave A as is, but add a filter so that P=? when in DR mode

2) should the aim of using O/W with libgps be to put data into 
gps.fix that resembles as closely as possible the data in gpsdata.fix?

3) should an O query aim to mimic a compound query (TPAV...) but 
without the delimiters?

The possible answers to that are &quot;yes&quot; to: 1+2; 2+3, 1+3.  1+2+3 is 
not an option.

- At the moment, we have 1 (needs work) plus 3 (needs work).
- My patched version gives 1 (needs work) plus 2 (pretty close).

1+2: I think as an overall system design, 1+2 provides greater 
flexibility and leads more to the behaviour I would expect, 
particularly in regards to libgps, while still being suitably 
paranoid for individual query-based clients.  This is my preference.

1+3: If, however, GPS altitude returned in a 2D fix is shown to be 
&quot;completely random garbage&quot; rather than &quot;calculated estimate&quot;, I'm 
prepared to accept that we don't really lose anything with 1+3.

2+3: This seems irresponsible towards individual query-based clients 
(since it would require us to return values for P and A if we have 
them, even if there's some question about their validity, and the 
client may not ask for the accompanying field that would allow them 
to be aware of that uncertainty). I would be inclined to avoid this 
option.

Thoughts?
