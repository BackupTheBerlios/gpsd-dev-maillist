This is - in a nutshell - the reason why I think we should continue 
to allow gpsd to report GPS-reported altitude and mode (and 
therefore, to add mode to the O output).  It is a user decision to 
use or ignore &quot;estimated&quot; data... we just have to be sure that gpsd 
(and by extension, the libgps/gpsd combination) provide the complete 
information needed to make such a decision.

Here's one possible scenario: your GPS uses a combination of the 
currently received signals and recent trends to determine altitude. 
You've been in a steady descent for a minute or two before the 
receiver gets unlucky with satellite geometry and loses assurance of 
accurate 3D positioning, therefore dropping to a 2D fix mode.  Since 
the recent 500 foot-per-minute descent rate trend still approximately 
agrees with its best signal-based estimate for position, it continues 
to report that estimated altitude along with the 2D fix mode. 
Ignoring lat and long (since we're not currently discussing whether 
to invalidate position when the receiver goes DR), here's a sequence 
of what the GPS might report:

15000', 3D
14500', 3D
14000', 2D
13500', 2D
13000', 3D

We have a choice between gpsd/libgps reporting what's shown above 
(and what has come from the GPS), or making a veto and returning the 
following:

15000', 3D
14500', 3D
NaN, 2D
NaN, 2D
13000', 3D

The first gives the client flexibility: I can choose whether my 
client program (if it uses altitude at all) will accept altitude from 
a 2D fix mode, or will behave more conservatively and ignore it, or 
(potentially) use last 3D-fixed altitude data (this is generally 
going to be less accurate than a calculated estimate, but might still 
be used since altitude typically changes very slowly compared to 
other parameters).  The second gives me no flexibility: I am forced 
to take gpsd's conservative approach, whether that's the decision I 
would have made or not.

Now here's the kicker: for non-critical applications (i.e. the fun 
stuff), I'll almost always take the first approach: accept 
GPS-reported altitude from a 2D fix, but make some indication that 
we're in 2D mode.  If that is not an option because gpsd has made the 
executive decision that I shouldn't be allowed to have that 
information, gpsd becomes less useful.
