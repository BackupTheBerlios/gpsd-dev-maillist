First response: nice job!  If I hadn't turned blue holding my breath 
for it, I'd say it was worth the wait... and in fact, it still was. :)

For the most part, I'd say it covers the bases quite comprehensively. 
However, there are a couple of bits I'd like to dissect, and one 
important set of drawbacks that I'd like to refute.

&gt;<i>2. When the accumulated data will be shipped to the user
</I>
This is indeed an important part of the design of gpsd, and must be 
considered, but it is not the only way gpsd operates: the above 
question applies to the &quot;push&quot; model of data transfer, as you get 
when a client is in watcher (W) mode.  However, gpsd is equally 
capable of using a &quot;pull&quot; model, sending responses on demand to 
client queries such as &quot;P&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;O&quot; etc.  In this context, the 
question of when data is shipped to the user is not for us to 
determine: quite simply, data is shipped to the user *when the user 
asks for it*.

Ironically, taking this extra consideration into account very much 
simplifies our overall decision-making process, because point 2 above 
is not actually up to us... and as a result, any &quot;report then clear&quot; 
model is impractical, as we never know when a client might ask for a 
response (consider the case of two simultaneously connected clients, 
one sending queries and the other in watcher mode - if we clear after 
we ship the O message to the watcher, then the other client queries, 
it gets nothing in response).  So, some of the options below 
disappear immediately.  That does, however, mean that point 3 is THE 
question.

&gt;<i>3. When to invalidate some or all of the buffered data.
</I>
I believe I have a good answer to this, but I'll cover that in my 
attempted &quot;refute&quot;, below.

&gt;<i>**** Report then clear per packet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>**** Buffer all, report then clear on trigger
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As discussed above, neither of these is a practical option for a 
client-pull situation.

&gt;<i>**** Buffer all, report on every packet, clear at start-of-cycle
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Here's a disadvantage: the client display, unless its does its own
</I>&gt;<i>buffering, may flicker annoyingly.  The problem is this: suppose we
</I>&gt;<i>get an altitude in a GGA packet, throw an O response at the client,
</I>&gt;<i>and display it.  This happens to be late in the report cycle.  Start
</I>&gt;<i>of cycle clears the buffer; a GPRMC arrives with no altitude in it.
</I>&gt;<i>The altitude value in the client display flickers to &quot;not available&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>and won't be restored until the following GGA.
</I>
Not only is this a problem for watcher mode clients, but it can be a 
much greater problem for query-based clients: clients in watcher mode 
can at least buffer based on a semi-predictable sequence of 
loss-then-reappearance of valid data, but for a query-based client, 
the completeness of the response is effectively totally random.  It 
is for that reason that I believe the current approach is not 
acceptable, *however* I think the choice becomes easier if I can 
refute the concerns raised below... and I'm pretty certain I can.

&gt;<i>**** Buffer all, report on every packet, never clear data
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Has all the advantages of the previous policy and avoids the flicker
</I>&gt;<i>problem.  However, it means the user will often see data that is up to one
</I>&gt;<i>cycle time stale.   If the mode changes due to the device losing
</I>&gt;<i>satellite lock, it will continue to report stale PVT data with
</I>&gt;<i>only the changed mode field to indicate that it's no longer good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In the intermediate case where the device loses 3D lock but keeps
</I>&gt;<i>2D lock, altitude could go bad without any indication but the mode.
</I>
I'll try to refute the concerns here as comprehensively as possible, 
while keeping this reasonably concise (ok, I failed).  I realise that 
many (most?) of the developers here have SiRF-II or other binary 
devices, and therefore don't encounter old-school NMEA data any more, 
so allow me to review the actual behaviour of what appears to be a 
fairly typical NMEA device (I know, &quot;there's no such thing&quot;... but 
the general principles should still hold).

The Holux GM-210 sends the following set of sentences (in some order 
- not necessarily the same order) every cycle, even when it has no 
fix:

$GPGSA
$GPGSV (as many as required, every fifth cycle)
$GPRMC
$PGRME

When it gets a fix, it adds a $GPGGA sentence to the beginning of 
each cycle.  Here's typical output with no fix (in this case, after 
losing a fix due to limited sky view):

$GPRMC,163841,V,2024.1085,S,11835.9502,E,0.0000,-0.000,180506,,*01
$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*32
$PGRME,400.00,0.00,0.00*7B
[GSV sentences snipped]
$GPRMC,163842,V,2024.1085,S,11835.9502,E,0.0000,-0.000,180506,,*02

compare the following just before it lost the fix (2D fix - marginal sky view):

$GPGGA,163825,2024.1090,S,11835.9490,E,2,03,12.40,-130.7,M,-0.249,M,,*6F
$GPRMC,163825,A,2024.1090,S,11835.9490,E,0.0000,-0.000,180506,,*1A
$GPGSA,A,2,20,11,01,,,,,,,,,,0.0,12.4,0.0*07
$PGRME,99.20,0.00,0.00*4D
$GPGGA,163826,2024.1085,S,11835.9502,E,2,03,12.40,-130.7,M,-0.249,M,,*62

The above data illustrates two important points:

1) although the GGA sentence has disappeared when the fix was lost, 
the RMC sentence was still sent every cycle, and explicitly 
invalidates position, speed and track.  Furthermore, it sets status 
to V (void), so we know the GPS has lost its fix.  When such a 
sentence is received, gpsd already sets fix.mode to MODE_NO_FIX, and 
therefore returns ? for all PVT data.  We immediately stop sending 
any remaining obsolete data (i.e. altitude), although it hasn't 
explicitly been removed from the buffer, and we won't send any PVT 
data until the GPS reports a valid fix again.  When the GPS reports a 
valid fix, we receive a GGA sentence, and the old altitude will be 
overwritten.

2) the GGA sentence reports altitude along with a 2D fix.  This is 
crucial to understand: a GPS may well report an altitude of which it 
is not sure (i.e. it knows its latitude and longitude accurately, but 
is using DR calculations for altitude - this is because triangulation 
of altitude requires more and/or better signals than triangulation of 
latitude and longitude).  When this happens, the GPS reports an 
altitude and reports a mode of &quot;2D fix&quot; along with it.  As such, the 
only way to be faithful to what the GPS unit itself reports is to 
pass on both the altitude and the fix mode to clients.  It is for 
exactly this reason that I've submitted the &quot;O-mode&quot; patch for 
consideration: because altitude data without the true GPS-reported 
mode can never be assumed to be correct.  On the other hand, that 
means it isn't our job to invalidate altitude if the fix mode drops 
to 2D: the GPS reports it, and so should we.

The mention of 3D vs 2D in the context of the &quot;never clear&quot; option is 
slightly misleading: the current logic of clearing all fix data at 
the start of a cycle does nothing to prevent passing on altitude from 
a 2D fix, so whether or not we like that happening actually has 
nothing to do with the proposed change from &quot;clear at start of cycle&quot; 
to &quot;never clear&quot;.

In summary, point by point:

* &quot;the user will often see data that is up to one cycle time stale&quot; - 
this is unavoidable with any client-pull arrangement, and hardly a 
significant liability for server-push.  Up-to-one-cycle-time-stale 
data is substantially preferable to reporting NaN for one or another 
value, seemingly at random.

* &quot;If the mode changes due to the device losing satellite lock, it 
will continue to report stale PVT data with only the changed mode 
field to indicate that it's no longer good.&quot; - not true.  When the 
fix is lost, the very next cycle invalidates the fix mode (i.e. sets 
MODE_NO_FIX), and gpsd stops sending PVT data.  Almost identical 
behaviour results from disconnection of the GPS mid-stream: the 
daemon realises it is no longer connected, and stops returning PVT 
data in response to queries.

* &quot;In the intermediate case where the device loses 3D lock but keeps 
2D lock, altitude could go bad without any indication but the mode.&quot; 
- this is no change from current behaviour, but is in fact the way it 
should be, since that is what the GPS sends.  It is up to the client 
to choose whether to use DR altitude data or not when the fix mode is 
MODE_2D_FIX, but it should be made available to them as long as the 
GPS continues to send it.  It is the responsibility of pull clients 
to request fix mode along with altitude (i.e. &quot;PAM\n&quot;, not &quot;PA\n&quot;), 
but we must include fix mode in the O response so that watcher mode 
clients receive the essential data, hence my O-mode patch (which has 
been posted to the list, as well as explained in detail off-list).

&gt;<i>**** Buffer all, report on every packet, time out old data
</I>
Since I believe the above deals with the concerns of the &quot;never 
clear&quot; approach, this seems unnecessarily complicated.  Unless 
someone messes with the unit directly behind gpsd's back while gpsd 
is running, the unit can be counted on to continue to send sentences 
which clear or invalidate old data... and we've already discussed 
what should happen to people silly enough to do that kind of messing 
around. :)

&gt;<i>*** There is no perfect option
</I>
Agreed - primarily because we can't, in reality, do any better than 
the data the GPS unit sends.

&gt;<i>This problem lurks behind many user bug reports and motivates some of
</I>&gt;<i>the most difficult-to-understand code in the daemon.
</I>
Actually, having waded through much of the input-handling/buffering 
code when dealing with earlier reported bugs, I have to say that I 
think the approach taken in gpsd is remarkably straight-forward and 
elegant.  By keeping one structure for newly received data and 
another for existing data, then setting flags to handle how the two 
will be combined, it seems to me that the daemon is very well placed 
to handle almost any form of input, regardless of how ancient or 
arcane the protocol.

Anyway, I believe I've made my case reasonably clear.  Unless there 
are further concerns not addressed above, the plaintiff rests.  In 
fact, since it's 1:40am, the plaintiff is going to rest anyway!

Cheers,
Robin
