t=-?: GPS computes the fix for the top of the next second
t=0.0: GPS begins to transmit data
t=0.a: GPSd receives all data for current cycle
		and sends current fix to client, client records system time of fix
t=x: Client receives event and records system time of event
		client computes delta (x - 0.a) to apply to fix from t=0.

This still leaves the uncorrected offset (0.a - 0.0) (which can be a  
significant fraction of a second). The only current way for the  
client to correct for this error is to know that NTPd is running and  
has synchronized the system clock to the GPS time. If the system  
clock is not synchronized, attempts by the client to correct the fix  
could lead to gross errors.

Since GPSd is already capable of computing the time of the start of  
cycle to pass to NTPd it would be almost trivial to offset query mode  
results to the time of the query. This isn't a significant  
modification of the results since it is exactly what the GPS did when  
it computed the fix for the future cycle. GPSd was already thoughtful  
enough to include the fractional second in the time results.
