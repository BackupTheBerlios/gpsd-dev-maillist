<PRE>All gps solutions are estimates of navigation parameters, just some
are more precise and/or more trustworthy than others.

Agreed. I think I might have said in IRC last week that I don't care
if the GPS gives me pure garbage, so long as the status isn't set to
&quot;valid&quot;. The gps can put whatever it likes in the altitude field, but
I won't look at it unless my fix is 3D or better.

&gt;<i> &gt; SiRF receivers use an altitude hold, either from the last good 3d fix

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, an altitude hold in the GPS is bad design.  That's a policy decision

</I>
Altitude hold, in some receivers, can be disabled. It's not
necessarily a bad design: the receiver is doing it's best to give you
some information, and if it's having to guess at your position, it
does admit that fact with the status flags: 2D, 3D, 3D-overdetermined,
3D-DGPS... if you don't like that, look at the flags and ignore the
fix until it's a real 3D fix.

Altitude hold may be necessary to allow the solver to work in 2D: all
the navigation is done in ECEF, and is then converted to LLA. If you
know time (you get that from having code lock) and have a good
estimate of your altitude, then you should be able to work towards a
reasonable 2D position estimate using an otherwise-insufficient number
of satellites.

For most (average joe) gps users, the big win is latitude and
longitude. I don't care if my destination is on the 100th floor of
this building - first I need to navigate to the front door. Altitude
isn't important.

The same criticism can be levelled at static navigation and smoothing...

&gt;<i> &gt; The navigation solver is capable of providing a 2d position estimate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either using the least squares method or the kalman filter.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the case that altitude is invalid coming out of the solver, the UI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (the part of the code that generates SiRF or NMEA messages) can delete
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that data, and set a flag that says &quot;there was garbage here, so i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cleaned this message up for you&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand the above. If it's &quot;2d position estimate&quot; how
</I>&gt;<i> is there an altitude to be valid or invalid?
</I>
It's an estimate because it's not a proper 3d solution.The gps is
playing some tricks to give you an estimate of where you are, at least
in terms of latitude and longitude. There is an altitude because it's
a necessary part of computing latitude and longitude - remember, your
position is first computed in ECEF and then is converted to LLA for
your convenience.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
