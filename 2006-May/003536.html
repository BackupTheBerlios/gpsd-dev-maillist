<PRE>Dear Sir/Madam,
 
My name is Daniel lakele Zuma,a relative to former vice president Jacob Zuma of South Africa. I got your email address from the web directory so I decided to contact you.
 
I  am interested in diverting some funds currently floating in the foreign suspense account of the federal pay office to your account as soon as possible.
 
Source of the funds are:
 
During the South Africa arms deal with French arms manufacturer, Thales, involvling Jacob Zuma and his adviser, Schabir Shaik, government&#146;s officials awarded contracts to their own companies, these contracts were grossly over invoiced. Now the present government set up review panel to investigate the contract. My cousin (Jacob Zuma) and I lodged a huge amount totaling US$120m (One hundred and Twenty million us dollars) in a bank in Europe.
 
I will want US$70.5m (Seventy million &amp; Five Hundred Thousand) united states dollars out of this money oversea transferred to your account because I'm not eligible to operate foreign account because of the present political situation involving my cousin Jacob Zuma, and I am searching for a partner abroad. I really want this transfer made as soon as possible before the government, who have started refunding money from our foreign accounts track this money. I will be offering 30% for your assistance.
If you would want to proceed with this transaction please reply with your full name and telephone number and if you do not accept my offer please treat with utmost confidentiality.
 
For more information check and browse carefully all the links in the website below.

Best Regards,
Daniel Lakele Zuma,
