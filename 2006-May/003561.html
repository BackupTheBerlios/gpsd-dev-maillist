I actually ended up ordering the RTCM 2.3 and 3.0 specs. The different
2.x versions are backwards compatible, but 3.0 is an entirely different
protocol. If I have time, I'll try to add support for any new messages
defined in 2.2 and 2.3. Same goes for adding support for 3.0.

</I>&gt;<i> newer RTCM versions.
</I>
The one good feature in Ntrip is that it doesn't make any assumptions
about the nature of the carried payload data. It is therefore not
limited to just RTCM format correction data, but can just as well
deliver WAAS/EGNOS and any other available correction data.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adding NTRIP support sounds like a good idea from the point of getting

</I>&gt;<i> are playing it clean and are not trying to patent the protocol or

</I>&gt;<i> difficult.)
</I>
Well, they have provided both C and Perl reference implementations of
the Ntrip client and server for free under the GPL. The Ntrip
broadcaster based on Icecast, is also available under GPL, but you have
to pay 500 EUR for a copy :-( Too bad no licensee has redistributed the
source code; if someone had, I would have fixed a clear bug in it.

As for the the protocol, although not freely available in its entirety,
it is based on open IETF standards. So, also remembering your prior art
work on dgps-ip, I really don't see anything patentable in the Ntrip
protocol, but then again IANAL ;-)

Ville
