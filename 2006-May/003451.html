<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> With &quot;buffering&quot;, one could collect all data from a single fix (sent in
</I>&gt;<i> multiple messages from the receiver) in a single unit, and present it to
</I>&gt;<i> the clients (or make available for polling) as a consistent set.  So
</I>&gt;<i> position, velocity, error information etc all comes from a single fix.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it would be better called &quot;double buffering&quot; as there is one buffer
</I>&gt;<i> that holds a valid dataset for the clients, and one that is collecting the
</I>&gt;<i> next dataset from the receiver messages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not the same as the buffer we have now, because that is updated
</I>&gt;<i> incrementally.  when it is not cleared at start of cycle it may hold a
</I>&gt;<i> position from one fix, and velocity from the previous fix, for example. 
</I>&gt;<i> (depending on the protocol in use, and the way it splits the data into
</I>&gt;<i> different message types)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned before, there are (at least) these issues with double buffering:
</I>&gt;<i> - it introduces a delay between what the receiver sends and what the
</I>&gt;<i> client sees
</I>&gt;<i> - it is difficult to know when you have collected all data the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> will send for this fix, especially when you want the abovementioned delay
</I>&gt;<i> to be small
</I>&gt;<i> - the cycletime may be different for each message type, so not all cycles
</I>&gt;<i> contain all data.  the decision whether to keep old data from previous
</I>&gt;<i> fixes needs to be made, including the issue of what to do when certain
</I>&gt;<i> data is no longer received (invalidate or keep last received value
</I>&gt;<i> forever).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A double-buffering mechanism in fact implemented in gpsd, but only between
</I>&gt;<i> the driver and the main fix buffer.  When gps_merge_fix is not called for
</I>&gt;<i> every message, and the message flags are somehow collected until the end
</I>&gt;<i> of the cycle, we would have the required buffer.  This is, however, not
</I>&gt;<i> easy to implement.
</I>
And Rob puts his finger unerringly on why the thought of adding more
buffering logic in the daemon frightens me.  &quot;Not easy&quot; is an 
understatement -- &quot;total revolving bitch that will spawn subtle 
timing-dependent bugs we'd be chasing for the next year&quot; would be 
more accurate.

I understand the demand for better buffering.  I just quail at the thought
of what it's going to do to our stability and bug rates while we're
getting it right.
