I have a PPS GPS.  So my local clock is always within a few micro
seconds of gps time. Yes that is .000003 seconds or better.  Then I set
the test GPS to also feed time to ntpd.  Then ntpd does all the rest of
the work for me.

Here is what I see right now:

As you can see, ignoring the shitty time.windows.com server, I am right
now within a few mS of 3 high stratum server.  SHM(1) is the PPS and
SHM(0) is the NMEA off a Garmin GPS 18 at 38kbps. ntpd claims my SHM(1)
is stable to -19 or -20.  SHM(1) is only stable to -1!  SHM(0) is after
a 500mS offset hard coded in to my ntpd.conf.  Depending on the TOD the
SHM(0) offset wanders around +/- 200mS.

And this is with a nice Garmin at high bps.  Imagine how bad it can be
at 4800 with an old GPS.


&gt;<i> I completely agree this is the best and most conservative way to treat GPS
</I>&gt;<i> information - my example was more to outline how, if GPSd could ever be
</I>&gt;<i> expected to extrapolate, there would be no valid reason not to do the
</I>&gt;<i> extrapolation in the client instead.
</I>
If pigs have enough thrust they could fly. RFC 1925, 2.(3)

Sadly this pig does not have enough thrust, at least not using NMEA over
a slow serial link.  If you want a better data rate then you can get a
5Hz Garmin for not much more than the basic one.

&gt;<i> (although I admit I'm surprised that the delay between fix and
</I>&gt;<i> sending-first-sentence-from-fix can be that huge... even 4800bps doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> account for that magnitude of delay).
</I>
I assume the pathetic CPU in that GPS had something to do with it.  They
decided not to spent more money on the CPU that was required to meet a
one second update rate.  My old (now dead) EC-10X had troubles with a
2 sec update rate.

&gt;<i> &gt; OTOH a friend of mine has his survey grade GPS mark his aerial film with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the raw GPS data as he takes the picture.  Then he postprocesses down to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; centimeters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wow... that's fairly impressive!  I'm assuming that's sort of linear
</I>&gt;<i> regression processing in multiple dimensions... or does he have PPS as well?
</I>&gt;<i> The ionospheric effect alone accounts for several metres uncertainty without
</I>&gt;<i> PPS.
</I>
He does not care about time, just location.  So the trick is to save the
raw GPS data (not the NMEA, the time code differences for each sat in
view).  Then post porocess the data against a set of locally determined
correction factors for the instant those measurements were taken.
