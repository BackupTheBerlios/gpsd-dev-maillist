It seams to me that there are two types of clients. The first type  
are the clients that want to do their own processing of the GPS data.  
These clients will most likely use the raw mode and therefore bypass  
the buffering.

The second type of client is attempting to document an event with a  
query asking &quot;Where am I NOW?&quot;. If the GPS is on a car flying down  
the highway, the 1 second delay in the buffered data can represent a  
35 meter error in the position at the time of the event. So instead  
of just buffering, would it make sense to interpolate the data to  
provide an answer for the time that the client query is received.

You might say that the client should interpolate the data itself. But  
can it? In order for the client to interpolate the data it needs to  
know the offset between it's time reference and the GPS time. If all  
of it's queries are buffered there is always a 1 second jitter in the  
time.
