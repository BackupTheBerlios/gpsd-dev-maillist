<PRE>&gt;<i>I have measured delays of 700mS with jitter over an hour of 500mS.
</I>
I understand how you've measured the jitter... but how did you 
measure the delay?  Not that I'm doubting you did: just that I don't 
quite see how you can figure out an underlying constant delay without 
first knowing the exact discrepancy between the sender's and 
receiver's clocks, or how you can calculate that discrepancy without 
first knowing the delay.  You see my puzzlement. :)

&gt;<i>   I
</I>&gt;<i>look at my GPS as telling me I was in the right place at the right time
</I>&gt;<i>in the past and not so much exactly where I am now.  As long as I am on
</I>&gt;<i>the proper glide path my exact position does not matter.  DH is what matters
</I>&gt;<i>and I get that from the &quot;sensitive altimeter&quot;.
</I>
I completely agree this is the best and most conservative way to 
treat GPS information - my example was more to outline how, if GPSd 
could ever be expected to extrapolate, there would be no valid reason 
not to do the extrapolation in the client instead.  It did not so 
much address the question of whether the possibility of extrapolation 
really existed in the first place (although I admit I'm surprised 
that the delay between fix and sending-first-sentence-from-fix can be 
that huge... even 4800bps doesn't account for that magnitude of 
delay).

&gt;<i>OTOH a friend of mine has his survey grade GPS mark his aerial film with
</I>&gt;<i>the raw GPS data as he takes the picture.  Then he postprocesses down to
</I>&gt;<i>centimeters.
</I>
Wow... that's fairly impressive!  I'm assuming that's sort of linear 
regression processing in multiple dimensions... or does he have PPS 
as well?  The ionospheric effect alone accounts for several metres 
uncertainty without PPS.
