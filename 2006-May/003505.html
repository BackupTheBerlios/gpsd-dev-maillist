<PRE>Copying to the dev list because people with experience of lots of devices
might help settle a factual question.

Robin L Darroch &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">robin at spade-men.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The only way to determine the validity of GPS information is to use 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the fix quality and mode indicators received from the GPS.  The fact 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that a GPS unit (and in turn, gpsd) offers information such as 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> position or altitude is no guarantee that that information has been 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> accurately determined as part of a 3-dimensional fix (DR mode is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> perfect example of this, as is the return of altitude information 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when only receiving a 2-D fix, as many GPS units will do). 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, if O and W are to provide complete information to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> client (as they clearly aim to do), the O command output must include 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mode along with P/V/T data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Can you think of any reason not to fix this at the server end, by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>forcing the altitude field to '?' if mode is not 3D?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This would have the same effect (client never sees invalid altitude data)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>without adding a new field.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand it, the aim of gpsd is to act as a &quot;neutral&quot; agent 
</I>&gt;<i> for the GPS device: if the GPS reports something, we pass that on to 
</I>&gt;<i> clients.  The GPS provides its best estimate of altitude when in 2D 
</I>&gt;<i> mode, just as it provides its best estimate of position when in DR 
</I>&gt;<i> mode.  To return ? for altitude if mode is not 3D means that we are 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;filtering&quot; the data from the GPS, and interfering with it before the 
</I>&gt;<i> client can see it.  We don't currently return ? for position when the 
</I>&gt;<i> GPS status indicates DR mode, so for consistency's sake we shouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> return ? for altitude when in 2D mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, for the purposes of clients using libgps, such filtering is 
</I>&gt;<i> undesirable: the ideal case would be for a libgps-based client using 
</I>&gt;<i> an O or W command to end up with the same thing in its gps.fix 
</I>&gt;<i> structure as the daemon itself has... and the more we add in this 
</I>&gt;<i> kind of logic, the less it behaves that way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a user of a GPS, I generally want as much information as it can 
</I>&gt;<i> provide: an estimated altitude along with the fact that it only has a 
</I>&gt;<i> 2D fix at this point in time is much more valuable to me than the 
</I>&gt;<i> altitude suddenly going blank.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The key distinction here is that altitude data in 2D mode is 
</I>&gt;<i> estimated, but not necessarily invalid.  Unless the GPS itself 
</I>&gt;<i> returns a null value for the altitude field, it isn't really for us 
</I>&gt;<i> to say that it is &quot;invalid&quot;.
</I>
This is the first I've heard of GPSes returning estimated altitudes 
when mode is 2D.  Having a nasty suspicious nature and some awareness
of the sorts of corners low-end units tend to cut, my reflex would be 
to treat altitude as garbage unless the GPS affirms it's valid.

Acting as a neutral agent is important, yes, but not passing the user
bad data is even more important.  Can anyone address these questions:

(a) What does NMEA 0183 say about this case?

(b) What do the GPSes of your experience actually do?
