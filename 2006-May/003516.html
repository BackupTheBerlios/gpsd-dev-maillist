<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;: 
&gt;<i> Altitude hold, in some receivers, can be disabled. It's not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily a bad design: the receiver is doing it's best to give you
</I>&gt;<i> some information, and if it's having to guess at your position, it
</I>&gt;<i> does admit that fact with the status flags: 2D, 3D, 3D-overdetermined,
</I>&gt;<i> 3D-DGPS... if you don't like that, look at the flags and ignore the
</I>&gt;<i> fix until it's a real 3D fix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Altitude hold may be necessary to allow the solver to work in 2D: all
</I>&gt;<i> the navigation is done in ECEF, and is then converted to LLA. If you
</I>&gt;<i> know time (you get that from having code lock) and have a good
</I>&gt;<i> estimate of your altitude, then you should be able to work towards a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable 2D position estimate using an otherwise-insufficient number
</I>&gt;<i> of satellites.

/me stares at cjk's screed for some time, then has Zen moment...

Ah, I see!  You're talking about two different *kinds* of altitude hold!

There's an invisible kind, where you latch altitude in order to keep
being able to deliver a 2D approximation of ECEF, and then there'a &quot;visible&quot;
kind in which you continue reporting altitude wile admitting you don't
have a 3D lock.

I'm not opposed to the invisible kind.  Given the trig, it's a
reasonable thing to do as long as you're admitting that fix quality is
degraded.  Them earth-to-GPS-orbit triangles are really tall and
skinny, so the situation where Z is changing fast enough to mess up
your 2D fix badly will be damn rare even in an airplane.  Er...actually, 
I think the only way it's ever likely to happen is a few seconds before 
you auger in...

On the other hand, I'm opposed to shipping a held altitude to the
client.  If the client app wants to kid itself that it has an accurate 
altitude on only a 2D lock, that's its policy choice -- but gpsd should not
encourage the delusion.
