OK - in that case, we need to get that user involved in this 
discussion.  The problem here is that it was wrong to begin with: it 
appears that when True North support was added, many things were not 
done correctly (for example, receiving a sentence from a True North 
device raises the fix mode to a minimum of 2D, when in fact we may 
have no idea at all where we are), simply for the sake of expediency. 
I know that virtually all software - gpsd included - comes with 
warnings and caveats and dire legal threats about never using it in a 
situation where you actually need it (thereby achieving the very 
important aim of keeping all of us off the hook, legally)... but I 
don't believe that should go so far as to say &quot;we know this is wrong, 
but someone who doesn't care it's wrong is using it already, so we 
shouldn't change it&quot;.

&gt;<i>Also of concern is how far the effects go.  This new heading addition
</I>&gt;<i>would also need to be made to libgps, cgps, xgps, the doc, etc.
</I>
Done - at least as far as libgps and the doc is concerned.  cgps and 
xgps don't need any changes, since they have no field that reports 
heading.  Indeed, most client software and most users won't care, BUT 
existing True North users SHOULD care, and should ensure that any 
client they wish to use distinguishes between track and heading.  The 
decision to equate the two must occur in the client, not in the 
server.

&gt;<i>   None
</I>&gt;<i>of which can be tested until we get someone with one of these units to
</I>&gt;<i>test it.
</I>
True - which is why this is posted to the dev list... and if no-one 
on the dev list has True North, then we need to involve such users.

&gt;<i>   Then you have all the third party apps, like gpsdrive that can
</I>&gt;<i>display track but know nothing of heading.
</I>
That doesn't mean we should program gpsd to lie: it means that if 
gpsdrive wants the benefit of using heading, it should have that 
facility added... otherwise, it can continue to use track data as it 
does for everyone who doesn't have a True North compass.

&gt;<i>   Maybe you can scrounge the
</I>&gt;<i>list archives and attempt to recontact a True North user and get them
</I>&gt;<i>involved first.
</I>
I'll see whom I can find.

&gt;<i>  We can discuss this all we want but real users with
</I>&gt;<i>real applications always seem to have their own views.
</I>
Indeed. :)  All of this has been written from the point of view of 
&quot;what would I want if I had a True North compass?&quot;... and the fact 
is, since much of my GPS use is in the air, I'd want a rock-solid 
distinction between heading and track.

&gt;<i>I do agree that something like this change needs to be done, but what
</I>&gt;<i>will really force it will be when someone has a GPS that reports track
</I>&gt;<i>and heading and needs both.  Then it needs to be done front to back.
</I>
True, that case would force it... but as long as we can get it right 
from a design point of view, and with the participation of the 
existing users, why leave it wrong until then?  We will always have 
to trade off simplicity and versatility against accuracy, but short 
of telling people &quot;if you want the right information, use raw mode&quot;, 
we should aim for our command suite to support as many realistic 
cases as it can, and certainly for it NOT to return values which are 
not the data that command is specified to return.

Anyhow, since I seem to be the Integrity Crusader at the moment 
(although hopefully not Robinson Crusoe), I'll see if I can find 
someone on the lists who has reported using True North devices, and 
discuss such testing with them off-list.

Cheers,
Robin
