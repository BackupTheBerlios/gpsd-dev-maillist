</I>
I'm not confused - my point is that you valued an opensource engine, but
that has not proved to be a useful facet in the case of Berlios...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me a reference?
</I>&gt;<i> I googled for &quot;github mailing lists&quot; and looked at the hits.  Of course,

OK, so your research was clearly exhaustive and detailed

You have obviously completely ignored my last email so I won't bother to
waste my time much further...

However, I will leave a tiny hint in case you are inclined to read what
should have been a helpful message: Berlios and Savannah both *host*
mailman mailing lists, however, it's really unimportant that the mailing
lists are *hosted* by the same provider as your source code control.  By
splitting the hosting you can allocate each to the &quot;best&quot; provider for
each. 

Picking a random large project as an example: Ruby on rails uses Github
for issue tracking (moved from Lighthouse - wow!), github for code,
unknown hosting for website and blog, freenode for irc and google groups
for mail (yeah yuck, but I just subscribe as per mailman and it works
exactly the same as mailman...)

You could easily use SF for code hosting, Savannah for mailing lists and
wordpress for the website... Experiment a little!


&gt;&gt;<i> It's closing in approximately 3 months right?  That's &quot;imminent&quot;, but I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think &quot;explosion&quot; is perhaps over egging things a touch?
</I>&gt;<i> No, you're just not thinking through the risks.  What do you suppose
</I>&gt;<i> would have happened if Berlios had had, say, a serious disk crash
</I>&gt;<i> before I could move the project?  We already know the organization was
</I>&gt;<i> dying and understaffed.  If you think there would have been any recovery
</I>&gt;<i> at all after such an incident, you're *far* more an optimist than I am.
</I>
Your argument is spurious.  If the project was gone due to a disk crash
then you have too much commitment to the hoster.  You simply can't trust
*anyone* this much.  Your project is not really any safer because it's
with Savannah - back it up externally if this is important to you!

&gt;<i> And all the site-dependent URLs on the website
</I>&gt;<i> are now templated in from the scons recipe.
</I>
Note also that domains are roughly $8/year - I don't know how you value
your time, but they can be a good investment to help minimising renaming
on change of hosting?  Would potentially be happy to pitch in the cost
for a cool domain?

Good luck
