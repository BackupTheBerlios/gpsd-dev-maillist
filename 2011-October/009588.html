What like Sourceforge?  (Which is the same software base as Savannah)

Which is more likely to sell your data - the guys who run the project as
a loss leader, relying on donations to keep the servers running and your
data safe, or the guys who take paid subscriptions to employ full time
people to do the same?  I confess I have no idea, but it's naive to
assume that one group is massively worse

Again I repeat: One of the key things is how easy it is to switch
somewhere else if you find you got baited.  Github currently makes it
really easy to pull ALL your data out and go somewhere else (including
issue tracking data).  If this changes then yes I would run a mile.  Is
it as simple to pull the data out of Savannha? It appears it wasn't to
get it out of Berlios...

All you gave is another failure mode for your hub.  All of these hubs
have some failure mode though.


&gt;<i> Having the project live at at open-source non-profit with the official
</I>&gt;<i> repo does not preclude anyone from setting up a copy of the repo on
</I>&gt;<i> github and using all the features they like.
</I>
Not *all* the features.  Many of the nicest features work because the
main code is on Github.  There is no point using a &quot;code blogging
system&quot; if the main copy of the code lives somewhere else...

&gt;<i> In my view, the real benefit of git is that anyone (with commit access
</I>&gt;<i> or not) can publish a repository that others can then examine and merge
</I>&gt;<i> commits from.
</I>
That's the benefit of *git*.  Anyone can setup a git repo with gitweb
and gitolite in a few mins

&gt;<i>   The details of where and github's feature of showing
</I>&gt;<i> related repos are relatively minor.
</I>
No, github goes well beyond that - if that's all you wanted then stick
with Gitorious (OSS hosting - not quite as slick as Github, but has some
traction)



&gt;<i> I find pushing github's network view feature to be contrary to git's
</I>&gt;<i> culture, as it changes back from a federated/distributed system to one
</I>&gt;<i> where there's a network effect to be on the same system; in that respect

</I>
You probably got quite close to it when you said, it's like facebook...

Not exactly like facebook, but the key thing is *cooperation*.  They
have a system which further lowers the borders between developers.  Just
simple stuff like: you commit a chunk of code, I can then comment on
*that chunk* and the comments are then permanently archived next to that
hunk so in years to come we can still see why decisions were made and
further commits made. 

Think of the improvements Git gives you over SVN - it's the ability to
take the code away with you, hack on it and bring the changes back and
merge them later.  The next evolution is to be able to track human
discussion about the code, right there in the code itself.  Think
instead of a traditional git system + bugzilla.  Now try and figure out
why some change was made in the code by searching through the mailing
list, bugzilla, commit log, etc.  What you really want is all those
things completely integrated... Perhaps some git add-on which lets you
add metadata to commits will emerge?  In the meantime the best I have
seen is github's web based system which ties all this stuff together
