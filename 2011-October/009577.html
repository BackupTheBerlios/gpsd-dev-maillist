<PRE>By all means reject it, but, I would challenge a few of your arguments
raised below:


&gt;<i> Kind of late - I moved us to Savannah days ago.  I did consider github, 
</I>&gt;<i> but rejected the idea for various reasons, including:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. the github engine is proprietary.
</I>
Seems irrelevant, counter arguments are either:

a) So was Berlios and how much good did that do you (is berlios opensource?)
b) Neither was Berlios and that didn't stop the project moving there
previously...

Sensible arguments are those against sites where the data is *locked up*
(facebook, etc), but I think that most of the main features of github
are implemented using git itself and hence extracting the data is just a
&quot;git clone&quot; away?

&gt;<i> 2. IIRC, github uses Google Groups for mailing lists.  Google Groups *sucks*;
</I>&gt;<i> having to log in to read mail is bogus.
</I>
I wasn't aware that Github has any mailing lists at all?  Can you send
me a reference?

Personally I don't massively like Google Groups, but some folks might
not be aware that you can use it just like MailMan without a gmail
account?  The features are just undocumented...


&gt;<i> 3. When you're driving as possible to get out of the blast radius
</I>&gt;<i> of an explosion, that is no time to buy a fancy new car.
</I>
It's closing in approximately 3 months right?  That's &quot;imminent&quot;, but I
think &quot;explosion&quot; is perhaps over egging things a touch?

I think you have enough time between now and the end of 2011 to give
some thought as to how to conduct an orderly transition?

&gt;<i> I'm open to argument that we should migrate to a fundamentally
</I>&gt;<i> different kind of forge - possibly github - at our leisure, but we
</I>&gt;<i> didn't need the process friction of doing that at the same time as
</I>&gt;<i> getting the project out of danger.  The move was hairy enough as
</I>&gt;<i> it was - cost me four days of hard work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Savannah has the virtue of being a lot like Berlios, only with less suck.
</I>&gt;<i> That's what we needed, this time - a safe place to land.
</I>
Taking a step back, you first need to decide what you really want out of
one of these sites before you can properly plump for one.  There are a
bunch of reasonable options out there, although several support only one
type of VCS, so that can rule them out if you don't want to change
source code system (which I think is probably a given in this case!)

The way I see the various options is that

- you have a clear winner in the &quot;I'm a programmer&quot;, &quot;I use Git&quot;
intersection and that's GitHub.  It's strength is it's a good solution
for coders because the front page is basically your code and you can get
stuck in rapidly from there.  It's programmer focused, eg you can
&quot;subscribe&quot; to the code, blog about the code, comment on the code, fork
the code privately and edit it, etc, etc

- On the flip side, github is a kind of &quot;code blogging system&quot; and
whilst that's great for programmers, its not necessarily the best choice
for all projects.  Github (and largely true of Gitorious) is only ok to
moderate at documentation (you get a wiki/website), it's (IMHO) weak at
issue tracking and release management and it has no mailing lists that I
know of.

- Sourceforge/Berlios/Savannah I personally loathe with a passion
because they are all (IMHO) clunky, ugly, slow as hell, extremely hard
to navigate and so technical/geeky looking as to make Github look
attractive...  At least several of them can be customised to show your
own web pages as the default project pages, which kind of gives you some
escape, but eventually you need to show the users the hub pages and you
are undone (I will concede that the current gpsd site hides the berlios
engine almost completely, it's a good example of escaping from the
underlying engine...!)

- Your other main option is a self hosted system, possibly using an
opensource management system, eg Redmine/Gitorious, etc.  This seems
unfashionable unless you happen to have the resources available and
prior experience, but the point is it's an option


- The final &quot;option&quot; is the easiest to overlook and that is that you
bond together your own structure from the individual best of breed
pieces... Eg right now you appear to mainly have a) a website (that
hides the underlying source code control, etc), b) Sourcecode control
(easy to outsource and only programmers care, so no problem to jump to
another site for code), c) mailing lists (again can be outsourced).  I
don't believe you currently use automated issue tracking, but again it
can be outsourced to a &quot;best of breed&quot; location if desired


My suggestion is that you have such straightforward requirements
(website, git repo, mailing list...) that you just pick the best
locations for each and use the website to pull the pieces together... 
Consider github for code.  Dunno about mailing lists. Github can also
host your website (it has a &quot;whole site hosting&quot; mode - see
<A HREF="http://pages.github.com/">http://pages.github.com/</A> ).  Other options of course also possible


Cheers
