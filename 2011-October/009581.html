<PRE>Ed W &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">lists at wildgooses.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I'm not confused - my point is that you valued an opensource engine, but
</I>&gt;<i> that has not proved to be a useful facet in the case of Berlios...
</I>
I'm not under any illusion that open source is magic pixie dust.  But
closed-source has additioinal failure modes I want no part of.

&gt;<i> You could easily use SF for code hosting, Savannah for mailing lists and
</I>&gt;<i> wordpress for the website... Experiment a little!
</I>
Nope, not under these circumstances.  You, having relatively little 
at stake, can be cavalier about the risks.  I have more weight on me.

&gt;<i> &gt; No, you're just not thinking through the risks.  What do you suppose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have happened if Berlios had had, say, a serious disk crash
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before I could move the project?  We already know the organization was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dying and understaffed.  If you think there would have been any recovery
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at all after such an incident, you're *far* more an optimist than I am.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your argument is spurious.  If the project was gone due to a disk crash
</I>&gt;<i> then you have too much commitment to the hoster.  You simply can't trust
</I>&gt;<i> *anyone* this much.  Your project is not really any safer because it's
</I>&gt;<i> with Savannah - back it up externally if this is important to you!
</I>
In principle, I agree. In practice, there's a substantial difference between
the risk profile of Savannah and Berlios. And backing up a forge site's 
instance of a project externally is quite difficult - I've actually written 
tools to do large part of it, so I understand this problem in detail.

&gt;<i> &gt; And all the site-dependent URLs on the website
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are now templated in from the scons recipe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note also that domains are roughly $8/year - I don't know how you value
</I>&gt;<i> your time, but they can be a good investment to help minimising renaming
</I>&gt;<i> on change of hosting?  Would potentially be happy to pitch in the cost
</I>&gt;<i> for a cool domain?
</I>
I am in fact looking into this, as the notice page on Berlios says.  Now
if I can just get my regitrar to explain why there was &quot;trouble processing my 
order&quot;...

I'd specify the domain, but I don't want there to be even an outside
chance that a squatter will grab it.
