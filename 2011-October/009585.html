Your reply shows that you haven't really looked deeply into what github
offer with their wrapper.  Ignoring end users for a moment and focusing
on *coders*, it's an absolutely marvelous system.  Just play with it for
a few minutes:

- Much nicer interface than gitweb:
<A HREF="https://github.com/rails/rails/commits/master">https://github.com/rails/rails/commits/master</A>

- Users can comment on and augment specific commits:
<A HREF="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ee2be435b1e5c0e94a4ee93a1a310e0471a77d07">https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ee2be435b1e5c0e94a4ee93a1a310e0471a77d07</A>

- Integrates directly with their own issue tracking system
   
<A HREF="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5711a35ad8faa3fb6d138b234cbe9acfad27a9a8">https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5711a35ad8faa3fb6d138b234cbe9acfad27a9a8</A>
    <A HREF="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2980">https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2980</A>

- Issue got a lot nicer since I last looked. Rails moved to it from
Lighthouse... It appears to include all the best features from Trac,
including code integration
    <A HREF="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3243">https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3243</A>
    iPhone version of issue tracker...

- Easy to submit bug fixes, just fork it, make the changes, then send
pull request. Upstream (you) can easily argue code format, etc, etc and
then only pull once you are very happy with quality. Seems to work
somewhat better than random git repo pulls from around the internet in
practice... (opinion will vary of course)


- Cool network feature makes it quite easy to understand relationship
between submitted commits
    <A HREF="https://github.com/rails/rails/network">https://github.com/rails/rails/network</A>


Big picture stuff:

- Everything has an API.  Makes it possible to slurp everything out, or
automate it back in.  API is now looking very mature (currently V3 -
python wrapper included).  Shows commitment to avoid lockin...!
    <A HREF="http://developer.github.com/">http://developer.github.com/</A>

- Desktop integration. See Github app and Growl notification

- Full page websites can be hosted via the system. Everything under git
(easy backup or to take it elsewhere)
    <A HREF="http://pages.github.com/">http://pages.github.com/</A>

- Has paying customers - remember paying != not open source.  What it
means is that someone with money cares if it's not working right now or
data gets lost, or it's slow...  OSS hubs can/could have paying
customers also

- Architecture is largely based on OSS, however, the glue is
proprietary... Lots of visibility into the architecture though, evidence
of intention to avoid lock-in.  Public API for all aspects of the system
allows data to be pulled out and used elsewhere


Look, I really don't want to plug github as much as I have just done -
my only point is that you are avoiding looking at one of the most
amazing developer hubs currently available.  By all means don't use it,
but don't be ignorant of the features it offers over and above plain git
and even Gitorious (currently closest OSS competitor)
