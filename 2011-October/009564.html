<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> If it's true that people have to have a google account and a cookie to
</I>&gt;<i> interact with the project on google code, that should be an absolute bar
</I>&gt;<i> to that path.
</I>
I don't believe a Google account is required for read access, other
than for Google Groups which I wouldn't touch with insulated tongs.

&gt;<i> As for savannah, it seems that it's been reasonably reliable (and a
</I>&gt;<i> sub-week outage once a year isn't really that big a deal).  It seems
</I>&gt;<i> more reliable than kernel.org :-)
</I>
It has one other important advantage I forgot to mention.  I know
where to reach the admins in real time and they pay *very* careful
attention to my requests.  Sometimes being the silverback gorilla is
useful. :-)

While it is not unlikely that I have that kind of personal mojo with
the actual site admins at Google, Google is a much larger outfit with
more bureacratized processes.  So, while their guys might *personally*
feel as truly motivated as the Savannah people do to jump when I say
&quot;frog&quot;, their procedures would likely do more to prevent them from
instantly truckling to my every whim. This is undesirable :-).

&gt;<i>                      I know what you mean about FSF having
</I>&gt;<i> strong ideology, but I'm not aware of any (hosted, non-GNU) projects
</I>&gt;<i> having issues from it.
</I>
I had a minor one.  I actually created a GPSD project on Savannah many
months ago.  When I did, their then-designated approvals guy tried to
pressure me into applying a &quot;preferred&quot; FSF license. I raised hell
with the senior admins and they sat on him.  See above...

(I didn't move us then because doing so would have been a pain in the
ass and the need was not urgent.  Now we have a drop-dead date.)

&gt;<i> I am assuming you are not talking about making gpsd a &quot;GNU project&quot;, or
</I>&gt;<i> copyright assignment.
</I>
That's correct.

&gt;<i>                     As I understand it the FSF is ok with providing
</I>&gt;<i> hosting to projects that are not &quot;GNU projects&quot;, for which copyright is
</I>&gt;<i> not assigned, but which are available under a Free license (which gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> of course is).
</I>
Yes.  The Savannah GPSD project is on &quot;nongnu.org&quot;.

Current state of play is that I'm tuning a copy of the git repo at
Savannah so the critical project URLS are templated in, setting up mailing
lists over there, etc. If it looks like everything at Savannah works, I'll
cut us over. If not, I'll look at (for example) gitorious.
