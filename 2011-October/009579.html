Ed W &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">lists at wildgooses.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Kind of late - I moved us to Savannah days ago.  I did consider github, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but rejected the idea for various reasons, including:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. the github engine is proprietary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seems irrelevant, counter arguments are either:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) So was Berlios and how much good did that do you (is berlios opensource?)
</I>&gt;<i> b) Neither was Berlios and that didn't stop the project moving there
</I>&gt;<i> previously...
</I>
You seem confused.  The Berlios engine was not proprietary.

&gt;<i> I wasn't aware that Github has any mailing lists at all?  Can you send
</I>&gt;<i> me a reference?
</I>
I googled for &quot;github mailing lists&quot; and looked at the hits.  Of course,
if I was mistaken and there is no mailing list support, then github looks
like an even worse idea than it did.

&gt;<i> It's closing in approximately 3 months right?  That's &quot;imminent&quot;, but I
</I>&gt;<i> think &quot;explosion&quot; is perhaps over egging things a touch?
</I>
No, you're just not thinking through the risks.  What do you suppose
would have happened if Berlios had had, say, a serious disk crash
before I could move the project?  We already know the organization was
dying and understaffed.  If you think there would have been any recovery
at all after such an incident, you're *far* more an optimist than I am.

So, I spent four days working as fast as possible because I computed a
small but nonzero chance that our project metadata would irrecoverably
disappear on any given day after the shutdown announcement.  That
didn't happen, but I am very glad I didn't allow the window of
vulnerability to extend any longer than it did.

&gt;<i> - The final &quot;option&quot; is the easiest to overlook and that is that you
</I>&gt;<i> bond together your own structure from the individual best of breed
</I>&gt;<i> pieces...
</I>
I also considered that possibility.  See, again, no time to buy a new car
when you're fleeing an explosion.

One consequence of all this is that if we decide we have to move again (or
just that we want to) it will be much easier next time. I  know how to mine
mailing lists out of mailman instances rapidly, now.  I'd already written
a bugtracker-stripper.  And all the site-dependent URLs on the website
are now templated in from the scons recipe.
