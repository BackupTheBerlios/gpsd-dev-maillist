<PRE>Look, I don't want/need an internet fight - please don't misunderstand
where I'm coming from:

In this my opinion is that you completely focus on the wrong aspects:

</I>
My opinion is that you have/are focusing on completely the wrong
understanding of the problem.  By your own statement you perceive that
Berlios could loose all your data tomorrow and you would be &quot;in
trouble&quot;, but by implication you believed it was safe 1 year ago...! 
No! I would claim this is completely incorrect and remains the case even
after the move to Savannah (or anywhere else)

All these projects could suffer massive dataloss, hacking, hardware
failure, bankruptcy or plain &quot;can't be bothered&quot; at a moments notice. 
As the recent experience shows, Berlios is backed by a commercial
company and they could have turned off the whole system with zero
warning at ANY time over the last few years and there is no reason to
believe your data was every &quot;safe&quot; at any previous time. It's probably
not signficantly less safe now than it was at any previous time!!

You have spent the last few years walking down a cliff path where you
could fall and loose everything at a moments notice (which is fine).
Suddenly you perceive &quot;the risk&quot; because Berlios made some announcement,
but then you can't see the risks once you switch from one mountain path
to another equally risk mountain path...  Sorry, but I guarantee that
one day Savannah will stop hosting your project - with luck they will
give you a little notice, but possibly not...  Plan for failure now,
don't naively believe that any hub has any real more reliability than
any other...

If your work is important, have it archived offsite into multiple
locations - trusting any one provider, especially one that runs your
project as a pure loss leader, is sheer optimism...


Also, Open Source has proved completely irrelevant here by your own
admission.  Berlios you claim to be OSS, yet when it failed (now), that
appears to have been of zero benefit and by your own admission it's been
tricky extracting the data from their &quot;hub&quot;.  This seems no better
(possibly worse) than some non OSS provider such as Github who make
nearly everything extractable via a git clone, and all the other stuff
available over a well published and well used API system...  The hub is
just the hub - whether you can see inside it is of little benefit (usually)

Apart from political agendas (which are fine in my book, by all means
vote with your feet!!), I see no reason why the opensource nature or not
of any proposed hosting should have a practical effect?

Currently your top agenda appears to be how easy it is to get your data
in/out of the new hub(s).  I would suggest not using a single hub helps
there (you argue it hinders - which I don't even begin to
understand....).  However, it's all irrelevant, you identified that you
can't afford any hub hosting your project to fail, therefore you need to
stop trusting them entirely and make sure that anything you use from
here on has an ability to do a full offsite backup


I already posted the rather nice Wikipedia page.  However, here again
since I sense you didn't look at it before:
   
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities</A>

Read it how you like, but Savannah is way down near the bottom in terms
of size.  Not necessarily a problem, but you are betting on a 10+ year
future trend I guess?


Cheers
