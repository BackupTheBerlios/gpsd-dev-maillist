<PRE>Ed W &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">lists at wildgooses.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> My opinion is that you have/are focusing on completely the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of the problem.  By your own statement you perceive that
</I>&gt;<i> Berlios could loose all your data tomorrow and you would be &quot;in
</I>&gt;<i> trouble&quot;, but by implication you believed it was safe 1 year ago...! 
</I>
Actually, I didn't.  I've known Berlios was a risky place to be since
the outage in 2009 that intially scared me into writing forgeplucker.
But threat level moving from green to orange is not the same as moving
straight to red.

If you want to fault me for something, fault me for not moving us
sooner.  I succumbed to inertia, mainly because I didn't want to break
the continuity of the project mailing lists.  If I had moved us when I
had leisure to consider possibilities like github, perhaps you would
have liked the outcome better.  Or perhaps not.

&gt;<i> No! I would claim this is completely incorrect and remains the case even
</I>&gt;<i> after the move to Savannah (or anywhere else)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All these projects could suffer massive dataloss, hacking, hardware
</I>&gt;<i> failure, bankruptcy or plain &quot;can't be bothered&quot; at a moments notice. 
</I>
That is, in an absolute sense, perfectly true.  However, it is my
responsibility as the project lead to make judgments about *relative*
risk levels. The risk profiles of Berlios and Savannah are not the
same in any practical sense, no matter what theoretical arguments you
make about extreme scenarios.

I chose not to compound the prompt risks I judged we were facing last
week with the complexity of moving to a hosting site with a radically
different model, and I stand by that decision.

When and if you ever actually lead a project yourself and face a
similar decision under similar stress, I think you may find that
caution and a safe landing suddenly trump gee-whiz-wouldn't-it-be-cool.
For the sake of your users I hope that will be so.

&gt;<i> As the recent experience shows, Berlios is backed by a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> company
</I>
No.  A research institute funded by the German government.

&gt;<i>                                        Sorry, but I guarantee that
</I>&gt;<i> one day Savannah will stop hosting your project - with luck they will
</I>&gt;<i> give you a little notice, but possibly not...  Plan for failure now,
</I>&gt;<i> don't naively believe that any hub has any real more reliability than
</I>&gt;<i> any other...
</I>
Your argument indicts github as thoroughly as it indicts Savannah.
 
&gt;<i> If your work is important, have it archived offsite into multiple
</I>&gt;<i> locations - trusting any one provider, especially one that runs your
</I>&gt;<i> project as a pure loss leader, is sheer optimism...
</I>
Your argument indicts github as thoroughly as it indicts Savannah.

But in the long term you are right.  Which is why I've joined the Roundup
list and am discussing technical means for seamless state migration
between Roundup instances.  No Roundup-based forge yet exists, but
the probability that I might write one in increasing.
