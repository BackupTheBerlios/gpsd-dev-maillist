I think this is actually a _great_ idea, which we've already implemented 
but on a very coarse level.

I.e. we send specific types of messages, not on dedicated ms slots but 
on _date_ slots instead!

</I>&gt;<i> So, a simple extension to the DNS entry for a server can add the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary timeslice information required to contact it. By adjusting the
</I>&gt;<i> length of the timeslice, performance can be tuned for low-latency (short

</I>&gt;<i> switches, e.g. download mirrors).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The break-through of this technique is that it requires no change in ISP

</I>&gt;<i> many of these routers. End user's PCs will need a software upgrade to
</I>&gt;<i> the networking stack, but that can be rolled out through the usual
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms (e.g. &quot;Windows Update&quot;). The expensive, distributed,
