<PRE>For such to be routeable it would still require the machines sharing
the IP to be colocated and thus it would isolate the PCs from each
other or throttle local copying.  You mention DNS but ARP also has to
be taken into account.  Accuracy is fairly easy, the problem is jitter
in the whole system (if a computer in new york wants to talk to one in
LA, and there's variable latency, when can it transmit the packets,
particularly i fthere is fragmentation - Light goes at around 200
miles per microsecond in air, slightly slower in fiber).

One of the variants of the new Venus chips is specifically for precise
1PPS - The edge is only accurate to withing about 60ns (+/- 30)
because the CPU clock is only 16Mhz but it emits a private NMEA
sentence witha correction which brings it to +/- 10nS.  That about
corresponds to the location uncertainty of 3 meters.

</I>&gt;<i> Remember those CSIRO boffins that saved the wireless Internet with their

</I>&gt;<i> solving the IPv4 address space exhaustion problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every computer on the Internet needs a unique identifier, called an IP
</I>&gt;<i> address. These numbers are 32-bits long, giving a theoretical 4-billion
</I>&gt;<i> unique addresses, but for technical reasons the number is much lower and
</I>&gt;<i> with the number of computers (and smart-phones!) on the net, we're about
</I>&gt;<i> to run out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The solution appears to be to add another dimension to the address;
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Computers can share IP addresses as long as they agree on when they'll
</I>&gt;<i> use it. This already happens at a very coarse level; when your modem
</I>&gt;<i> turns off, its IP address becomes available for someone else to use. By
</I>&gt;<i> making this sharing much more fine-grained (in the order of
</I>&gt;<i> milliseconds) you can effectively use the same address more than once
</I>&gt;<i> _simultaneously_!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, a simple extension to the DNS entry for a server can add the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary timeslice information required to contact it. By adjusting the
</I>&gt;<i> length of the timeslice, performance can be tuned for low-latency (short
</I>&gt;<i> timeslices, e.g. a game server) or high throughput (long slices, few
</I>&gt;<i> switches, e.g. download mirrors).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The break-through of this technique is that it requires no change in ISP
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure. The core routers need an upgraded routing table to
</I>&gt;<i> implement the time-slice-based routing, but there aren't actually that
</I>&gt;<i> many of these routers. End user's PCs will need a software upgrade to
</I>&gt;<i> the networking stack, but that can be rolled out through the usual
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms (e.g. &quot;Windows Update&quot;). The expensive, distributed,
</I>&gt;<i> difficult-to-update ISP routers can stay in place, blissfully unaware of
</I>&gt;<i> the change.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
