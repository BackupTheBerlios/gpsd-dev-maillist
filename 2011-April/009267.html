I'll try some benchmarks, but there tends to be problems the faster
the data goes (an occasional 1% at 1Hz can turn into several percent
at 20Hz).

It also gets more important the lower you go.  The 200Mhz and under
MIPS (think DD-WRT router) without floating point would be even worse.
 My fully optimized integer minigpsd was using about a half-percent
CPU per Hz.

At the moment I'm working directly with the Venus 638 firmware since
it is a 50MHz sparc core.  I think I could get json out of the second
serial port :).

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. GLONASS support, at least the Venus NMEA strings unless another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chipset comes out that does glonass.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're just talking about writing an NMEA-variant a driver for the Venus,
</I>&gt;<i> that's not a large change and wouldn't destabilize core code. &#160;I might be
</I>&gt;<i> willing to take that before 3.0.
</I>
It would have to be a separate driver.  I posted a chunk.  You get two
GNGSA sentences, one for each system, then GPGSVs and GLGSVs, as
needed and other things move or change subtly.

&gt;&gt;<i> I also posted some garmin NMEA 5Hz midnight rollover problem logs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the list a few weeks ago. &#160;Those should probably be added to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regression test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, is that what they were? I've been meaning to ask. &#160;They didn't seem
</I>&gt;<i> annotated with information on what they were demonstrating.
</I>
There was discussion context in surrounding messages - they were just
the midnight area showing the bug in the garmin.
