<PRE>Hi Eric,

I was wondering about getting this on the gpsd mailing list.

It seems to be relevant as many end-user PCs will now need very
accurate times to take advantage of -TDM.

I wasn't sure what the policy on this kind of, uhm, announcement, was
so I thought I'd better ask first.

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Remember those CSIRO boffins that saved the wireless Internet with their
congestion algorithm? Well, they're about to save the whole Internet by
solving the IPv4 address space exhaustion problem.

Every computer on the Internet needs a unique identifier, called an IP
address. These numbers are 32-bits long, giving a theoretical 4-billion
unique addresses, but for technical reasons the number is much lower and
with the number of computers (and smart-phones!) on the net, we're about
to run out.

The solution appears to be to add another dimension to the address;
time.

Computers can share IP addresses as long as they agree on when they'll
use it. This already happens at a very coarse level; when your modem
turns off, its IP address becomes available for someone else to use. By
making this sharing much more fine-grained (in the order of
milliseconds) you can effectively use the same address more than once
_simultaneously_!

So, a simple extension to the DNS entry for a server can add the
necessary timeslice information required to contact it. By adjusting the
length of the timeslice, performance can be tuned for low-latency (short
timeslices, e.g. a game server) or high throughput (long slices, few
switches, e.g. download mirrors).

The break-through of this technique is that it requires no change in ISP
infrastructure. The core routers need an upgraded routing table to
implement the time-slice-based routing, but there aren't actually that
many of these routers. End user's PCs will need a software upgrade to
the networking stack, but that can be rolled out through the usual
mechanisms (e.g. &quot;Windows Update&quot;). The expensive, distributed,
difficult-to-update ISP routers can stay in place, blissfully unaware of
the change.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
