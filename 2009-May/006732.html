ah. i mentally transmogrified &quot;wine&quot; to &quot;somehow i'd like to be able

Which sounds like writing an emulator to me. A program that mimics
enough of the behaviour and interface of a real garmin device to fool
mapsource into thinking that it's talking to a real device.

Gpsd writes to tcp sockets, not special nodes. I think the right way
to do this is not hack this garmin emulation into the daemon, but
rather to write a separate tool to handle the protocol. Have this tool
communicate through a pty/tty pair and wine should just see it as a
serial port.

Looking at the history of open-source garmin support, it's not as
trivial as other protocols. It's bidirectional, interactive,
apparently timing-sensitive, and not completely documented. Not
something I'm keen to undertake.
