<PRE>Eivind, Chris Kuethe has been testing older revs of the code and believes he
has fingered commit 3690 as the point where the bug blocking 2.35
release was introduced.  Thois the one where gpsd spins on a high
connection rate.  Looking at the diff, I can readily believe the bug 
arose from this policy change.

Accordingly, I'm planning to back your diff out of trunk.  I am not
giving up on it; rather, what I want to do is commit a diff that
covers a lot of the trivial changes so we can isolate the substantive
ones and figure out what went wrong.

We may need your help in re-applying the non-trivial changes. Please
acknowledge this mail so we;ll know you're still alive out there.

This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were
no religion in it.	-- John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson.
