</I>
My understanding is, that gpsd gets to a point where it takes 100% cpu, but 
still functions. If it gets into this mode you should be able to interrupt it 
at any time, and should be able to just single step it through a few selects. 
Since it can only take 100% if select returns immediately that implies that 
one of the expected events happens without delay. Most likely the condition 
that triggered the return of select the last time has not been cleared (i.e. 
a ready-for-read fd was not read from) the next time you enter select it will 
just return the same fd again immediately.

It looks like an fd gets not dropped from all_fds, although it should.

BTW: a 'for loop' with over threehundred lines of code in it is not my kind of 
humor. Maybe that's just me :-(

&gt;<i> xterm1: (some versions of top can match strings like &quot;gps&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> top
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> xterm2: (foreground and debug is easier to watch but it makes no
</I>&gt;<i> difference) ./gpsd -n -N -D2 /dev/gps
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> xterm3: (may need to use &quot;nc -w 1&quot; if your nc doesn't close properly)
</I>&gt;<i> for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f ; do
</I>&gt;<i>     echo O | nc 127.0.0.1 2947 &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> done
</I>
That means we are opening _and_ closing connections quickly? (sorry I am not 
nc-enabled)

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW: I have a report claiming this bug with a version way older than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this. Take it with a grain of salt...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dunno, I had the connection rate up to ~100conn/sec before r3690 with
</I>&gt;<i> no ill effect. Maybe it's a different bug that just looks the same?
</I>
Hence the salt ;-)

I feel the urge to re-shape main, so it becomes a bit more manageable.

A single function with more than 570 loc... That's just not natural !-)

Cheers,
Remco
