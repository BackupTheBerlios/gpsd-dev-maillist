Yeah, I'm almost inclined to rewrite that so it just sets a global
&quot;sig_atomic_t lastsig&quot; and returns. The main loop can then check
whether SIGHUP was received and reinitialize, or some other terminal
signal and quit.

Longjmp inside a signal handler feels a little wierd, even if it
works. It feels a little more wierd considering that we'd be returning
to a loop anyway, and we could easily break out of that loop with by
testing the aforementioned sig_atomic_t ...

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
