<PRE>------ Original Message ------

&gt;<i> &gt; I stared at this diff for a few minutes now, but I can't see what the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difference is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What am I missing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that &quot;&lt;&quot; operation is not defined for pointers in C. Only &quot;==&quot;,
</I>&quot;!=&quot;,
&gt;<i> &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't check for details, old code rejected some NMEA packets with
</I>correct
&gt;<i> checksum, new code accept them all, it just works.
</I>
I checked log files from yesterday and I don't know what was wrong. Maybe it
was not gpsd code. Anyway, please, apply the patch to packet.c, I think that
original code used invalid pointer test.

1) gpsd was losing bytes from serial port /dev/ttyS1, as a result, checksum
was incorrect and gpsd reported strange data as it processed just some NMEA
messages from the stream, huge number of messages was lost
2) Command &quot;cat /dev/ttyS1&quot; lost no data, at least I didn't notice that
3) I restarted gpsd several times, I added a message that &quot;checksum is wrong&quot;,
I saw the problem with checksum, it was repeatable
4) when I changed packet.c code, problem was fixed
5) I reverted packet.c to original state today but I cannot repeat the problem
from yesterday. (PC was rebooted in the morning)

I have explanation that my system was corrupted in some way yesterday or maybe
it was overloaded with some other task, maybe Firefox (system overload
explains, why cat reported correct data from the serial port and why gpsd was
not so successful)

With regards,
Petr
