I recently looked at the signal handler code. The longjmp here looks
strange. I've never seen such a thing before: Usually signal handlers
should return immediatly. But this one seems to jump at the beginning
of the main loop and stay there. This is something ingenious. Maybe
someone could explain why this works. I expect it's because the handler
don't return so there is no interrupted routine which get disturbed.

Cheers, Andy
