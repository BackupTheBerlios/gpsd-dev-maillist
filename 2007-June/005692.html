<PRE>Gentlemen,

maybe you know what happens when you unplug and re-plug your serial mouse in
X-windows under Linux. Mouse doesn't work any more, you have to restart whole
X-windows to initialise mouse. OK, this was solved recently, you don't need to
restart X-windows on the latest Linux distributions anymore in 2007 but it was
needed one or two years ago. (I think mouse sends some signal that it was
connected and needs initialization but this query was ignored by mouse driver
for long time).

gpsd has similar problems with some GPSs, you start gpsd, GPS is detected,
initialized, it works for some time. You reboot GPS (remove power plug, change
battery, etc), GPS is initialized, maybe it has possition but it doesn't pass
information to gpsd, it is invisible for gpsd. You have to restart gpsd to
start detection process. When you restart gpsd, all connected clients are
disconnected.

Garmin eTrex in binary mode is an example of GPS that can be detected during
gpsd start but cannot be reactivated when you &quot;reset&quot; GPS because GPS is
silent after reset, it needs &quot;wakeup&quot; commands. I think this is missing
feature in gpsd design. What to do when no data are received for some time
(timeout). When to start new search for GPS.

With regards,
