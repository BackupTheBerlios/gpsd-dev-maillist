i can replicate it very easily, simply open a bunch of connections
really fast. I'll see if i'm quick enough with the break or
whatever...

xterm1: (some versions of top can match strings like &quot;gps&quot;)
top

xterm2: (foreground and debug is easier to watch but it makes no difference)
./gpsd -n -N -D2 /dev/gps

xterm3: (may need to use &quot;nc -w 1&quot; if your nc doesn't close properly)
for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f ; do
    echo O | nc 127.0.0.1 2947 &amp;
done

&gt;<i> BTW: I have a report claiming this bug with a version way older than this.
</I>&gt;<i> Take it with a grain of salt...
</I>
Dunno, I had the connection rate up to ~100conn/sec before r3690 with
no ill effect. Maybe it's a different bug that just looks the same?

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
