Those two lines are very hard to compare out of context. IIRC, lexer-&gt;inbuffer 
is a character pointer, not a void pointer. The cast to (char *) in the first 
line is redundant. If it were not, then the second line would be incorrect, 
since you use the uncast lexer-&gt;inbuffer to retrieve an object that you then 
cast to (char), which is NOT the same. The correct thing is to drop the cast 
in both cases.

Looking at those lines alone, the first one is more efficient. Your version 
actually reads every array element and compares it to '*'. The fist one does 
not touch any data from the array. I know what is more efficient :-)

OTOH, the first line has more information to start with. The cost of getting 
this information may just destroy any advantage it has over the second line. 

Although I also remember the same problem with an old x86 C compiler, that is 
only anecdotal. The real question is what the standard says. Since it is 
Sunday I can't be bothered to do the heavy reading, but here is a translation 
into common English:
   <A HREF="http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/chapter5/pointer_expressions.html">http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/chapter5/pointer_expressions.html</A>

In short I quote:
==========================================
5.7.3. Relational expressions
These allow us to compare pointers with each other. You can only compare

    o Pointers to compatible object types with each other
    o Pointers to compatible incomplete types with each other

It does not matter if the types that are pointed to are qualified or 
unqualified.
If two pointers compare equal to each other then they point to the same thing, 
whether it is an object or the non-existent element off the end of an array 
(see arithmetic, above). If two pointers point to the same thing, then they 
compare equal to each other. The relational operators &gt;, &lt;= and so on all 
give the result that you would expect if the pointers point into the same 
array: if one pointer compares less than another, then it points nearer to 
the front of the array.
==========================================

My feeling is: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

I have to admit that your second (?) patch looked nicer than the current code, 
though.

Cheers,
Remco
