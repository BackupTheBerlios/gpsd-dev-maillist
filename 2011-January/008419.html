<PRE>The problem with even an opaque blob is that it typically needs some
kind of interaction to send it to the gps - usually simple cutting it
up into blocks and using checksums, but then commands for entering the
mode and exiting.

This is probably something which should wait until AFTER THIS RELEASE

I think the feature addtions are getting a bit out of hand, at least
for a monolithic gpsd-ng.  Perhaps the device drivers should be plugin
modules that for gpsd itself, just return that data, but then have
APIs (and perhaps individual control programs) for all the special
cases.

gpsd is basically a multiplexer-demultiplexer - getting data from one
or more sources, and sending it to one or more sinks.  The sinks can
be quite different, but the sources are already getting that way.
When it was just Garmin and NMEA it was ugly.  Now it is multiple
binary and multiple NMEA-wth-quirks and extensions.

I would prefer to split the NMEA basic (and/or equivalent from the
binary) support which is what gpsd will be used for in 99.9% of the
time, from the other interesting data and/or setup.  This also affects
what is provded.  Ought things like barometric pressure and gyro data
be provided by gpsd in event driven JSON?  Or should there be a second
or different program (since I like the architecture) that can act as
the catch-all for the sensor information which is not strict GPS and
might not even be strictly for navigation?
