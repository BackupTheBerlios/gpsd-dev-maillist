<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Are we now reporting the complete set of subframes, or is there more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information still to be extracted?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but probably not remotely in the final form and no guarantees of
</I>&gt;<i> completeness, correctness, splint-ness, etc.
</I>
I splint-cleaned it this norning.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; 2. I'm always concerned about numerical stability in reports of float
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quantities. There are two problems here: (a) Repeatability for regression
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; testing, and (b) Lossless reporting for clients who would prefer to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their own scaling in order to avoid (for example) issues with IEEE754
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conformance or the lack of it on their platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, and I have been torn over how much or how little post processing to
</I>&gt;<i> do.  Prolly makes sense to dump both the raw and massaged data and that
</I>&gt;<i> would be easy.  Harder is to dump in a way to not trigger the float
</I>&gt;<i> regression issues you rightly bring up.
</I>
The way I handle this is the AIS context is as follows:

(1) Have a &quot;scaled&quot; property defaulting to false.

(2) In scaled=false mode, dump only unscaled data. All regression tests
run in this mode.

(3) In scaled=true mode, dump scaled floats. Accept that this will
not be regressionable and the output may be platform-dependant.

&gt;<i> And then beyond that, there are the many questions of how many decimal
</I>&gt;<i> places to report on each floating point value and to report in
</I>&gt;<i> semi-circles as the IS-GPS-200E calls for, or radians as many people
</I>&gt;<i> seem to be expecting.
</I>
Really answering &quot;how many places&quot; would take numerical analysis of the
float ranges for each data item. I did this for AIS, which thankfully
ships a lot fewer floats.

As for units, I think we should emit whatever native units IS-GPS-200E calls
for so we have minimum loss of precision to unit conversions. It's the
client's job to do interpretation.

&gt;<i> &gt; 3. The output JSON needs to be documented on the gpsd(8) manual page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably WAY too much clutter, maybe a gpsd-json(8) page?  In any case
</I>&gt;<i> not much point until the content is settled, and I fear that will be
</I>&gt;<i> a while....
</I>
To be revisited.  I don't think it needs to be huge amount of clutter if we
let reference to IS-GPS-200E do most of the work.

&gt;<i> I also have a lot of issues on JSON encoding:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What floating point formats work?
</I>
Hm, looks like e notation works after all.

&gt;<i> How do I encode a string that includes random double quotes in it (the
</I>&gt;<i> system message)?
</I>
Backslash-escape it.

&gt;<i> How do I encode arrays?
</I>
I presume you've learned about JSON array notation by now.  If not,
it's in the RFC.

&gt;<i> Should I encode arrays (a[0], a[1],...) instead of naming the varables
</I>&gt;<i> as does the IS-GPS-200E (ERD1, ERD2,... ERD25)?
</I>
That de[pends o the semantics of the data.  Do we expect that client
apps will want to treat it as a unit?  If so, definitely as an array.
(I think this will usually be the right choice when it's possibl e at
all.)

&gt;<i> Is it OK to have class:SUBFRAME where the first part is fixed and
</I>&gt;<i> the second part is variable or should there be a sub class for each
</I>&gt;<i> different data set?  An example of that is Omega0 in subframe 3 and in
</I>&gt;<i> subframe 5 that have different precisions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If sub classes are used, how would they look?
</I>
I'm OK with the SUBFRAME class having a variable inventory, as long as
the subtype field is always present and unambiguous.

&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Support in the client-side library. Now that we can ship JSON subframes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up the pipe to a client, the client lib needs to be able to parse those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back into C structs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, but like the doc, until the JSON is settled that would be a tad
</I>&gt;<i> premature.
</I>
Fair.
