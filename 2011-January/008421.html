<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The problem with even an opaque blob is that it typically needs some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of interaction to send it to the gps - usually simple cutting it
</I>&gt;<i> up into blocks and using checksums, but then commands for entering the
</I>&gt;<i> mode and exiting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is probably something which should wait until AFTER THIS RELEASE
</I>
Very much so, yes. I'm not yet convinced it's a good idea.

&gt;<i> I think the feature addtions are getting a bit out of hand, at least
</I>&gt;<i> for a monolithic gpsd-ng.  Perhaps the device drivers should be plugin
</I>&gt;<i> modules that for gpsd itself, just return that data, but then have
</I>&gt;<i> APIs (and perhaps individual control programs) for all the special
</I>&gt;<i> cases.
</I>
*Shudder*  Individual control programs and proliferating special cases 
is *exactly* what I've worked hard to get us away from. In that direction
lies only an unmaintainable mess. I'll return to the plugin issue below.

&gt;<i> gpsd is basically a multiplexer-demultiplexer - getting data from one
</I>&gt;<i> or more sources, and sending it to one or more sinks.  The sinks can
</I>&gt;<i> be quite different, but the sources are already getting that way.
</I>&gt;<i> When it was just Garmin and NMEA it was ugly.  Now it is multiple
</I>&gt;<i> binary and multiple NMEA-wth-quirks and extensions.
</I>
Yes. Unavoidably so, given the hardware territory it has to cover just
to deliver basic GPS data.  The newer stuff like AIS is only a
relatively small increment of complexity over what's irreducibly
required to do GPS right, given that we have a dozen vendor binary
protocols to cope with.

&gt;<i> I would prefer to split the NMEA basic (and/or equivalent from the
</I>&gt;<i> binary) support which is what gpsd will be used for in 99.9% of the
</I>&gt;<i> time, from the other interesting data and/or setup.
</I>
We have configure switches to invidually suppress the features beyond NMEA.
This is possible because most of the device-specific complexity is pushed
down into drivers that are quite well isolated from each other.

The driver architecture we already have (with the relatively thin layer 
of dispatcher/multiplexor code on top) does about everything a &quot;plugin&quot;
architecture could do, except dynamically load the driver parts. I don't
think the driver parts are large enough to justify dynamic loading; they
sum total to about 200K of object code and average 12.5K each.

&gt;<i>               Ought things like barometric pressure and gyro data
</I>&gt;<i> be provided by gpsd in event driven JSON?  Or should there be a second
</I>&gt;<i> or different program (since I like the architecture) that can act as
</I>&gt;<i> the catch-all for the sensor information which is not strict GPS and
</I>&gt;<i> might not even be strictly for navigation?
</I>
I think you're confounding two distinct questions here.

1. Would there be any gain from splitting gpsd into multiple separate
daemons to handle different subsets of the data it now handles?

2. What sorts of data are in scope for gpsd?

1 is a question mainly about software engineering tradeoffs and I think the
answer is clearly &quot;no&quot;.  All such a split would accomplish is to require
multiple instances of the dispatcher/multiplexer layer to be maintained
separately, and complicate life for clients because they'd have to
monitor multiple service ports.  Aggregate complexity would substantially
increase.
 
2 is a more interesting question, less about nuts-and-bolts software
engineering and more philosophical. I don't claim to have a final
answer to it.  Anything GPS-related is clearly in scope.  I think AIS
is too as it is interesting navigational information meant to be used
in conjunction with GPS.  Likewise for the take from magnetic
compasses.

We get into a gray area with stuff like water-temperature sensors
and fish finders. I'd have to think long and hard before adding those.
On the other hand, merging in the take from aircraft transponders would 
be an obvious win.

I guess my figure of merit for stuff like this is &quot;how close to the
navigation problem&quot; divided by &quot;LOC to implement&quot;.  Close stuff like
AIS justifies substantial code additions; things further away might
slip in if the code weight of the driver is low.
