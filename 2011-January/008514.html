<PRE>I've been wrestling with some GPS calendar issues recently, trying to find ways
around the GPS week rollover problem. One result of this is that I've been 
looking at the timestamps on JSON sentences - and finding them annoyingly 
hard to read.  They're encoded as seconds UTC since the Unix epoch (the start
of 1 Jan 1970).

I am, therefore, contemplating one last change to our JSON-based
encoding before we ship 3.0 and announce it's done.  That is to change
the timestamp format to ISO 8601.  So, instead of looking like

   1295713512.87

timestamps would look like

   2011-01-22T11:25:12.87Z

There are currently exactly two such fields: fix time (per TPV) and
skyview time (per SKY).

I'm soliciting comment on this proposal.  There's been a bit of discussion on 
the IRC channel, so I can address a couple  of issues that have already come up.

Effect on code complexity: None. Clients have to call atof(3) or equivalent
now before thay can do arithmetic on a timestamp; with this change, they'd 
have to call strptime(3).

Effect on code portability: None. Both decoders (and encoders) are in 
Single Unix Specification.

Effect on code size: None, the library already has a unix_to_iso8601()
and iso8601_to_unix() functions. (These are used in logging and gpsmon.)

Effect on performance: Encoding/decoding ISO 8601 is *very slightly* 
more expensive than encoding raw integers; on the other hand, for
ordinary display use (as in, for example, xgps) clients will
often be able to shove ISO8601 to output without decoding at all.

Effect on readability: This is the big win. A human eyeball can't 
make sense of a Unix timestamp, but an ISO 8601 one is instantly
parseable - so, for example, week wraparound errors would be glaringly
obvious.

Transition cost: Minimal. The diff for a test implementation is 154 lines,
counting context and headers and including clients. No change to C client 
API or structures.

One final note: it has been suggested that sentences could include
both forms, as a compatibility hack.  I oppose this on the basis of the
SPOT rule - representations should have as single point of truth
for any given piece of data.  &quot;No junk, no confusion.&quot;

This change would, of course, bump the protocol version number.

I'd like to hear pro and con arguments.
