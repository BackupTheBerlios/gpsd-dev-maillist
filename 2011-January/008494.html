   That's correct. What I would propose would be something as follows:

 1. UTC message received
 2. Obtain current &#916;t from UTC message
 3. Lookup &#916;t in precompiled table (&#916;t, date_firstvalid, date_lastvalid)
 4. If current date as reported by GPS is between the values obtained
from the table, all good, stop.
 5. If values disagree, a week rollover error must have occurred,
correct the GPS reported date if unambiguous, or report an error, and stop.
 6. If &#916;t is not found in the precompiled table, and &#916;t &#8804; &#916;tN + &#949;, then
curve fit a date and compare against currently reported date.
 7. If values from previous calculation agree, stop.
 8. If values disagree, report an error, stop. Do not attempt to correct.

   Where:

 * &#916;t is the same as &#916;tUTC as defined in 20.3.3.5.2.4 in IS-GPS-200E
 * date_{first,last}valid are the times when a particular &#916;t first
becomes valid, and just before the next leap second occurrence. Note
that this a logical, not physical, representation (meaning one only
needs to store a list of (&#916;t, time_of_occurrence) pairs.
 * &#916;tN is the last &#916;t value in our precompiled table. This would be
expected to be up to six months in the future, counting from the release
date of a particular gpsd version (leaps second
adjustments/non-adjustments are announced about six months in advance).
 * &#949; is a small integer (e.g., 0, &#177;1 or &#177;2) such that a curve (or
linear) fit of the last few values in our precompiled table would have a
fighting chance of success. This covers the case where the user has a
non-recent but not too old version of gpsd.

   Notes/caveats:

 * Keep in mind that leap seconds may be positive or negative (hence why
&#949; is not defined as a small *positive* integer).
 * In the event of negative leap seconds, the precompiled table will
contain ambiguities, which could cause false negatives. It also makes it
unadvisable to correct the rollover error in the presence of an ambiguity.
 * Similarly, the application of a polynomial fit for values outside our
table introduces the possibility of false positives (the probability
increasing directly with time, hence why &#949;), so although we can report
if we think something might be out of whack, it would not be wise to
correct the rollover error, as we might be dealing with a false
positive. As Eric says, in light of this it might not even be worth
bothering with steps 6-8.


Christoph,

   I am not entirely clear what are the risks involved with this method
(this could always be complemented by the -15 years test that you
suggest). Could you please give your opinion on the above approach?

   I do think that this kind of correction might be slightly on the
overkill side of things, but if it's cleanly implemented, I can't see it
introducing an excessive amount of complexity in the code.

   If nothing else, it puts gpsd on the &quot;only we can do this&quot; category,
and creates prior art which might deprive someone of a preposterous
patent someday.


Regards,
Diego Berge.
