The problem is you need several conditions:

1. The device must support both downloading and uploading the
ephemeris.  Also noting which sats have valid data and which haven't
been seen or the data isn't there.
2. The format of the ephemeris must not be a binary blob (The nokia
N810 does this).
3. The GPS doesn't have a battery backup even for the time and ephemeris
Note:  If you don't know the current UTC time the ephemeris won't be
of any help.  Maybe if you find the first satellite or can also upload
the time.
4. Whichever GPS, chipset, etc. that can get past these conditions
must be more important to support rather than getting a $30 GPS that
has a battery.
5. AGPS IS the ephemeris for all satellites for 7 days, but most are
binary blobs - If we could find a source with decoded versions we
could upload, we could AGPS enable any device that supports this.  But
failing that, there are far more devices that support AGPS in some
form than an ephemeris.

Compare the payoff and difficulty of the Ephemeris v.s. AGPS.
Here I'm asking.  I know it is possible, but is it worth the effort?
