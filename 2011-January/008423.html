</I>
I would rather there be many external unmantainable or unmaintained
bits rather than having all of them inside the key parts of gpsd
itself.

Almanacs, agpsd, and the rest are already being talked about for inclusion.

&gt;&gt;<i> gpsd is basically a multiplexer-demultiplexer - getting data from one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or more sources, and sending it to one or more sinks. &#160;The sinks can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be quite different, but the sources are already getting that way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When it was just Garmin and NMEA it was ugly. &#160;Now it is multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> binary and multiple NMEA-wth-quirks and extensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Unavoidably so, given the hardware territory it has to cover just
</I>&gt;<i> to deliver basic GPS data. &#160;The newer stuff like AIS is only a
</I>&gt;<i> relatively small increment of complexity over what's irreducibly
</I>&gt;<i> required to do GPS right, given that we have a dozen vendor binary
</I>&gt;<i> protocols to cope with.
</I>
The problem is the small increments tend to collect into a big mess.

&gt;&gt;<i> I would prefer to split the NMEA basic (and/or equivalent from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> binary) support which is what gpsd will be used for in 99.9% of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time, from the other interesting data and/or setup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have configure switches to invidually suppress the features beyond NMEA.
</I>&gt;<i> This is possible because most of the device-specific complexity is pushed
</I>&gt;<i> down into drivers that are quite well isolated from each other.
</I>
Suppressing something means it is still there and it really isn't
isolated if something in a driver breaks the build as a whole.

&gt;<i> The driver architecture we already have (with the relatively thin layer
</I>&gt;<i> of dispatcher/multiplexor code on top) does about everything a &quot;plugin&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> architecture could do, except dynamically load the driver parts. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think the driver parts are large enough to justify dynamic loading; they
</I>&gt;<i> sum total to about 200K of object code and average 12.5K each.
</I>
This is OK if the drivers stay limited - the API or functionality
doesn't expand, nor if their number starts increasing.

I don't know that this will happen, but I already have a large number
of different GPS units.  If the drivers are going to be vanilla NMEA,
they are already there.  If I want to add in all the special feature
support, it might start making it bigger.

If the GPS covered by a binary driver can do NMEA, do we want to keep
the binary driver?  If so, then do we add specific drivers for
everyone?

For that matter, lets say I have two GPS units - one is a very
sensitive precise WAAS enabled unit with a resolution of 1Hz, and a
second has basic data at 10Hz.  Can I get both?  (That is a problem I
had to work out on my embedded version).  This is not uncommon - think
about a cell phone or mobile device and a car with a BT GPS.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Ought things like barometric pressure and gyro data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be provided by gpsd in event driven JSON? &#160;Or should there be a second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or different program (since I like the architecture) that can act as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the catch-all for the sensor information which is not strict GPS and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might not even be strictly for navigation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're confounding two distinct questions here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Would there be any gain from splitting gpsd into multiple separate
</I>&gt;<i> daemons to handle different subsets of the data it now handles?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What sorts of data are in scope for gpsd?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 is a question mainly about software engineering tradeoffs and I think the
</I>&gt;<i> answer is clearly &quot;no&quot;. &#160;All such a split would accomplish is to require
</I>&gt;<i> multiple instances of the dispatcher/multiplexer layer to be maintained
</I>&gt;<i> separately, and complicate life for clients because they'd have to
</I>&gt;<i> monitor multiple service ports. &#160;Aggregate complexity would substantially
</I>&gt;<i> increase.
</I>
The other way might be a JSON merge mechanism - so I could write
something to take data not supported by GPSD itself, send it into a
port, (be validated and tagged,) and it would appear in the event
stream.  You could even have some officially supported bits for the
interesting and useful but 4-sigma cases.

&gt;<i> 2 is a more interesting question, less about nuts-and-bolts software
</I>&gt;<i> engineering and more philosophical. I don't claim to have a final
</I>&gt;<i> answer to it. &#160;Anything GPS-related is clearly in scope. &#160;I think AIS
</I>&gt;<i> is too as it is interesting navigational information meant to be used
</I>&gt;<i> in conjunction with GPS. &#160;Likewise for the take from magnetic
</I>&gt;<i> compasses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We get into a gray area with stuff like water-temperature sensors
</I>&gt;<i> and fish finders. I'd have to think long and hard before adding those.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, merging in the take from aircraft transponders would
</I>&gt;<i> be an obvious win.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess my figure of merit for stuff like this is &quot;how close to the
</I>&gt;<i> navigation problem&quot; divided by &quot;LOC to implement&quot;. &#160;Close stuff like
</I>&gt;<i> AIS justifies substantial code additions; things further away might
</I>&gt;<i> slip in if the code weight of the driver is low.
</I>
The first part is reasonable - the lat/long/alt, the quality of data,
heading and V and H speed are reasonable.  Probably magnetic compass
too (though if you are pointed north and heading east?).  I think of
&quot;GPS&quot; as &quot;Navigation&quot;.  Where am I, and where am I headed.

The second - there are 3 approaches.  First would be the merge
external input mechanism - you would need a custom fishfinder program,
feed it into gpsd, then any app could use it, the second is to put it
inside gpsd somewhere, the third is to have a fishfinder program that
pulls the gpsd information and does the merge.  The problem with #2 is
then it will have to be maintained as part of this project.  #3 makes
it an application program, so something like a generic logger wouldn't
get the data.  I don't know if #1 would be difficult or present other
problems.

My most common application is to take vehicle performance data (OBD2
type info) and sensors (compass/gyro/accel) and merge that with GPS
information since it helps to know when and where something
interesting in the data happened.  So I tend to think of the problems
in that context.
