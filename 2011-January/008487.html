<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I've looked at your comments in enum_sourcetype and still can't figure
</I>&gt;<i> things out.  Before I expand the comments, please check my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Each file descriptor that is treated as a potential source has an
</I>&gt;<i>   associated sourcetype_t.
</I>
Correct.
 
&gt;<i>   pty, tcp, and udp I get.  But I don't understand what &quot;not used&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   means.  If you mean &quot;Currently, this value does not trigger any
</I>&gt;<i>   special behavior.&quot; we should probably make that clearer.
</I>
Yes.  Actually, this has since changed in two ways, which I document below.

&gt;<i>   blockdev seems like it would be an error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I don't really understand what &quot;discoverable&quot; means.
</I>
See below.
 
&gt;<i>   rs232 means that there is a real serial port on the computer, and the
</I>&gt;<i>   file descriptor refers to that serial port.
</I>
That is correct.  This from my current source tree should be
illuminating.

/*
 * Each input source has an associated type.  This is currently used in two
 * ways:
 *
 * (1) To determince if we require that gpsd be the only process opening a 
 * device.  We make an exception for PTYs because the master side has to be
 * opened by test code,
 *
 * (2) To determine whether it's safe to send wakeup strings.  These are
 * required on some unusual RS-232 devices (such as the TNT compass and
 * Thales/Ashtech GPSes) but should not be shipped to unidentified USB 
 * or Bluetooth devices as we don't even know in advance those are GPSEs;
 * they might not cope well.
 *
 * Where it says &quot;case detected but not used&quot; it means that we can identify
 * a source type but no behavior is yet contingent on it.  A &quot;discoverable&quot;
 * device is one for which there is discoverable metadata such as a 
 * vendor/product ID.
 *
 * We should never see a block device; that would indicate a serious error
 * in command-line usage or the hotplug system.
 */
typedef enum {source_unknown,
	      source_blockdev,	/* block devices can't be GPS sources */
	      source_rs232,	/* potential GPS source, not discoverable */ 
	      source_usb,	/* potential GPS source, discoverable */ 
	      source_bluetooth,	/* potential GPS source, discoverable */ 
	      source_pty,	/* PTY: we don't require exclusive access */ 
	      source_tcp,	/* TCP/IP stream: case detected but not used */ 
	      source_udp,	/* UDP stream: case detected but not used */ 
} sourcetype_t;

&gt;<i>   usb could cover any of the following
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     1) there's a usb/serial converter, and a serial port connection to a
</I>&gt;<i>     GPSr
</I>
I take it you intend this to be your case 4 with no USB metadata?  I've never
seen this happen.

&gt;<i>     2) there's a USB GPSr plugged in, and it presents as a generic USB
</I>&gt;<i>     serial port
</I>
Doesn't happen.  It would be theoretically possible, but in practice nobody -
and I mean *nobody* - builds receiver modules that present USB.  Universally
they're built with CMOS- or TTL-level RS232 out, and get bolted together
with USB-to-serial adapter chips.  It is unlikely this will change, as 
full USB is *way* overkill for a receiver's communications requirements.

&gt;<i>     3) there's a USB GPSr plugged in, and it presents as a generic USB
</I>&gt;<i>     device that is not a serial port.
</I>
To my knowledge this never occurs.
 
&gt;<i>     4) there's a USB GPSr plugged in, and it presents as a USB serial
</I>&gt;<i>     port or modem, but has some device identifiers that make it possible
</I>&gt;<i>     for us to tag it as a particular kind of device
</I>
This is the normal case.

&gt;<i> As a concrete example, here's a ublox device on NetBSD:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> umodem0 at uhub1 port 2 configuration 1 interface 0
</I>&gt;<i> umodem0: u-blox AG ANTARIS(r) 4  -  GPS Receiver, rev 1.10/1.00, addr 2, iclass 2/2
</I>&gt;<i> umodem0: data interface 1, has CM over data, has no break
</I>&gt;<i> umodem0: status change notification available
</I>&gt;<i> ucom0 at umodem0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> umodem supports all CDC-ACM devices.  All of these get muxed into
</I>&gt;<i> ucom(4) which then appear as /dev/dtyU0, dtyU1, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean that to be 'usb'?  What behavior do you want to control?
</I>
Yes, that should type as USB.  The main behavior we want to control is
avoiding sending wakeup strings to USB and Bluetooth devices - they
don't necessarily take that well.
