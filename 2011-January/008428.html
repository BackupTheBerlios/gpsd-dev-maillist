<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Almanacs, agpsd, and the rest are already being talked about for inclusion.
</I>
Here is what we have extra beyond GPS support, and what is planned.
In all cases, the incremental complexity is quite well confined to a
single driver-level module and a few lines of switching/dispatch code.

* AIS support:  Working, in production use, regression tests in good shape.

* Subframe reporting: Work in progress, will have regression tests.

* NTRIP support:  Add-on by a contributor now gone, bugs in it
recently fixed by a production user so it's almost certainly working
now, no regression test.

* RTCM2 support: Not production tested as far as I know,  Has regression test.

* RTCM3 support: Work in progress, no regression test.

* Compass support: Working, with known minor bugs in unit scaling.  Has
regression tests.

* AGPS: Only speculation at this point, no code.

&gt;<i> &gt; Yes. Unavoidably so, given the hardware territory it has to cover just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to deliver basic GPS data. &#160;The newer stuff like AIS is only a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relatively small increment of complexity over what's irreducibly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required to do GPS right, given that we have a dozen vendor binary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols to cope with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is the small increments tend to collect into a big mess.
</I>
Yes, they do. Which is why I am fanatical about proper vertical separation
of layers in the architecture and proper horizontal separation of the driver
modules.  I am not a GPS domain expert, I am a systems architect; my response
to &quot;this could turn into a messy pile&quot; is to exercise design discipline
*so it doesn't*. 

I am a huge fan of the Unix philosophy of breaking big programs into
flocks of smaller cooperating programs - I wrote a well-received book
about that philosophy once.  But it can be overapplied. Breaking a
large program up into smaller binaries doen't help when, as in this
case, the data coupling among the binaries would necessarily be so
intricate that the marshalling and unmarshalling code to pass data
around exceeds the complexity of the internal interfaces in the
one-big-binary version.

&gt;<i> Suppressing something means it is still there and it really isn't
</I>&gt;<i> isolated if something in a driver breaks the build as a whole.
</I>
You're quite right. This is why we have flocktest, to perform build and
regression tests on multiple architectures.

&gt;<i> I don't know that this will happen, but I already have a large number
</I>&gt;<i> of different GPS units.  If the drivers are going to be vanilla NMEA,
</I>&gt;<i> they are already there.  If I want to add in all the special feature
</I>&gt;<i> support, it might start making it bigger.
</I>
By about 100K, yes.  This is the price we pay for autoconfiguration
at startup time.  I don't think 100K is a large price, and for those
who want to configure out the extras we support that.
 
&gt;<i> If the GPS covered by a binary driver can do NMEA, do we want to keep
</I>&gt;<i> the binary driver?  If so, then do we add specific drivers for
</I>&gt;<i> everyone?
</I>
Depends.  We add a binary driver when that allows us to get data NMEA
won't pass out; the most usual case is error estimates and 
dilution-of-precision figures.

&gt;<i> For that matter, lets say I have two GPS units - one is a very
</I>&gt;<i> sensitive precise WAAS enabled unit with a resolution of 1Hz, and a
</I>&gt;<i> second has basic data at 10Hz.  Can I get both?
</I>
Certainly.  Was there any reason you expected this to be a problem?

&gt;<i> The other way might be a JSON merge mechanism - so I could write
</I>&gt;<i> something to take data not supported by GPSD itself, send it into a
</I>&gt;<i> port, (be validated and tagged,) and it would appear in the event
</I>&gt;<i> stream.  You could even have some officially supported bits for the
</I>&gt;<i> interesting and useful but 4-sigma cases.
</I>
I have a design in my head for a way to use a master gpsd instance
to collect data from multiple slaves. This could easily be generalized
into such a merge facility.

&gt;<i> My most common application is to take vehicle performance data (OBD2
</I>&gt;<i> type info) and sensors (compass/gyro/accel) and merge that with GPS
</I>&gt;<i> information since it helps to know when and where something
</I>&gt;<i> interesting in the data happened.  So I tend to think of the problems
</I>&gt;<i> in that context.
</I>
One question I ask in this circumstance is whether there's a well-defined
public standard for streaming the special data over serial links.  If there
is, then it's at least possible we might want to put support in GPSD.

One reason for this criterion is that when it's fulfilled, it's usually
possible to build a decent regression test,
