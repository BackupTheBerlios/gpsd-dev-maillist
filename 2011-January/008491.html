<PRE><A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">f4eru at free.fr</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">f4eru at free.fr</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> In my opinion, all these methods are quite dangerous. As probably
</I>&gt;<i> only a handful of devices will fail, and the most critical ones are
</I>&gt;<i> those that are often ON, I think the most reliable is to detect a
</I>&gt;<i> step back &gt; 15 years, and only if the device type has not changed.
</I>
It's not just a handful of devices that will fail. Any given release
of GPS firmware can be designed to operate in at most two rollover
periods - from when it's issued to the next zero-counter event, and
from then to when the counter is at the second before its issue date
in the previous period.  If the vendor is stupid, the GPS will stop
reporting dates sooner than that - after the next zero-counter event.

*All* receivers will fail on their first cold-start outside this span, 
because they won't have the information needed to tell that they aren't 
starting up during a past week in their rollover period of origin.

Diego Berge&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at navlost.eu</A>&gt; suggests:
&gt;<i>    As an alternative, if your receiver outputs, and gpsd captures, the
</I>&gt;<i> UTC message (page 18.4 of the navigation message), you're in luck. In
</I>&gt;<i> such case you can use the leap seconds adjustment (&#916;tLS, &#916;tLSF)  to
</I>&gt;<i> either determine (by means of a lookup table) or estimate (by relying on
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that the Earth rotation rate is slowing down) the rough year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I haven't thought this through completely, but I think it should be
</I>&gt;<i> close enough to disambiguate adequately for the foreseeable future and
</I>&gt;<i> more deterministic than relying on the local clock, assuming you have
</I>&gt;<i> one at all. The disadvantage is that probably not all receivers output
</I>&gt;<i> the requisite information.
</I>
It is probably true that we could curve-fit the decline in Earth's
orbital speed to produce a function from leap-second count to a year
estimate.  That's a very clever idea.  But there's a problem with it.

The problem with is that the estimate wouldn't be accurate within
about two years - as we speak, it's January 2010 and the last leap
second was at the end of December 2008. In the future, that two-year
slop could easily put our estimate on the wrong side of a recent or
near-future week rollover from actual present time.

However, there's a variant of this idea I can and will use.  We know
the leap-second offsets for past times; if we have a leap-second
offset, we can at least check whether it's inconsistent with the year
the GPS is reporting. This will detect some rollovers.

So, for example, if the GPS reports it's 1985, but the current leap-second
offset is greater than 5 seconds, we can't say exactly what rollover
period we're in, but we can know for sure it isn't the right one and
log a rollover error.
