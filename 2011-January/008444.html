<PRE>Recent progresss on subframe reporting has been excellent. But there
are a couple of issues I'm concerned about remaining.  These questions
are mainly for Gary Miller.

1. Are we now reporting the complete set of subframes, or is there more
information still to be extracted?

2. I'm always concerned about numerical stability in reports of float
quantities. There are two problems here: (a) Repeatability for regression
testing, and (b) Lossless reporting for clients who would prefer to do
their own scaling in order to avoid (for example) issues with IEEE754 
conformance or the lack of it on their platform.  

In the AIS context I delt with this by supporting both scaled and
unscaled reporting. You can see how this works in the function
aivdm_json_dump(). Something similar should be implemented for 
subframe reporting.

3. The output JSON needs to be documented on the gpsd(8) manual page.  
Again, AIS provides a precedent; there, I pointed at the AIVDM Protocol
Decoding document and said to look for the member names listed in that.
The subframe documentation can point at IS-GPS-200E and give a rule
for correspondence of names.

4. Support in the client-side library. Now that we can ship JSON subframes 
up the pipe to a client, the client lib needs to be able to parse those
back into C structs.

Probably fewer than 2% of handguns and well under 1% of all guns will
ever be involved in a violent crime. Thus, the problem of criminal gun
violence is concentrated within a very small subset of gun owners,
indicating that gun control aimed at the general population faces a
serious needle-in-the-haystack problem.
