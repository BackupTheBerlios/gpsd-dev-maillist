<PRE>Olivier Mehani &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">olivier.mehani at inria.fr</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I attach a Quilt patchset with several patches addressing Greg's
</I>&gt;<i> points.
</I>
I have just spent about 30 minutes trying to apply these to gpsd trunk.
I'm sorry, but there has been too much change since 2.39 for these to 
apply anything even close to cleanly.  I would try to reconcile by hand,
but I don't understand the IPv6 API well enough to be sure I wouldn't
miss something subtle but critical.

I will be happy to merge in IPv6 support, but you will need to generate
a patch set against SVN trunk or (at leastt) our more recent 2.40 release.

A few comments:

Greg's objection is correct.  We don't like configuration options
here; our programs should look around in their environment and figure
out what to do without being told.
 
&gt;<i> Patch gpsd-2.39_ipv6_bsd-like_behavior.patch implements this feature for
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd only (not the utilities). Sock2id has been updated as well to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use sockaddr_in6 if needed.
</I>
A high-quality patchset should implement KAME/BSD-like autoconfiguring behavior
for all the network-aware tools

&gt;<i> I tried to go through the verification process as explained in [0], but
</I>&gt;<i> all test exited with errors, even on an unpatched tree, despite the
</I>&gt;<i> relevant tools being installed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I don't believe these patches introduce any regression with
</I>&gt;<i> respect to the GPS device handling, as the changes are only on the
</I>&gt;<i> network side.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Splint yields a lot of warnings suggesting to add +posix, both for the
</I>&gt;<i> patched and unpatched version. The patched version has two new warnings
</I>&gt;<i> (for libgps.c and gpsmon.c) about &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;. I'm not exactly sure
</I>&gt;<i> what this means, but the warning is similar to those from the vanilla
</I>&gt;<i> version, so my understanding is that they are considered harmless.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Valgrind audit complains about a missing killall() attribute for the
</I>&gt;<i> test session in both case. I didn't investigate further, but no memory
</I>&gt;<i> allocation has been changed, so it should be safe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I manually (i.e. not exhaustively) tested the patched version with
</I>&gt;<i> respect to behaving as before, using IPv6 by default and gracefully
</I>&gt;<i> falling back to IPv4. The configure script has only been tested on a
</I>&gt;<i> recent Unix with IPv6 support, but build tests were run with IPv6
</I>&gt;<i> enabled, disabled or autodetected. All tests worked as expected.
</I>
Good job of testing.  I wish all our contributors were so conscientious.
