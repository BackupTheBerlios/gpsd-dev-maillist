Hi Gary,

&gt;<i> It is not well tested and varies for unkown reasons. In 38400 the
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd init of the SiRF adds more messages, thus the non-obvious fudge
</I>&gt;<i> scaling.  There are also some side effects of the speed changing code
</I>&gt;<i> that I am tracking down.
</I>
I've also had time-lag problems with my sirf device when it is using low 
speeds, but have not looked deeper into it.  Would it be possible to 
similarly disable messages when it is runs at low speeds, such that one 
does not need to change the serial speed to make the times not off by 
whole seconds?

&gt;<i> Now that 2.90 is out, any tweaks you want to discuss again on the PPS?
</I>
I'll come back with the polling stuff when I've managed to clean it up a 
bit more.

The attached patch introduces checking of the duration for 0.5 Hz square 
waves.  I do not have any such device, but did get some false positives 
there on the wrong flank when I was working with the polling and some 
pulses got lost (an inherent problem for that one).  It can be worked 
around in other ways, but checking the duration also for this case puts it 
on equal footing with other ones.  However, I was (un)fortunately not able 
to reproduce the false positives without the polling stuff, even with a 
heavily loaded machine.  Even as I run without any nice adjustment.

&gt;<i> Gotta say that so far my PPS results have been really good.  Only thing
</I>&gt;<i> I am chasing is that SiRF leap seconds will go nuts now and again.  Doing
</I>&gt;<i> some testing for ways to speed convergence might show something valuable.
</I>
Yes, it has gotten really nice.  Have almost fully switched to using 
chrony as it simplifies testing a lot by not taking ages to fine-tune the 
system clock.

Cheers,
H&#229;kan
