</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I ran 'gmake distcheck' and ran into enough problems that I suspected it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wasn't a local platform issue.  So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Does 'make distcheck' work for anyone, on any platform?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It never has for me.  I tried to make it work once but FSF's
</I>&gt;<i> documentation of the prerequisites sucks.  I can't make &quot;make check&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> work either; same reason.
</I>
make check works for me, but it just builds the test drivers instead of
calling what 'make testregress' does like it should.  I just fixed that,
but it was of little consequence, and that's not what I'm taling about.

What make distcheck is suppposed to do is

  make a distribution tarball (presumably the tarballs that are
  distributed are produced this way?)

  unpack it

  create a build directory

  run configure from the unpacked dist in the build directory, to do an
  out-of-src build

  build

  do 'make check' to verify that the previous build passes regression tests

I think the problem is that out-of-srcdir builds fail.

&gt;<i> What's supposed to happen with both of these (I think) is that you
</I>&gt;<i> define some set of magic macros and helper productions and autofoo
</I>&gt;<i> supplies sequencing logic to knit them into tests.  But I've never
</I>&gt;<i> been able to figure out what I needed to do to make that happen, and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sufficiently fed up with the rest of autofoo to not want to
</I>&gt;<i> invest more time in it.
</I>
Turns out it was not that hard, but that was not obvious up front...

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Has anyone done a cross build?  I have set up cross builds (linux
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i386 host, linux arm11 target) of earlier versions, but not tried
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recently.  The addition of all the python stuff makes me nervous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have not.  ckuethe has - he ran into some floating-pont toolchain issues
</I>&gt;<i> and solved them, IIRC.
</I>
I will try that next.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Where is it written down what the expectations are for what works, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terms of builds with and without optional components, passing 'make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> check', and 'make distcheck', and the list of platforms which are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believed to be in good shape?  I think this belongs in or referenced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From HACKING.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean the Hacking Guide on the website or something else?  There
</I>&gt;<i> was a plain text file called HACKING in the distant past that the web
</I>&gt;<i> page was derived from, but it's way obsolete.  The color codes and the
</I>&gt;<i> re,lease procedure are on the webpage.
</I>
Given that one of the advantages talked about for distributed VCS is
working off the net, I think that belongs in the source tree, not on the
web, but that's not important.

&gt;<i> It is expected that 'make testegress' pass without errors.  We have a script,
</I>&gt;<i> devtools/regress-builder, that random samples the space of possible configs
</I>&gt;<i> amd test-builds to see if the compile breaks.  Since you seem to have
</I>&gt;<i> appointed yourself master of the build process, you should probably get
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with it and run it.
</I>
I am getting some test failures, on both NetBSD and linux, but most are
ok.  So I suspect there is either something wrong, or bad tests.

&gt;<i> That's correct, we're now in bug-fix only mode.
</I>
ok
