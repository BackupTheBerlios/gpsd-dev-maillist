<PRE>
I have not tested the code itself, this is just 'theoretical' 
considerations:

sin/cos are not at fault, but the algortihm as such for small distances.

Assume a distance b of 1 dm, then the 'normalized' dot product called a 
in the routine will have a value of approximately 1-b^2/R^2, R being the 
radius.  I.e. 1 - 2.46e-16, where 2.46e-16 is close to the epsilon of a 
double (2.22e-16).

For such small distances it should be much better to just use Pythagoras 
directly, i.e. evaluate

R = CalcRad((lat1+lat2)/2);
d = sqrt((x1-x2)*(x1-x2) + (y1-y2)*(y1-y2) + (z1-z2)*(z1-z2));
if (d &lt; 10000) // comment on this value below
   return d * (1 + (d/R)*(d/R) / 24);

a similar issue appears for points on opposite sides of the globe, where a 
is ~= -1.  acos(a) should then be close to pi and the result about 20000 
km, so the loss of accuracy of a dm should not matter.  but it makes no 
sense to return nans, rather do

if (a &lt; -1)
   a = -1;

before the final calculation.

The simple use a Pythagoras above sort of defies the fact the the earth is 
not flat.  If b is the distance along the surface and we call d the 
straight distance between the two points, and theta the angle between 
them (where a = cos (theta), approximately), we have:

b = R * theta
d = 2 * R * sin(theta / 2)

since  sin x = x - x^2/3! + x^5/5! + O(x^7)

and with theta = b/R we get

d = 2 * R * ((b/2R) - (b/2R)^2/3! + (b/2R)^5/5! + ...)

d = b - b^3/(2R)^2/3! + b^5/(2R)^4/5! + ...

now, to solve for b, set b=d for the correction terms:

b = d + d^3/(2R)^2/3! + d^5/(2R)^4/5! - ...

If we do not want an error larger than say 1e-8 in b (relative to d), then 
look for

d^3/(2R)^2/3!/d = 1e-8  ==&gt; d = 3.1 km

for the next term:

d^5/(2R)^4/5!/d = 1e-8  ==&gt; d = 421 km

b = d + d^3/R*2*2*3*2*1 = d + 1/24 * d^3/R^2

So I opted for a 10 km cut and applying a first term correction.  At d = 
10 km, a = 0.9999987 so I think the original should work.

Of course, one could probably skip the correction altogether, as a 
correction of 1e-8 on 10 km is just 1 mm...  :-)

--

Some further notes:

with such a cut, the routine will certainly not be continous.  would that 
matter?

I wrote 'normalized' dot product in the above as it divides not by the 
product of the two vector lengths, but some square of an 'average' of the 
two.

It's late night here, factors of 2 and 3 may easily be wrong.

Cheers,
H&#229;kan
