<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I ran 'gmake distcheck' and ran into enough problems that I suspected it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't a local platform issue.  So
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Does 'make distcheck' work for anyone, on any platform?
</I>
It never has for me.  I tried to make it work once but FSF's
documentation of the prerequisites sucks.  I can't make &quot;make check&quot;
work either; same reason.

What's supposed to happen with both of these (I think) is that you
define some set of magic macros and helper productions and autofoo
supplies sequencing logic to knit them into tests.  But I've never
been able to figure out what I needed to do to make that happen, and
I'm sufficiently fed up with the rest of autofoo to not want to
invest more time in it.

&gt;<i> 2) Has anyone done a cross build?  I have set up cross builds (linux
</I>&gt;<i> i386 host, linux arm11 target) of earlier versions, but not tried
</I>&gt;<i> recently.  The addition of all the python stuff makes me nervous.
</I>
I have not.  ckuethe has - he ran into some floating-pont toolchain issues
and solved them, IIRC.
 
&gt;<i> 3) Where is it written down what the expectations are for what works, in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of builds with and without optional components, passing 'make
</I>&gt;<i> check', and 'make distcheck', and the list of platforms which are
</I>&gt;<i> believed to be in good shape?  I think this belongs in or referenced
</I>&gt;<i> From HACKING.
</I>
Do you mean the Hacking Guide on the website or something else?  There
was a plain text file called HACKING in the distant past that the web
page was derived from, but it's way obsolete.  The color codes and the
re,lease procedure are on the webpage.

It is expected that 'make testegress' pass without errors.  We have a script,
devtools/regress-builder, that random samples the space of possible configs
amd test-builds to see if the compile breaks.  Since you seem to have
appointed yourself master of the build process, you should probably get
familiar with it and run it.

&gt;<i> 4) We have this release color code system, which also belongs in
</I>&gt;<i> HACKING, but that's not bothering me - I will almost certainly dissent
</I>&gt;<i> From the timelines :-).  I presume that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   it's ok to commit build fixes that seem safe
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   it's not ok to commit feature enhancements of any kind
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but that wasn't 100% clear to me.
</I>
That's correct, we're now in bug-fix only mode.
