<PRE>David Ludlow &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">dave at adsllc.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> It only affects sirf_write() directly, and in a pretty limited
</I>&gt;<i> fashion.  sirf_speed() and sirf_to_nmea() are affected because they
</I>&gt;<i> call sirt_write().  That's it.
</I>
I think there are analogous functions in other drivers, though.  Have
you checked?
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;G. The &quot;boolean&quot; token used by the JSON stuff is already defined in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Win32.  Renamed to &quot;booleanval&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Is it a macro or a typedef?  If a typedef, what Windows file supplies it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> rpcndr.h says &quot;typedef unsigned char boolean;&quot;, so a simple #ifdef
</I>&gt;<i> trick won't work.  rpcndr.h is included by wtypes.h, which is
</I>&gt;<i> required by winsock2.h.  I haven't looked to see if this is a
</I>&gt;<i> MinGW-ism or if it's how the &quot;native&quot; includes handle it.  If it's
</I>&gt;<i> MinGW specific, that would be the ideal place to fix it.
</I>
I think we can avoid the problem by being careful what includes are made where.
My 'boolean' token is used only in JSON parser machinery, and that's pretty
well separated from anywhere sockets are used.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;The largest issue I see is that porting to Windows would significantly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;complicate our test regime.  If we mainline the code, would you be willing to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;own it and do tests before each release?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't really looked into the testing aspect, which is obviously
</I>&gt;<i> of huge importance.  The good news is that the whole build &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> packaging process runs on Fedora, so much testing can be automated
</I>&gt;<i> by normal means and without a lot of physical or logical
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure.  I'd like to know more about what sort of testing
</I>&gt;<i> you're looking for before I overcommit, but I suspect that we can
</I>&gt;<i> work it out.
</I>
The GPSD distribution contains a regression-test harness written in Python.
Most of what you'd need to do is port that so it runs under Windows, then
run it before each release so we can verify that nothing has come unstuck.
 
&gt;<i> I know that you won't be surprised to hear that I didn't just wake
</I>&gt;<i> up one morning and decide to do this.  I'm working on a MinGW port
</I>&gt;<i> of an aviation charting program (vifir) with GPS support and this
</I>&gt;<i> was better than reinventing the wheel, so client apps are my end
</I>&gt;<i> goal.  The MinGW system built into Fedora makes this pretty trivial
</I>&gt;<i> using normal autotools routines.  Since gpspipe.exe is already
</I>&gt;<i> working as a dynamic executable, this is already solved by
</I>&gt;<i> definition.
</I>
That's good.  You just raised the chances that we'll actually integrate
this substantially.
