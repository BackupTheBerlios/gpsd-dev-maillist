<PRE>David Ludlow &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">davel at adsllc.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I've spent the last few days working on a MinGW port of the gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> package.  I've made pretty good progress and have a somewhat functional
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.exe and gpspipe.exe, as tested on Wine and WinXP.  The code is
</I>&gt;<i> based on the gpsd-2.90 release.
</I>
Interesting.

I'm the project lead and will make the go/no-go deciosion on this,
though my lieutenants (Chris Kuethe and Gary Miller) will have a say.

&gt;<i> The applicable files are available here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://adsllc.fedorapeople.org/gpsd-2.90-mingw/">http://adsllc.fedorapeople.org/gpsd-2.90-mingw/</A>
</I>
I've downloaded them and skimmed the patch.  It doesn't look too bad.

&gt;<i> It's clearly not a finished product, and is probably broken in many
</I>&gt;<i> ways, but it's a start.  I'd like to get opinions on the structure of
</I>&gt;<i> things before I do much more polishing &amp; fixing.
</I>
Some of your changes look like code cleanups that would be worthwhile
even for the Unix home port. I have in mind, for example, getting rid of
u_char and maybe using socket_t.  Let's merge those first and see how
small we can make the patch before we have to start doing things that
are ugly.

&gt;<i> The basic summary of the changes are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A. Added win32_compat.* files to compartmentalize as much as possible. 
</I>&gt;<i> There are still many empty stubs here.
</I>&gt;<i> B. Update a bunch of #include stuff to make step A work.
</I>&gt;<i> C. Added a serial_win32.c file that is used instead of serial.c as
</I>&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>
All pretty unobjectionable.

&gt;<i> D. Sped up the select() timeout in the main loop on Win32.
</I>
That's going to need more careful review than I've given it yet, but is
probably OK.

&gt;<i> E. Added a conditional gps_handle to gps_data_t.
</I>
No problem.

&gt;<i> F. Passed the whole gps_data_t* structure in some places instead of just
</I>&gt;<i> the fd so gps_handle would be available.
</I>
That starts to get ugly and will need careful review.

&gt;<i> G. The &quot;boolean&quot; token used by the JSON stuff is already defined in
</I>&gt;<i> Win32.  Renamed to &quot;booleanval&quot;.
</I>
Is it a macro or a typedef?  If a typedef, what Windows file supplies it?

&gt;<i> H. Created a socket_t that is a SOCKET on Win32 and an int otherwise.
</I>
I might take that change even if we don't finish the Windows port.  
I'm in favor of using type declarations as documentation of semantic kinds.

&gt;<i> I. Added NSIS installer support.
</I>
I have no idea what NSIS is.

&gt;<i> I'm looking for:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Advice on structural changes I can make to improve the odds of
</I>&gt;<i> mainline integration.
</I>
You've got the beginnings of that above.

&gt;<i> 2. Advice on the Win32 API code, as that's not my speciality. 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, there's really very little of it.
</I>
I don't think any our refgular is a Win32 person.  You may
be out of luck there. 

&gt;<i> 3. Other interested parties.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Other thoughts and opinions.
</I>
The largest issue I see is that porting to Windows would significantly
complicate our test regime.  If we mainline the code, would you be willing to
own it and do tests before each release?

There's also the library code to worry about. That is, what it would take
to make libgps available to client Windows applications.
