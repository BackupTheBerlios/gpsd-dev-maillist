<PRE>Hi all,

Based on Mathieu's initial patch, I integrated Greg's comments.

I attach a Quilt patchset with several patches addressing Greg's
points.

First, Mathieu's patch ported to 2.39 is in
gpsd-2.39_ipv6_support.patch. It serves as the basis for further
modifications. Their specifics are given below, in response to Greg's
comments.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, I think we need to talk about what the desired behavior is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am used to the KAME/BSD approach to v6, which is that programs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that used to listen on a v4 socket should instead listen on both v6
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and v4 and be able to cope with incoming connections on either.  For
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, one of my machines runs DNS, and fstat shows:
</I>
Patch gpsd-2.39_ipv6_bsd-like_behavior.patch implements this feature for
gpsd only (not the utilities). Sock2id has been updated as well to be
able to use sockaddr_in6 if needed.

&gt;<i> &gt; I think listening on v6 should be the default for systems that have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; v6 support (via .h files, separate from 'a global v6 address is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configured').  It's ok to have an option for 'listen only on v4' and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'listen only on v6' - but I'm not sure it's really needed.
</I>
The -4 and -6 options for gpsd are impemented in patch
gpsd-2.39_ipv6_af_selection_options.patch. This patch can safely be
skipped if desired.

&gt;<i> &gt; When given a name (with 'localhost' being the implicit name), cgps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc. should use getaddrinfo (if it exists), and then use the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AF/address returned, which will typically be v6.  For example: I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would say that if netlib_ takes names, then it should perhaps just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use getaddrinfo, and perhaps should take an AF_ variable to force
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only a specific family so -4 and -6 command line args can be given
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in case of trouble (as ntpq and ssh do).  Sockets already defines
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AF_INET and AF_INET6, so IMHO best to use those rather than define
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new constants.
</I>
This is taken care of in gpsd-2.39_utils_ipv6_bsd-like_behavior.patch
which updates netlib_connectsock (and its prototype) and replaces every
instance of 127.0.0.1 by localhost. 

Currently, it is not possible to specify an colon-separated IPv6 address
(only a host name or and dot-separated IPv4 address) as the colon is
used (at least for gpsmon) as the host/port separator. The parser would
need to be extended to support e.g. [colon:separated:ipv6:address]:port.

Additionally, a -4/-6 command line flag for these utils still remains to
be implemented.

&gt;<i> &gt; I think gpsd runs on some systems which are too lame to have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getaddrinfo, so autoconf support is needed.  getaddrinfo is in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; POSIX.1 2004:
</I>
The last patch, gpsd-2.39_ipv6_autoconf.patch, implements this, and adds
the relevant #ifdefs in the source code.


For more detailed description of each patch, please refer to their
header.


I tried to go through the verification process as explained in [0], but
all test exited with errors, even on an unpatched tree, despite the
relevant tools being installed.

However, I don't believe these patches introduce any regression with
respect to the GPS device handling, as the changes are only on the
network side.

Splint yields a lot of warnings suggesting to add +posix, both for the
patched and unpatched version. The patched version has two new warnings
(for libgps.c and gpsmon.c) about &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;. I'm not exactly sure
what this means, but the warning is similar to those from the vanilla
version, so my understanding is that they are considered harmless.

The Valgrind audit complains about a missing killall() attribute for the
test session in both case. I didn't investigate further, but no memory
allocation has been changed, so it should be safe.


I manually (i.e. not exhaustively) tested the patched version with
respect to behaving as before, using IPv6 by default and gracefully
falling back to IPv4. The configure script has only been tested on a
recent Unix with IPv6 support, but build tests were run with IPv6
enabled, disabled or autodetected. All tests worked as expected.


Hope this helps (:
