<PRE>Those of you following the commit list will have noticed a flurry of
changes to the gpsd core code recently.  It occurred to me this
afternoon that I should explain what I'm doing, because it's not a
good thing that I still seem to be the only person who really
understands the part of the architecture I'm modifying.

0. Prerequisites

To understand what follows, you have to remember that GPSes have
reporting cycles.  Start of cycle is when the firmware computer a fix.
It then ships a burst of sentences reporting the fix.  Wait a bit -
usually 1 second - and repeat.  This becomes an issue because when
your device speaks NMEA 0183 you have to aggregate reports from all
the sentences in a reporting cycle to get a complete fix.

You also need to know that the part of the code I'm modifying is the
dispatcher layer.  This is where the daemon's main select loop lives,
waiting on input from client sessions, active GPSes, and the special
control port.  The dispatcher allocates and deallocates sockets for
the client sessions and the control port, and handles user commands. It
calls the packet sniffer to accumulate traffic from the GPSes into
packets that can be analyzes for fixes, applies some policy and error
modeling, and ships treports to client sessions.

To do these things, the dispatcher calls out to a core library that
assembles packets and a bunch of drivers to analyze them once
assembled.  The details of that level aren't important for this
discussion.  What's mainly significant here is the fact that they're
separated from the dispatcher logic by an API I was pretty careful
about designing.

1. The motivation: bring back polling

The modifications I'm doing have been triggered by Chris Kuethe's
request that I bring back support for client-initiated polling in the
new JSON-based protocol.  At the moment, all clients are expected to
set watcher mode, then poll their socket often enough to handle the bursts
of time-position-velocity JSON that gpsd will send at them once per
cycle.

The original gpsd protocol was polling based, but had significant
design defects. One of them was that it was normal to poll for a bunch
of partial reports (latitude/longitude, altitude, speed, etc.) but
they weren't timestamped, so it wasn't easy to tell when the data was
stale.

There were also some unpleasant edge cases arising from the fact that,
in order to conserve power on battery-driven devices, the daemon
didn't try to activate any attached device until you polled for
position data.  Thus, you couldn't actually do a single-shot poll
reliably under old protocol - first time you tried it would wake up
some device but return no data, and you would probably start getting
good data on the second or third poll (depending on the timning of the
next cycle edge).

There were other problems as well, and I eventually gave up on
client-initiated polling entirely; when I redesigned the client API
for use with the new protocol, I left it out.

Chris has a decent use case for it, though, and I'm aiming towards
bringing it back.  The way it will probably work is that the
client starts by setting a ?WATCH that doesn't do the once-per-cycle
JSON bursts, but just clues the daemon to activate devices.
Thereafter the client will be able to poll for the state of the
cache from the last fix(es) - that's more than one if there are
multiple sensors attached.

2. Clearing the way

But there's major work needed to prepare the ground.  The good news is
that it's entirely in the dispatcher layer and the core library, and
won't destabilize the packet sniffer or the device drivers.  Changes
in that lower layer are *messy* and I approach them with trepidation.

Basically, before I can re-implement client polling in a clean way I
need to clear away a lot of scar tissue and complexity.  I ripped out
the command interpreter for old protocol weeks ago, but there's stuff
underneath the new one that's pretty tangled.  Most (but not all) of
it is a result of the infamous - and now dead - J command.

Those of you who have been around for a while will remember that old
protocol used to have a per-user-session policy switch controlling the
circumstances under which old data was held over and merged into new
data; you could have display-jitter reduction at the risk of
occasionally seeing stale data from the previous reporting cycle, or
you could guarantee fresh data only but pay for it with display
jitter.  

The reason J was needed was that the sentence mix shipped by
NMEA devices is highly variable, and we didn't have a reliable way to
pin down the end of cycle - users had to know about their devices
and choose the right policy.  I was never happy with this, because
zero configuration is one my goals, but that UI issue was nearly trivial
compared to the complexifying effect on the dispatcher internals.

Because the J policy switch was per user, you could have user sessions
with opposite smoothing policies (minimize jitter vs. avoid
staleness) getting data from the same underlying device.  Several
steps of implication later, this meant the dispatcher layer had to
maintain a pair of this-fix and last-fix buffers per client session,
copy data up into them from the device-driver layer, and apply
some policy-specific logic before emitting an actual report.

Eventually I figured how to do automatic end-of-cycle detection and
the J command went away. But the tricky buffer-shuffling used to
implement it didn't!  I knew I'd have to clean that up someday, but
didn't want to tackle that sooner than I had to.  I knew it would require
major surgery on the dispatcher.

When Chris made his request, though, I decided that it would be
begging for obscure bugs to reimplement polling on top of the
user-session-level buffering, and concluded that I needed to rip the
latter out first.

One of the hard parts is already done. There still needs to be a
buffer pair (this fix and last fix) for things like computing speed
and course if the GPS doesn't supply them.  But it can be per-device
and live in the core library rather than per-user-session and in the
dispatcher.  I successfully dropped those buffers down a level a
couple of days ago; as a happy side effect, this has already reduced
gpsd's memory footprint some.

What I'm working on now is getting rid of the channel structure. Under
old protocol client sessions listened to a specific list of devices;
under new protocol they listen to everything unless they've selected
a *single* device. The difference means that the channel structure array,
which exists to manage (potentially multiple) subscriber-to-device
links, isn't really needed anymore

Once I abolish channels I'll have a clean, fairly simple dispatcher
architecture that's matched to the way new protocol actually works.
That will be a good base on which to re-implement polling.

3. Removing code is good

One very nice thing about the work I'm doing is that it's mostly
ripping out chunks of code that aren't needed anymore, with some
refactoring to separate out those chunks first.  While it's possible
to introduce bugs during code removal, they tend to be the unsubtle
kind that lead to immediate crashes or gross regression-test failures.
It's thus relatively easy to have confidence in the results when I
take a step forward in the process.

The line count, memory usage, and overall complexity of the dispatcher
is going to drop significantly even after I have re-implemented
polling.  Polling will be handled by a relatively small, contiguous
span of code in the command interpreter that raids the device-level
buffers to generate a report; the removed code, by contrast, will have
been from all through the dispatcher, especially the grottier parts
that kept data tructures with different roles in proper synchrony.

This is all good.  Decreased line count means increased
maintainability, and given the high reliability requirements of
something that's going to be used in navigational systems (and thus
potentially life-critical) that's especially important for gpsd.
