To pick this thread up from about a week ago:

</I>
To answer the question of what I'm advocating:  The nmea_phrase[] is an 
array of structs, each struct contains elements which contain the 
sentence name, the number of fields, and a pointer to a decoder 
function.  There are about a dozen or so decoder functions, one for each 
type of NMEA sentence, each coded separately.  The decoder function is 
passed a count of fields, the fields as an array of strings, and a 
pointer to the current session object into which to decode the fields.

I would create one generic decoder function which had the same prototype 
as the decoder functions that already existed, but also obtained (by a 
configuration object lookup or as an additional parameter) an array of 
pointers to the actual fields within the session object (I have to admit 
I'm not sure how I'd generate those), and an equivalent array of field 
types.

That would then loop over the array of fields, and for each field would 
simply decode that field from a string into the appropriate field object 
and poke that into the session object using the matching pointer that it 
had obtained.  I may need a set of decoder functions, such as one to 
decode a latitude, one to decode a speed in knots, one to decode a 
temperature, etc.

The reason for doing this is to reduce the number of decoder functions. 
  Otherwise to decode the 20 or so sentences that deal with non-TPV data 
would require 20 or so additional decoder functions.  Most of those 
functions would take similar data from different positions in the NMEA 
sentence and do similar things with it.  e.g. the IIVWR and IIMWV 
sentences contain roughly similar (or at least overlapping) data in a 
different order, so there would be a certain amount of code repetition 
between a processVWR function and processMWV function.

Anyway, I understand we're in pre-2.91 code freeze so I'm not touching 
anything for the time being, just drafting up some design ideas, and in 
any case I'm in the midst of doing some software testing on another 
project so I won't have time to touch it for a few weeks, but that gives 
you an idea of what I'm thinking.
