<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I don't know, but probably I can fix it.  auto* isn't quite as
</I>&gt;<i> mysterious if you don't approach it with so much hate :-)
</I>
Once upon a time, I did not hate autotools. Yea verily, it was the
morning of the world and all things (even autotools) seemed fresh and
new).  I'd say this innocence lasted until about, oh, 1995.

But autotools was a kluge.  And it did accrete kluges and crocks
around it, adding layers of complexity until it became sore difficult
to tell which end was up.  And lo, it became a festering pile of
special cases and obscure semi-documented rules, leading to a
combinatorial explosion of unplanned interactions and obscure lossage.

Like, say, the fact that our make check insists on running gps-makeregress 
twice and in spite of being a genuine autotools *expert* with *fifteen
years* of experience bear-wrestling the sorry fscker *I cannot figure 
out why it is doing this*. 

Oh, there's a reason, all right.  And if I were willing to quintuple the
three hours I just spent poking at our build setup I'm sure I could
find it.  But that was three hours *wasted* as far as solving any real
problem was concerned. Life is too short for such nonsense.

Autotools has reached the Chandrasekhar mass limit of software and
become a black hole of suck that consumes endless hours of bright
peoples' time without any good result. It is well past time for it to die.
