<PRE>The new version of your Qt patch is much less intrusive, which is good.
Here's what I saw when I attempted to apply it

patching file configure.ac
patching file gps.h
patching file gps_json.h
patching file gpsd.h-tail
patching file gpsutils.c
patching file json.h
patching file libQgpsmm.pro
patching file libQgpsmm_global.h
The next patch would create the file ais_json.i,
which already exists!  Assume -R? [n] n
Apply anyway? [n] n
Skipping patch.
1 out of 1 hunk ignored -- saving rejects to file ais_json.i.rej
The next patch would create the file gpsd_config.h,
which already exists!  Assume -R? [n] n
Apply anyway? [n] n
Skipping patch.
1 out of 1 hunk ignored -- saving rejects to file gpsd_config.h.rej
patching file libgps_core.c
Hunk #3 FAILED at 47.
1 out of 15 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file libgps_core.c.rej
patching file libgpsmm.h

The libgps_core.c rejection was easily resolved; it doubled the size of the
privdata buffer, which I had previously done separately as a response to
Berlios bug #17034.  I'm guessing the *.i diffs were due to a line-ending
problem; if they are actually needed, please advise.

This patch requires documentation in the INSTALL file.  Please write a note
explaining:

1. What the target environments are (Linux? Windows? Both) 
2. Any build prerequisites (C++ compiler?  Qt library? Other libraries?)
3. What the new files libQgpsmm_global.h and libQgpsmm.pro are for,
   and how the are used.

I also need to know how to regression-test this code under Linux so
we can verify that it's not broken as the client library evolves.

troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left
to irresponsible action.&quot;
