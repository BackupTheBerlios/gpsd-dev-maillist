<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Now that we're using git (or maybe anyway - it's not like svn didn't
</I>&gt;<i> have branching support), we should take advantage of branches, and put
</I>&gt;<i> new features like this in a branch so they can be tested for lack of
</I>&gt;<i> regressions on more platforms before being put in master.  Problems are
</I>&gt;<i> likely easily fixable, but I think master should be a little more stable
</I>&gt;<i> than it is.
</I>
I am sympathetic to this argument.  But, for reasons which are specific
to this project, I'm inclined to reject it *on this project*. 

Here's why: gpsd is unusually tractable to automated testing. It has
no UI in the normal sense.  It performs a deterministic transform from
a set of serial data streams (GPS reports) to an output (reports
emitted to a client).

Nobody here can have avoided noticing that I've put an enormous amount
of effort into our verification tools. We have a large, effective 
regression-test suite and exceptionally good facilities for strapping
gpsd into a test jig and torturing it in a controlled environment. 

I spent the effort to build these precisely because they permit us
to verify gpsd over a much larger percentage of its state space than
would be the case for (say) a word processor or a game.

When Greg says &quot;I think master should be a little more stable than it
is.&quot;  what I hear is &quot;I want to have confidence that we're not
breaking stuff in what we ship; a slower, more controlled rate of
change would give me that confidence.&quot;

The evidence of his work and craftsmanship on this project says to me
that Greg is a wise man and a mature, capable developer; I nod
respectfully at this advice. *But*, I'm exploring a different
strategy. Mine is: &quot;I have confidence in the software because the
tests work&quot;.

If we were shipping a game or a word processor this would be a
dangerously naive position, because the state space of programs
like that is hugely more complex and a lot of it is inaccessible
to automated testing.

But we aren't.  Which means we can to a significant extent *substitute*
automated testing for other sorts of QA practice.  And my inclination
is to do exactly that, as hard as possible.
