<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I see your point, but the other side of the coin is that part of the
</I>&gt;<i> reason for complexity is the tremendous amount of mess that it has to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with.
</I>
That excuse dosn't satisfy me anymore, because: in the wake of C99 and
widespread SuS adoption, the portability issues autotools was designed
to cope with are significantly simpler than they used to be.  Fess up;
how many years since *you've* seen a Eunice installation or an HP3000?
The days when you had to (say) mine for vendor-specific variant system
headers are gone.

And yet, autotools has not gotten leaner to fit today's problems.
Instead it has bloated horribly. No, the problem here isn't &quot;the
complexity it had to deal with&quot;, it was initial design decisions that
scaled badly.  Like building the whole thing in a bastard mix of m4
and shell *shudder* - even Perl would have been a better choice.

&gt;<i>          I remain unconvinced that the proposed replacements really
</I>&gt;<i> solve as many portability issues.
</I>
I think I've mentioned before that scons on Battle For Wesnoth has
been a big win, significant because that's a rather large project with
complex dependencies and multiple platform targets including Windows
and Mac.

&gt;<i> I'll see if I can fix this..
</I>
Thanks.
