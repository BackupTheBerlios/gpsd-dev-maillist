<PRE>Hi!

Here are just a few ideas from me on how git could be used (and how not), might
make sense to discuss such things before people start to make a mess :)

- Add a script which pushes to github and similar pages regulary, thats an easy
and cheap backup (and safe due to the checksums git uses) and it also allows
other peopel to clone the codebase easily to add their changes and ask to pull them.

- Provide &quot;stable&quot; branches, similar to what the kernel developers do. For
distributions like Debian it is important to be able to update packages in case
of important bugs easily. And it makes things much more easy for packagers if
such bugfixes are available in the upstream's repository. Otherwise you have to
find the right commits, pick them onto the older code base

- Never allow to push non-fast-forwards. Otherwise it will be a PITA to use for
others.

- Use signed tags to make sure they're not modified.

- Please write proper commit messages: A short summary in the first line, then
one empty line, then the long description. Recent vim installations should have
a proper syntax highlighting for it. Makes it much more easy if you want to
create patches from them - or just want to have a look at the shortlog.

- Should commits have a Signed-off-by: line - at least when they're not from
developers who have direct commit access to the repository? I'd recommend that
to be ableto figure out who sent the patch (and probably owns the copyright on
it or whatever).

- Add proper commit hooks, at least to send commit diffs. There are hooks for
various tasks, including rejecting commits for various reasons. Wondering if we
have reasons to reject commits - probably for a missing proper log message? Not
sure.

That is all that comes into my mind for now, maybe some more later.

Cheers,

Bernd
