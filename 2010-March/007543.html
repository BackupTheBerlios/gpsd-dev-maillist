</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, all mingw systems ARE the same. The windows platform as a whole

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if they are the same, the prebuilt nature doesn't really hurt.

</I>&gt;<i> It seems less icky to me to have a cached pre-built file in git than the

</I>&gt;<i> Part of what we're running into is a cultural issue where some people

</I>&gt;<i> (because it doesn't implement POSIX, presumably) rather than an auto*
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  And then the other cultural issue of people spending their
</I>&gt;<i> time working on free not being inclined to accept any negatives from

</I>&gt;<i>

IMHO, we, as open-source developers, should make the distinction between
free software and free OS. It's like the common confusion between GNU and
linux.

I am developing software for the good of as many people as possible, giving
them alternatives to closed software. gpsd can basically be ran on any OS
supporting serial communication so why not make good use of it? The api used
to access the serial ports is just a detail and so should be the build
system.

Linux is an open, free OS. Great. Now I'm not a kernel hacker.  I'm
developing a free, cross-platform, software, Merkaartor, which allows to
edit Openstreetmap data, itself an OS agnostic open project.

Honestly the &quot;No, we don't support Windows &#8212; get a better operating system.&quot;
phrase on the gpsd homepage hurts me. This is, IMHO, a statement based on
personal feelings with no facts behind...
The windows platform will be as open as the number of open software running
on it.

But back to the topic. There is no good or bad, let's just try to find
solutions
