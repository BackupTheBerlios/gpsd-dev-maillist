That's what I meant to say.

</I>&gt;<i> Actually, all mingw systems ARE the same. The windows platform as a whole

</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, what would be your proposed alternative to generate the

</I>
So if they are the same, the prebuilt nature doesn't really hurt.

It seems less icky to me to have a cached pre-built file in git than the
switch build systems.

Part of what we're running into is a cultural issue where some people
see our current build system not running on mingw as a mingw problem
(because it doesn't implement POSIX, presumably) rather than an auto*
problem.  And then the other cultural issue of people spending their
time working on free not being inclined to accept any negatives from
supporting non-free operating systems.  (I'm not trying to say what
you're doing is wrong in any way, and I could see myself finding it
useful in a work context some day.)  Probably the above is obvious to
all, but I thought I'd say it because it definitely influences my
notions of what's reaosnable to do.
