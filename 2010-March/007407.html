  I think master *is* the stable branch.  If we need to create an
  unstable later, fine, but I don''t think anyone has plans for
  destabizing changes in the foreseeable future.

disconnect here...

master is the head of development.  It is high quality for what it is.

Stable branch would be e.g.:

  tag 0.95 release
  create branch at that same point

  hack on master towards 0.96

  bad bug found in 0.95 (e.g. security, just needs a check/abort added)

  make fix on 0.95 branch

  release 0.95.1 and tag it

There's probably no reason to actually make the branch; having the tag
is good enough, and there's no reason to say we'll usually do this; it's
something we could do in svn.


But there's another notion in git culture, which is that all changes go
on a topic branch before being merged to master - and perhaps there is a
requirement to pass make check on multiple platforms before merging, so
master is almost always ok.

I don't think we're having a real problem in that area, in that things
that break the build on BSD aren't any more likely to have been tested
in topic branches than when I get around to testing svn trunk tip, and
they've been easy to fix.
