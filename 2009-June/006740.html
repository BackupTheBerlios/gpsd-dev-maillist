<PRE>I modified the 2.39 code to accept a second /r as an NMEA_RECOGNIZED due to
a problem with a Jackson-labs Firefly-1a. The Firefly-1a is now working with
gpsd flawlessly. The issue was that the Firefly-1a was returning /r/r/n at
the end of each of its NMEA strings which would cause a great deal of havoc.
This was because the 2nd /r would cause it to return to ground and the code
would decide to do a character discard on the after the /n. So not only did
I lose /n, I was losing the $ of the next NMEA string. adding the code to
accept the /r as an NMEA recognized did the trick. To have gone with
allowing it to carry forward the /r as a NMEA_CR would have caused problems
with the buffer counters in the checksum verification code.
Here is the code snippet I changed:

    case NMEA_LEADER_END:
        if (c == '\r')
            lexer-&gt;state = NMEA_CR;
        else if (c == '$')
            /* faster recovery from missing sentence trailers */
            lexer-&gt;state = NMEA_DOLLAR;
        else if (!isprint(c))
            lexer-&gt;state = GROUND_STATE;
        break;
    case NMEA_CR:
*        if (c == '\r')
            lexer-&gt;state = NMEA_RECOGNIZED;
        else* if (c == '\n')
            lexer-&gt;state = NMEA_RECOGNIZED;
        else
            lexer-&gt;state = GROUND_STATE;
        break;

Hope this helps someone else.
