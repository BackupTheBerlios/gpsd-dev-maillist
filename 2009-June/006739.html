Lukasz Stelmach &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">stlman at poczta.fm</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Of course, neither GNOME requires it. It is all about scanning for
</I>&gt;<i> nearby devices, presenting a list and asking users to chose a device.
</I>&gt;<i> It won't probably be a bad call to assume cli users can follow the
</I>&gt;<i> old path with pencil-and-paper while those who can't make it most
</I>&gt;<i> probably have an environment that provides BT GUI (e.g. gnome-bluetooth).
</I>
That does seem like a reasonable assumption.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; [*] Since there is no act of putting a plug into a socket with BT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; devices it is not possible to run automatic detection. It is *always*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a computer that initiates a connection to such simple devices like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; GPS receivers. So it has to know what it is trying to connect to.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; All the PDAs I have seen have some interface to find and select
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the device you would use later on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That means, I think, that we need to write some little tool that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; starts gpsd (if necessary) and pokes a command down its control 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; port to tell it that it has a Bluetooth device in its pool.  For
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the sake of discussion let's call it &quot;gpsattach&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd rather it was able to do the detecion on its own and pass the results
</I>&gt;<i> to gpsd, which most probably was started at boot time. This way it seems
</I>&gt;<i> easier to avoid many problems with permisions and such.
</I>
gpsd is not in fact normally started at boot time, at least not on
udev-capable Linux systems.  Rather, it is launched by a script run by
udev when a USB device hotplug event occurs.  This script sends the
name of the USB device down the gpsd control channel; gpsd then samples
the data from the device to see if it's acctually a GPS, closing it if
it is not.

I wonder if we could recruit udev to do our Bluetooth wakeup for us.  The
scenario I'm imagining is this: 

1. User (or gpsd package installation) tweaks /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf
so that when he activates his Bluetooth GPS with bluegnome or whatever, 
it gets bound to a device named btgps0, rather than the generic rfcomm0.

2. We write a udev rule that detects btgps0 going active and hands it
to gpsd.hotplug.wrapper just as though it were a wired USB device.

This way we wouldn't have to write gpsattach or anything equivalent,
and gpsd would not need to know anything special about Blurtooth devices.

On a related topic: Adorian Ardelean got Bluetooth working using information
from this blog entry:

<A HREF="http://blogs.srijan.in/2008/01/19/bluetooth-gps-devices-with-linux/">http://blogs.srijan.in/2008/01/19/bluetooth-gps-devices-with-linux/</A>

Some things I read in there suggested that portions of ou bluetooth
instructions at &lt;<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/bt.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/bt.html</A>&gt; may be out-of-date -
in particular, one of the commenters claims bluz is obsolete and not
needed.  Would you please look at that page and ship me a patch
updating it?
