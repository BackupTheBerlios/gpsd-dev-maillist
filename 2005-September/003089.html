Thats at least mildly encouraging.

I'm not getting a really warm fuzzy from usglobalsat support.  After
making me jump through a million hoops just to ask support a question
on their web form they ignore all the information they asked for and
1) request I load an *.exe into openbsd-current to turn on the
non-existent WAAS support for the bu-353, 2) tell me to contact my
software vendor to ask why their msg-41 is broken with respect to the
heading information 3) they closed the ticket.  Sigh.  And it isn't
even a Monday...
