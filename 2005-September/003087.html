<PRE>Should we think about a 2.31 release soon? Cgps has been tidied up
some, and we now have a lightweight gpx logger. I think there were
some issues regarding speed output and what units to use, but I don't
recall seeing a resolution to that...

Does anyone else have any bugs or tweaks? The list has been pretty
quiet - i'll take that as a sign that things aren't hoplessly broken.

I've spoken to SiRF and apparently the SS3 flash procedure is the same
as that for SS2. Yay.  Re-pinged my contacts about distributing loader
and firmware images - they've got no word yet from the legal
department.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
