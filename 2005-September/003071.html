<PRE>  Before I attempt a patch, I want to verify my sanity.  My
understanding is that the NMEA-0183 standard says that the GPRMC
sentence reports speed in knots.  When I use the 'r' command with gpsd
to get NMEA data, the speed field in the GPRMC sentences comes out
wrong (ie, when I convert from knots to MPH, the number is nowhere
near what my speedometer says).  On a hunch, I converted from
Meters/sec to MPH instead, and viola, the number now looks correct.  I
just now got home and looked at the gpsd code, and I see that the
GPRMC sentence gets constructed in lines 261 to 278 of libgpsd_core.c,
and uses the 'session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.speed' for the speed field.
According to gps.h line 65, that field is Meters/second, not knots.
Is this a bug, or do I misunderstand the code, or is my information
about the NMEA GPRMC sentence wrong?  If it's a bug, it's a one-line
fix (ie, multiply by the MS--&gt;KNOTS constant).  Whatever it is, it's
inconsistent with the GPRMC sentences produced by my Garmin receivers.
All of them produce sane speeds when you assume the GPRMC speed is in
knots.

  This leads to a second thought.  If this is a bug, I've got a metric
buttload of archived data with errors.  I can write a script to go
through the files and fix the errors easily enough (it's easy enough
to identify when I stopped archiving raw NMEA data and started
archiving the output of the gpsd 'r' command instead), however, with
future bugs, this may not be so simple.  My trusty ol' Garmin GPS16
embeds the following line every sixty (?) seconds in the NMEA stream:

$PGRMT,GPS 16-HVS Ver. 2.30,P,P,R,R,P,,30,R*02

  I forget what all of the fields are, but the obvious important one
is a firmware version number.  How about a 'PGPSD' sentence thrown
into the stream at sixty second intervals that contains a version
number?  Knowing what version of gpsd produced your data would sure
make it easier to clean up after any future bugs (assuming anyone in
the world besides me logs their gps data).  I believe the NMEA
standard allows vendor-specific strings that start with &quot;PG&quot;.
Equipment that does not understand these strings (supposedly) ignores
them.  I'd be willing to attempt a patch if the idea sounds
acceptable.
