Indeed, there is no urgency. Everything more-or-less works like we
want it to. I'm just thinking that once we get this latest round of
patches vetted, we may want to bundle it up as 2.31- the &quot;Smooth,
Sophisticated Flavour&quot; release...

Then we can start on with new stuff. I like what Jeff has done with
cgps, and my gpx logger clears another item off the list of things
that would be nice to have. I don't know if'n'when we'll get
permission to distribute flash images, which makes that an unrealistic
milestone for setting a date for the next release.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
