My perl toolkit can enable WAAS if it's supported in the firmware.

I'm going to be opening a ticket a day asking them when they're coming
out with a firmware that support WAAS on the BU353 because as far as
I'm concerned, they're guilty of false advertising. They said that
WAAS was supported, but it don't work. I follow the procedure to turn
it on, and it don't work. Firmware isn't my problem - they sold a
product which didn't do what it claims to do.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
