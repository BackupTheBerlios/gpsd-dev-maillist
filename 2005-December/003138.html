<PRE>&gt;<i> Permissions seem to be a bit of a mess, and (in Fedora-4, anyway) the
</I>Fedora folks seem to want to have ntpd running as user/group ntp.  I
solved the problem by making the SHM segment more generally readable.

The permissions should not be a problem as long as ntpd is started before
gpsd, which it is on my machine.  The NTP segments are then created by
ntpd and attached in gpsd before it drops privileges, so the access only
by root and user ntp works fine.
However, I don't see an immediate problem with this change.

&gt;<i> The second fix is needed because this particular unit (and I suspect
</I>other inexpensive units) provides the same timestamp on a set of NMEA
sentences, and the repeated updates to the SHM segment confuses NTP.
(The first update with the new timestamp is useful, the later ones
aren't.)  This fix, plus a fudge, generates more useful results (i.e.
within 10ms or so--not great, but not horrible.)

It would probably be better to fix this in the NMEA decoder (in fact in
nmea_parse_input in drivers.c), where this problem lies, than in ntpshm.
Putting a static variable last_fixtime in ntpshm.c is not a good idea as
there can be multiple SHM segments that all receive updates from one or
more receivers (I have two receivers, and PPS signalling that users 2
segments per receiver).
The last_fixtime should be part of the sesssion and can be kept in
drivers.c, or another trick can be used there to call ntpshm_put only once
per cycle.

As I have stated before, NMEA is IMHO not suitable for good timekeeping.
The NMEA timestamps are fix timestamps, and are good for wallclock time,
not milli/microsecond
timestamping.
