Gary, I just don't see your logic here, so we'll have to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; 
on my being the &quot;appointee&quot;. I consider myself to be an interested 3rd party 
providing relevant data based on my experiences. :^)

Well, I've been using Motif for over 13 years (and continue to use it, along 
with other toolkits) and I still suggest that your Motif installation is 
broken; it's certainly unlike anything I've seen in my time, especially given 
that we're both using Slackware.

It may be a LessTif / OpenMotif difference, as I stated in my original email 
on this topic. Every version of Slackware I've ever used (since LessTif 
became available) installed LessTif as the default. OpenMotif (which is more 
complete and capable, since it's essentially the open version of the official 
Motif release) became available in May 2000 and has been provided on Disc #3 
of the full set of 4 Slackware installation CDs ever since then.

Ditto.

Bottom Line: As near as I can tell, we have 2 users (Dave Cottingham and Kevin 
Battersby -- check the Oct 2005 'gpsd-users' archives) for whom adding the 
innocuous &quot;Xm/Xm.h&quot; dependency fixes the problem. Gary reports that it breaks 
his system, but I maintain that Gary's Motif setup is broken already and 
should not be used as a data point in the patch/no-patch decision. So, FWIW, 
I still vote to add the patch.
