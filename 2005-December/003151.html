I wrote it, so here is my bit of advocation.

I have no idea why you don't need to include Xm/Xm.h, I guess it gets
pulled in by some other header file. This used to be the case on my box
as well, until I upgraded lesstif.

Fact is, Xm/Xm.h is as much part of lesstif/motif as is Xm/XmStrDefs.h.
If you have the one, you have the other. Including Xm/Xm.h won't break
anything that doesn't break with a missing Xm/XmStrDefs.h anyway. For
what it's worth, xgps.c depends on Xm/Xm.h already.

Cheers, Til
