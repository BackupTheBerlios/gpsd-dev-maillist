Agreed.

</I>
Actually, that's not precisely true, it just seems that way. The Motif 
(keyboard-based) widget traversal mechanisms are working; it's just that 
(except for the 'Quit' pushbutton itself) all the 'XmNhighlightThickness' 
properties have been (somewhat foolishly, probably by someone who didn't 
appreciate Motif's keyboard widget traversal method) set to zero, so you 
cannot see which widget has the input focus!

If you hit the 'Tab' key several times, the 'Quit' pushbutton will eventually 
gain input focus and you can activate it with the keyboard (spacebar).

In reality, all of those Motif 'text' widgets should be 'label' widgets, so 
that they don't gain focus and don't need to be 'tabbed through' in the first 
place.

The issues/problems are even deeper, but I don't want to drag this out any 
further right now.... :^)

&gt;<i> It should at least exit when a 'q' is typed in the window.
</I>
That's debatable, but I don't really want to get into that. ;^)

This whole issue would be almost moot except for one thing. For some 
unfathomable reason, the 'XmNmwmFunctions' have been set such that the 'xgps' 
application cannot use the normal window-manager-based functionality (both 
keyboard-based and mouse-based) to kill it!

In fact, there's really no need to set _any_ of the resources on the Motif 
'Top Level' widget. If you comment out the line that does that:

   XtSetValues(toplevel, args, 6);

then the 'xgps' app still works just fine _and_ you can use the normal window 
manager methods to kill it. In fact, maybe one of you guys with SVN write 
access could kindly fix it just that way? Of course, if you do, you should 
also remove the 6 calls to 'XtSetArg()' just above it.

&gt;<i> Also, it segfaults when I display the status of my Trimble receiver before
</I>&gt;<i> it has acquired the satellites.
</I>
This is interesting. Can you be more specific, please? Does &quot;display the 
status&quot; mean &quot;run xgps&quot;? Where exactly does it segfault?
