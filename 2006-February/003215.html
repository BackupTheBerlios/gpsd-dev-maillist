The only reason I didn't patch it was that I figured it was such a simple fix 
that it would be easier for one of the devs to do it. However, I've since 
checked out all the latest 'gpsd' SVN sources (for the memory-leak patch I've 
just sent to the list), so I'll provide a patch for this window-manager thing 
when I get a chance.

Glad I'm not the only one who thought that source code formatting was a little 
off. :^)

&gt;<i> Also, there are two gotos whose right to exist I can't see.
</I>
I'll take care of that too.

&gt;<i> The real fix would be a re-write in KDE/qt or Gnome. 
</I>
I tend to agree. Maybe it would be better to just do that than to keep 
patching all the little flaws in the Motif version? Actually, there's nothing 
wrong with Motif, it's just that the 'xgps' app doesn't really use the Motif 
toolkit properly in all cases.

&gt;<i> Losing the Motif libs
</I>&gt;<i> would be a big win. The only reason I have them installed is xgps.
</I>
Aside: Slackware comes with LessTif (which I always promptly replace with 
OpenMotif, which is also supplied on the Slackware CDs). I wonder -- do most 
GNU/Linux distributions come with LessTif (and/or OpenMotif) these days?

Regards,
Bill Marr
