<PRE>Marr &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">marr at flex.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Either my ISP is slow delivering the mail or this part of the discussion was 
</I>&gt;<i> off-list. If the latter, please (Geoff) keep this on-list.
</I>
That's why I copied you.
 
&gt;<i> I believe this, but it doesn't jibe with what you said above. If you
</I>&gt;<i> truly had tested using my suggested fix (eliminate the setting of
</I>&gt;<i> _all_ the 'Top Level' widget resources)...
</I>
I'm not quite able to account for this either.  Most likely I just screwed
up and skipped a make step, so I wasn't testing what I thought I was.

&gt;<i> &gt; Modern UI practice has moved towards relying on the action triggered by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window manager kill button to cleanly terminate an application.  I'm quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tempted to remove the quit button entirely.  Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tend to agree here. Personally, I could easily do without a
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated in-app 'Quit' pushbutton (and any in-app menu 'File',
</I>&gt;<i> 'Quit' nonsense for cases where that applies). Having said that, it
</I>&gt;<i> probably breaks some UI &quot;style guide&quot; and might lead to confusion,
</I>&gt;<i> so be prepared for some &quot;pushback&quot;.
</I>
I'm not worried.  This isn't a GNOME or KDE app, so neither style
guide applies.  The precedents I was thinking of were administrative
apps from Red Hat's Bluecurve set, which tend to be minimalist in
style and rely on the WM kill button.

&gt;<i> Also,I was planning on moving the dedicated 'Quit' pushbutton up and
</I>&gt;<i> over, under the graphical part of the 'xgps' display, as you (Eric)
</I>&gt;<i> suggested earlier.
</I>
Already done in Geoff's patch.  He did a nice job of tightening up the
panel so it's smaller than before in spite of the new 14-row satellite
presentation.

&gt;<i> Ultimately though, I'd still vote to eliminate it. How's that for a 
</I>&gt;<i> long-winded way to agree with what Geoff said in just 3 words? :^)
</I>
I think I'll condition out the Quit button and see how it looks.
