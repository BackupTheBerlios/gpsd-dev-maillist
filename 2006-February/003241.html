I appreciate that. It's just that it seems that there was more off-list 
discussion than what was included in your copy. Not a big deal either way....

True, but I was actually thinking of generic UI design guidelines. I once had 
a manual (about 14 years ago, can't recall the source, something &quot;official&quot;) 
that was about 200-300+ pages and got into all aspects of UI design and 
studies. Quite boring, but platform-agnostic.

Plus, there's also an official Motif &quot;Style Guide&quot; book. I think I've still 
got a printed version somewhere. Ultimately, though, I don't feel bound by 
the Motif &quot;Style _Guide_&quot;, hence my vote to eliminate the 'Quit' pushbutton.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also,I was planning on moving the dedicated 'Quit' pushbutton up and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over, under the graphical part of the 'xgps' display, as you (Eric)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggested earlier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Already done in Geoff's patch.  He did a nice job of tightening up the

</I>&gt;<i> presentation.

OK, good. However, we should be clear on the goal. Making a good, well-behaved 
Motif app is often at odds with minimizing screen real-estate.

For example, certain widgets (like the satellite info table) might best be 
made to scroll vertically, to allow for even more than 14 satellites. Of 
course, that scrollbar takes real-estate. I know some toolkits can 
conditionally display the scrollbar as needed, but I don't recall if that 
applies to Motif and besides, you need to account for the worst-case size 
anyway.

Another example: Motif 'Frame' widgets around groupings of similar widgets are 
useful for (A) efficient use of the Motif keyboard 'widget traversal' 
mechanism I discussed earlier and (B) making the layout more appealing and 
logical -- but of course, frames take up a little bit of real-estate.

Personally, I think that as long as the default app size is under 800x600 
(which it already is), we shouldn't obsess over real-estate issues too much.

Aside: It's those KDE guys I need to talk to -- they have configuration 
dialogs that are virtually unusable on an 800x600 display! :^)
