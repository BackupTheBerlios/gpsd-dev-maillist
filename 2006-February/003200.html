</I>&gt;<i> Basically, there are conflicting definitions of the maximum number of
</I>&gt;<i> supported GPS channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 'gps.h' file defines:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    #define MAXCHANNELS  14      /* maximum GPS channels (*not* satellites!) */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> while 'xgps.c' defines:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    #define MAX_CHANNELS 12      /* count of channels to display */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While there could be a logical reason for separate definitions, I don't see it
</I>&gt;<i> here. In fact, the 'xgps.c' code only allocates vertical visual space for 12
</I>&gt;<i> positions for the list of satellites in the Motif 'list' widget...:
</I>
It is currently impossible to see more than 12 satellites above a 5
degree horizon. I don't think there's even anywhere on earth you could
see more than 12 satellites with a 0 degree horizon. The best I got
was 11, in Campbell River last summer. #12 was about 15 degrees up and
hidden behind a mountain.

As for the excessive number of channels, some receivers (like the
SiRFstarIII) don't use dedicated correlator hardware any more.
Instead, they have a fast DSP and a couple of big buffer into which
they sample the RF and then run a software correlation on it. The
correlator is fast enough to operate at &gt;20x realtime. That is to say:
the first buffer can be searched for 20 or more PRNs before the second
buffer fills up. I believe the buffer processing happens about 1000
times a second... sorry, don't remember where I saw that.

So 14 channels may be try to display because there are up to 12
visible regular birds, and 2 SBAS birds.

&gt;<i> While this is not a &quot;crash-the-app&quot; bug (due to the fact that the '14' version
</I>&gt;<i> of the constant is used in the string allocation code), it's clearly a
</I>&gt;<i> (probably accidental) mismatch and should be corrected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I don't know of a GPS receiver with more than 12 channels, but I
</I>&gt;<i> could be missing something. (I can [not-so-fondly] remember the days of
</I>&gt;<i> 1-channel GPS receivers!)
</I>
SiRFstarIII, plus a few others I haven't had a chance to play with.

&gt;<i> I'd suggest that we eliminate this discrepancy somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestion: If there's no good reason for 14 as the maximum, we should just
</I>&gt;<i> change 14 to 12 and eliminate the redundant 'MAX_CHANNELS' definition
</I>&gt;<i> entirely. On the other hand, if there's a good reason for 14 as the maximum,
</I>&gt;<i> 'xgps.h' should eliminate the 'MAX_CHANNELS' version and adjust its code
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly, thereby allowing display of up to 14 satellites in the Motif
</I>&gt;<i> 'list' widget.
</I>
I'll chew on that... I haven't done much with xgps, so if someone gets
the right patch before I get there... great.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
