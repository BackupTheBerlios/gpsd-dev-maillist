<PRE>GPSD Devs,

I submitted this patch on Jan 24th to fix a problem reported on the 'users' 
list. Since then, it seems like it hasn't been applied in the source code.

Therefore, I'm resubmitting this (slightly edited to remove tangential issues 
already addressed) to the 'dev' list (which, in retrospect, I probably should 
have CC'd in the first place), in the hopes that someone with check-in 
privileges will see this and apply the patch.

Thanks!

By the way, does anybody know when the next release of 'gpsd' will be out?

Greetings all,

I had noticed odd behavior a while ago too but ignored it. Since seeing these 
messages (and after recalling that 'xgpsspeed' had worked fine for me long 
ago [gpsd-1.x-era]), I took a quick look into this and (apparently) solved 
the problem described by the Debian bug report. 

The fix merely involved the addition of a couple boundary checks. Without 
these, the 'update_display()' routine in 'xgpsspeed.c' spins in what 
essentially turns out to be a never-ending loop as a result of the fact that 
'gpsd' seems to be reporting 'NaN' for 'fix.speed' for the first few passes 
when 'xgpsspeed' is run (at least on my system). This results in a ridiculous 
value (-2147483648) after the conversion to (e.g.) MPH, which sends the 
tachometer update routine into &quot;crazy-land&quot;. Essentially, the 
tachometer-widget's needle is spinning all over the place, which looks 
predictably odd.

While perusing the 'xgpsspeed' code and doing patch testing, I noticed that 
there are a couple of other bugs in 'xgpsspeed' as well, which I've also 
fixed.

------------------------------

Attached is a patch against 'xgpsspeed.c' in the 2.30 release of 'gpsd'. It 
fixes the following bugs in the 'xgpsspeed' application:

(1) Missing limit-checks on the tachometer widget can result in the tachometer 
needle spinning madly if invalid vehicle speeds are reported by 'gpsd'.

(2) The display of speed units (e.g. &quot;Miles per Hour&quot;) above the &quot;speedometer&quot; 
was erroneously always displaying &quot;Km per Hour&quot;, regardless of the speed 
units in use. Furthermore, although there was already a provision to select 
&quot;knots&quot; as the speed units (&quot;-speedunits knots&quot;), there was never any code to 
display the proper text!

(3) An erroneous conversion factor (the reciprocal of the correct value) was 
used to convert the native 'meters per second' GPS-reported speed into knots. 
This results in an erroneous needle position when &quot;-speedunits knots&quot; has 
been specified on the command line.

------------------------------

Although 'xgpsspeed' is a rather silly application (especially since it's 
limited to 0-100, given that it uses a 'tachometer percentage' widget to 
mimic a speedometer), if we're going to distribute it with 'gpsd', it might 
as well work as correctly as possible.

Therefore, I'd appreciate it if someone (Gary?) with check-in privileges could 
apply this patch for the next revision of 'gpsd'.

Thanks!
