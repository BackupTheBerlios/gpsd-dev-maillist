</I>
This point is not lost on me. I was thinking the much the same
thing... If your velocity component vectors are all zero, you can't
possibly have a heading because you're not going anywhere.

Also, if altitude is negative, that's a good sign that perhaps my
solution is invalid. In reality you probably wouldn't be taking any
action on a fix that said your position and velocities were
[[0,0,0],[0,0,0]] because your receiver would have not indicated that
was a valid solution.

As for rewriting it in C, I think libm is in C already, but the
different behaviour is due to differences of interpretation of the
math(3) rules. I think my libm is just being helpful by normalizing
all zeros.

I realize that I'm lucky if I get a result from 0/0, but depending on
which 30-second interval of calculus 101 one wakes up for, 0/0 = 1 or
0/0 does not exist or maybe some other interpretations. ;) As I've
personally run into at least two different sign-of-zero conventions
tonight - a fact that is screwing up our regression tests - I decided
to enforce one convention. Normalized zero.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
