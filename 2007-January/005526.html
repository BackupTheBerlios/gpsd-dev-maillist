   In that case, it might not be the answer to my requirement for
precise positioning calculation.  Which is not to say it might not be
useful---as I said, I will have a read and let you know what I think, FWIW.

   Yep, sorry I did not state that explicitly.  That is what my rinex.h
patch attempts to provide, a common data structure where you can store
normalised observation and ephemeris data for latter transmission to the
user (which does not have to be in RINEX format).  I merely copied the
RINEX schema because I thought it best not to try and reinvent the wheel
as to what is needed and how to represent it.

   Having said that, I do want gpsd to speak RINEX :)

   With regards to the discussion as to whether it should come from gpsd
itself or some external client, let me see if I get this right.  What
you propose would look something like:

gpsd --- (GPSD format) ---&gt; client [ PVT data ]
gpsd --- (NMEA format) ---&gt; client [ PVT data ]
gpsd --- (RTCM format) ---&gt; client [ DGPS data ]
gpsd --- (format 'X') ---&gt; gpsd2rinex --- (RINEX) ---&gt; client [ RINEX data ]

   as opposed to:

gpsd --- (GPSD format) ---&gt; client [ PVT data ]
gpsd --- (NMEA format) ---&gt; client [ PVT data ]
gpsd --- (RTCM format) ---&gt; client [ DGPS data ]
gpsd --- (RINEX format) ---&gt; client [ pseudoranges / nav. data ]

   or perhaps I have made totally the wrong assumptions as to the idea
you mentioned?  Was it perhaps some sort of &quot;plug-in&quot; approach you were
describing?

Regards,
Diego Berge.
