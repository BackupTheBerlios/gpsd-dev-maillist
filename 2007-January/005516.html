&gt;<i> The benefit was daemon simplicity. Not having to extend the daemon

</I>
   There would be two ways to go about it, one is to choose the widest
encompassing format (i.e., that which provides the most information),
the other.... the other I forgot but I'll come back to this paragraph
when I remember... need more coffee :-P

&gt;<i> Missile Applications Condensed Measurements. It is an efficient,
</I>&gt;<i> high-speed wire protocol for your  gps to talk to your  navigation
</I>&gt;<i> computer to integrate your measurements from your  inertial
</I>&gt;<i> measurement unit so that you get high-rate fixes...
</I>
   Ahh, INSes is another thing we need to keep in the back of our minds
when working on gpsd.  Sooner or latter someone is going to want to
attach an INS to it (any guesses as to who has access to inertial
navigation equipment and is starting to dribble? ;) )

   I will have a look at MACM when I can get online properly and let you
know what I think.  One thing in the meanwhile:  does it support
communication of ephemeris data?

&gt;<i> No, we haven't really picked a favorite. It seems you and I are the
</I>&gt;<i> only two who care about precise positioning and/or software solvers to
</I>&gt;<i> mention the issue on a regular basis... &quot;you snooze, you lose.&quot;
</I>
   Well, if you can deal with precise positioning, you can deal with
coarse positioning, so it makes sense to focus on the former.

&gt;<i> Basically, we were going for speed and integrity.
</I>
   There is an old joke about this:

&quot;Quick Jos&#233;, what is 5 + 3?&quot;

&quot;Nine!!!&quot; he shouts.

&quot;No Jos&#233;.... Five and three is eight&quot;

&quot;Ah my friend, you wanted speed or you wanted accuracy?&quot;

&gt;<i> Whatever process is used to extract raw measurements from the vendor
</I>&gt;<i> protocol must be fast and lightweight. Or maybe it can be a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> work, but optional at compile-time. If it's modular, that becomes
</I>&gt;<i> irrelevant.
</I>
   Well, it might be irrelevant from the point of view of gpsd, but the
other tool will still have to deal with it, so the net result is the
same, except now you have to extract data twice, once from the receiver
and once from gpsd.

&gt;<i> Second, we want to have maximum integrity. We should not do any
</I>&gt;<i> floating point math, or any significant conversion (like printf).
</I>
   In that case, that leaves you with only one option, which is to
output the raw GPS stream (possibly minus parity bits).  Problem is, not
all receivers give you access to raw GPS, so you will have to take
whichever numbers your GPS does give you and rearrange them back into
raw data, which entails exactly the same amount of floating point and
possibly conversion as going the opposite way.

   So to summarise, we are discussing two or three things here, namely:

 * What we offer to the client (pseudoranges, code &amp; phase measurements,
doppler shifts, clock offsets, ephemeris).

 * How we offer it.  RINEX is by far the dominant player in this area,
but of course there might be other options instead of or in addition to it.

 * How we produce what we offer (be it RINEX and/or something else).  We
have identified three options here:

   + Integrated in the server.  Same as PVTs, NMEA.

   + As a compile-time option.  Same as RTCM.

   + As an external client.  Same as the Google Maps PHP script.

   Perhaps it might be best if we deal with each of these points one at
a time?

   I suggest we start at the top and decide what data is it specifically
that we want to make available.

   I propose that 1) there needs to be a stated use case for it (e.g.,
&quot;obtain position information&quot;), 2) it needs to be something specific
(i.e., &quot;everything&quot; doesn't count), and 3) it needs to be available
today from at least one supported receiver (i.e., &quot;L5 phase&quot; doesn't count).

   So I'll go ahead and make my proposal for our present purposes:

 1) I want to be able to calculate precise absolute positions and/or
precise relative positions respect to other receivers, using data
obtained from a GPS unit via gpsd.  To this end:

 2) I need timestamped code and phase[*] measurements in the L1 and
L2[*] frequencies, along with satellite and receiver[*] clock offsets,
as well as UTC and ionospheric parameters[*] and ephemeris data[*] for
all satellites tracked.

 3) All of the above is available from at least one existing driver
(yep, navcom).  Those items not marked with [*] and possibly others, are
available from other drivers as well.  Items marked with [*] may or may
not be available on a particular epoch even for a receiver capable of
providing them and are optional.

   Please expand, reduce, or approve the list of data items above,
keeping in mind the specific use case mentioned.

Regards,
Diego Berge.
