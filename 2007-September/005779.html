<PRE>Hi guys there, at gpsd-dev, my name is Cris, and I recently downloaded and
compiled the &quot;gpsd&quot; to use it with various gps client softwares, thank you
very much for your very useful and nice work! :)

Now, I recently become to have interests to a project that consist on a
electronic board that is, in all and for all, a complete Linux system in
something about 10x10cm, with the Linux kernel running on it as operative
system, and many applications, linux applications ported on that specific
platform; the board provides 8MByte of flash memory and 32MByte of ram,
two usb ports, one ethernet port and much more..!! Details are here:
www.acmesystems.it;

there is of course support (provided by the linux kernel) for wifi,
bluetooth  (via usb) external memory card (mmc,sd) and a lot of other
things;

after this introduction I can explain what i'd like to do, port gpsd on
this platform (Axis Etrax 100LX), but I am not a programmer, I've a bit of
experience with Pascal, Basic, Perl and Php, but C/C++ are a &quot;black hole&quot;
for me.. ;) really, I'd like a lot do this to be able to run gpsd on this
device and use an external gps receiver linked via bluetooth; the gpsd
daemon can be so accessed by a netkork connection, wireless or wired!

To be onest I already tried to compile gpsd from source using the tools
provided by Axis, a gcc-cris compiler and a complete SDK, but I am not
able to compile it succesfully, it begins correctly, but after a while the
compilation gives error... Too complex for me, can you in some way help me
and give me some indications about how to do it? Sorry if I am OT, I'm not
a developer and I talk about things that are *not* directly related with
gpsd developing, but maybe the cross compilation of the software is not so
OT.. I hope.. ;)

Thank you a lot guys, and if you have a bit of free time, go give a look
on www.acmesystems.it, it's really a nice toy and at the same time it's
anything but a toy, you can use it to realize very very interestiong
projects;

Thank you again and guys,

bye

Cris :)

p.s. (sorry for my bad english)
