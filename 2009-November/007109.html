You lost me here.  What noise are we passing through?  I don't want to
go overboard, but if there are obvious further checks let's consider them.

Yeah, was looking at that.  Why make its job harder?

But how does chrony even see a PPS pulse.  Their readme says they have no
refclock drivers.

&gt;<i> &gt; Hard for me to believe that anyone interested in good time keeping could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; abide by that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes slewing (even that fast) is considered as a better alternative
</I>&gt;<i> to stepping time.
</I>
In which case gpsd should just get out of the way for a while.

&gt;<i> &gt; Would you consider wider checks for the first hour gpsd runs, or some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sort of adaptive window?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about wrapping the constants in a macro which could be adjusted in
</I>&gt;<i> configure?
</I>
No need to work on the config until we have a manual solution.

You do realize that the only ntpshm check against the sysclock is
only that the last serial time fix is less than one second old?  Only
if the clock slewed more than one second in one second will we reject
a PPS pulse.  If the clock is that bad we need to reject it.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Precision is calculated from offset. As H&#229;kan pointed out earlier,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; current offset (which is again based on local time) doesn't indicate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; how good is the PPS signal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can not agree with that, sure the number is a mish-mash, but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has real value as a 'goodness' indicator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jitter is a much better indicator, it's calculated in ntpd and visible
</I>&gt;<i> in ntpq output if you want to do a quick check. Also, if there is a
</I>&gt;<i> time1 specified in ntp.conf to compensate for an error, the offset
</I>&gt;<i> visible in gpsd will be different from the offset ntpd is trying to
</I>&gt;<i> correct.
</I>
Not sure what you are arguing for here.  I made your precision change as
requested.  After further tests and ntpd code review I can see it is a
no-op.

So, once again, the ntpshm provided precision GOES NOWHERE.

&gt;<i> BTW, raw PPS signal I'm getting here from GPS 18x LVC has about 2us
</I>&gt;<i> jitter.
</I>
I really doubt that.  I believe your measurement, or the ntpd value, has
that much jitter.

&gt;<i> &gt; I have been looking at the ntpd code and it does not appear to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the precision we provide for that purpose.  In fact it seems to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pretty much ignore the provided precision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, I thought that it was included in peer dispersion, but it really
</I>&gt;<i> looks like it's used only for reporting. Chrony ignores the precision
</I>&gt;<i> too, so I guess anything will work fine.
</I>
See, we agree.
