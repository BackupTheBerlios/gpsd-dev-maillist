&gt;<i> Yes, the usecs value should be always 0 unless the PPS signal has
</I>&gt;<i> frequency higher than 1 Hz. It's computed from
</I>&gt;<i> shmTime-&gt;clockTimeStampUSec which should be the time decoded from the
</I>&gt;<i> last received message. Most GPSs don't seem to even report anything
</I>&gt;<i> below seconds, so I'm wondering where does it come from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What values do you see there? What kind of GPS unit is it?
</I>
It's a motorola oncore.  I saw something like 176 ms.  Aha, it is mostly 
the offset of 0.16 s in driver_oncore.c at the call to ntpshm_put(), which 
is needed to get that one almost correct (give or take some ms).  Note 
that several other devices (almost all) also has these kinds of offsets, 
so the assumption that shmTime-&gt;clockTimeStampUSec is 0 does not work.

&gt;&gt;<i> On a side note:  I think the calculation of the precision, using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variable offset has issues.  As one in ntpd can fudge an additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offset of the reported times, when the system clock is driven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> towards that, we will never approach a zero difference, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therefore always report a 'bad' precision.  I think a precision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> estimate need to be based on the jitter (which would require some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> history...), and not on any absolute offset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think measuring jitter in gpsd would require that no other
</I>&gt;<i> application is controling the local clock. Using a fixed value like
</I>&gt;<i> -20 should be good enough.
</I>
True, when running with ntpshm some other program would presumably be 
controlling the clock.  But only slowly enough that e.g. measuring the 
jitter during the last 10-20 s should be fine.  One may even factor a 
linear relationship out.  I'll wrap something up.  (I already almost have 
it as I'm running a filter in ntpshm_pps.  The filter itself is perhaps 
not needed any longer as new ntpd does filtering.  In principle, the 
precision calculation should/could be done by ntpd itself too.)
