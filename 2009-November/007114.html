Not sure why you think it is aggressive with the source s/b so accurate.

&gt;<i> There was no release since the refclock support was added, use the
</I>&gt;<i> git repository instead.
</I>
Not gonna go there, got enough else on my plate to paly with beta's.

&gt;<i> Depends on how long does the slewing take. If it is long enough, the

</I>
Cleary we are not gonna agree, how about you check out the git chrony,
run some tests, and show me some real data.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; How about wrapping the constants in a macro which could be adjusted in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; configure?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No need to work on the config until we have a manual solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Automatic adjustment will make the code unnecessarily complicated, or
</I>&gt;<i> not? I'll be happy with a configure option.
</I>
We agree, can do the Auto if you can't do it manually.  So run some tests,
figure out what needs to be adjusted, then can move forward on this.  I
still do not see a problem that needs fixing.

&gt;<i> &gt; You do realize that the only ntpshm check against the sysclock is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only that the last serial time fix is less than one second old?  Only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if the clock slewed more than one second in one second will we reject
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a PPS pulse.  If the clock is that bad we need to reject it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but if the clock is running 10% faster because chrony is fast
</I>&gt;<i> slewing, the measured interval between pulses will be 10% longer.
</I>
Yah, I missed that, but if the clock is slewing that fast then the NMEA
time stamp is more than accurate enough for the short term.  So i do not
see a problem that needs fixing.  Feel free to run some tests and send
me the results if you have a patch that you can see (not just think)
makes a difference.

&gt;<i> &gt; I really doubt that.  I believe your measurement, or the ntpd value, has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that much jitter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Check the gpsd log I sent here week ago if you don't believe. Or ntp
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list archives, 1us jitter is not uncommon.
</I>
&gt;<i>  GPS models have PPS
</I>&gt;<i> signal rated usually at &lt;1us accuracy, sometimes even as low as 50 ns.
</I>
Apples and Oranges.  We agree the input is very good, and we agree that
after the UART and kernel errors it is less good.  Not sure if there
is a patch or other action item in there though....
