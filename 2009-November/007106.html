In the current code half of the noise will pass through anyway as the
cycle and duration are checked only from one side.

Latest ntpd versions use the median filter even for SHM samples, it
should be very effective in filtering out noise.

&gt;<i> Can you provide some links for me to look at about chrony and this 10%?

Look for slew_delta_tick and max_tick_bias in
<A HREF="http://git.tuxfamily.org/chrony/chrony.git/?p=gitroot/chrony/chrony.git;a=blob_plain;f=sys_linux.c;hb=HEAD">http://git.tuxfamily.org/chrony/chrony.git/?p=gitroot/chrony/chrony.git;a=blob_plain;f=sys_linux.c;hb=HEAD</A>

&gt;<i> Hard for me to believe that anyone interested in good time keeping could

</I>
Sometimes slewing (even that fast) is considered as a better alternative
to stepping time.

&gt;<i> Would you consider wider checks for the first hour gpsd runs, or some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of adaptive window?
</I>
How about wrapping the constants in a macro which could be adjusted in
configure?

&gt;<i> &gt; Precision is calculated from offset. As H&#229;kan pointed out earlier,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current offset (which is again based on local time) doesn't indicate

</I>&gt;<i> I can not agree with that, sure the number is a mish-mash, but it

</I>
Jitter is a much better indicator, it's calculated in ntpd and visible
in ntpq output if you want to do a quick check. Also, if there is a
time1 specified in ntp.conf to compensate for an error, the offset
visible in gpsd will be different from the offset ntpd is trying to
correct.

BTW, raw PPS signal I'm getting here from GPS 18x LVC has about 2us
jitter.

&gt;<i> &gt; Before the local clock is synchronized,

</I>
Hm, I thought that it was included in peer dispersion, but it really
looks like it's used only for reporting. Chrony ignores the precision
too, so I guess anything will work fine.

Thanks,
