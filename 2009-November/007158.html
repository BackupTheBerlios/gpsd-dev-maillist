<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; I've heard rumor that the early, alpha versions of scons were flaky.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps you were using one of those?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe so - this was 2+ years ago on lprof.
</I>
Yeah, that'd make a *big* difference. I took a first look at scons
around the same time you were using (maybe a few nmonths earlier) it
and rejected it as promising but immature.

We did the Wesnoth conversion about nine months ago, at which point
scons had improved really dramatically, to the point where it was a
clear win over autotools.

I've occasionally checked on scons development since and it appears
they haven't slowed down.  Notably, a module to support generating
autotools-like config files for backwards compatibility, experimental
when I used it for Wesnoth, now seems to be part of base scons.
 
&gt;<i> IMHO the build system also needs to support cross builds and builds in
</I>&gt;<i> objdirs with r/o source trees.  I would think scons does that by now,
</I>&gt;<i> but in any case that's probably a discussion for later.
</I>
I think it does, but you're quite right.  Moving to scons, if we do
it at all, is not a near-term project.
