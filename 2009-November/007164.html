<PRE>
The attached patch examines the possibility of polling for PPS signals 
instead of waiting for their interrupts.  The purpose is to get rid of the 
(unknown) latency from the actual PPS signal on the serial pin until we 
reach user-space and the gettimeofday() call after ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) 
inside gpsd_ppsmonitor().  I've measured the latency with a scope on a 2.4 
GHz Athlon64 to be ~20 us (by toggling an output pin before doing the 
gettimeofday(); the toggling as such was ~1 us).  Measured in other ways, 
the latency on a 2.0 GHz Athlon looked like 25 us, and on a 800 MHz VIA 
Nehemiah it is 38 us.

The active part of the code is a tight poll loop calling gettimeofday() 
and ioctl(TIOCMGET) waiting for the state change.  By using the previous 
detected state changes (initally from the TIOCMIWAIT processing), the time 
of the next occurrence is estimated, and a usleep() is issued to not waste 
CPU and let gpsd_ppsmonitor wake up just in time to start polling before 
the interesting pulse is expected.

The oversleep by usleep() is taken into account, to (most often) not miss 
the change.  With the new higher resultion timing on Linux (since 
somewhere between 2.6.18 and 2.6.26) this is quite exact, down to about 5 
us jitter and a 25 us constant (the VIA CPU).

To not be hit by the CPU dealing with the actual interrupt from the serial 
pin, the time of the PPS pulse is taken from the previous gettimeofday() 
call in the poll loop which was surrounded by no state change reported by 
ioctl(TIOCMGET), and extrapolated one poll cycle forward in time.  I.e. 
extrapolated to the time of the gettimeofday() call surrounded by the 
state change.  On the MHz 800 VIA CPU, the poll cycle is about 4 us.  On 
the 2.0 GHz Athlon, it looks like 1.5 us.

The time of a poll cycle is determined by measuring the time of 8 cycles 
(to avoid measuring just 1 or 2 us on faster CPUs), and the polling is 
started approximately 25-30 cycles before the estimated pulse.  Thus, the 
polling should cost about 100us/s = 0.01% CPU load.  If no pulse is seen 
within 1 ms, it gives up on that pulse.

The code is not yet tested on a module which gives just a 1 us pulses 
('invisible').  I've seen that those can be detected in this way in dry 
tests, but not with 100% efficiency.  In general, whenever pulses are 
missed by the polling, gpsd_ppsmonitor() goes back to do irq wait, and 
will eventually try to find the pulse again.  This likely need some better 
handling to deal with invisibles.

A related thing is what to do when gpsd_ppsmonitor() (temporarily) goes 
back to interrupt wait mode.  Then, the latency will be added to the 
measured values, leading to bad data in ntpshm_pps().  One solution is to 
also actually determine the latency.  This can be done, but will be sort 
of messy.  Another solution would be to not send irq waited 
data to ntpshm_pps(), and only use that for regaining lock, after pulses 
were lost.

Definately not suggested for commit, but am curious for comments, tests 
etc.

Cheers,
H&#229;kan
