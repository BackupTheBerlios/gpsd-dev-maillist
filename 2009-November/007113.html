My bad, indeed both sides are checked, they are now just seperated.

&gt;<i> &gt; Latest ntpd versions use the median filter even for SHM samples, it

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, was looking at that.  Why make its job harder?
</I>
Or why to try filter them so aggressively when they will be filtered
more effectively later?

&gt;<i> But how does chrony even see a PPS pulse.  Their readme says they have no
</I>&gt;<i> refclock drivers.
</I>
There was no release since the refclock support was added, use the
git repository instead.

&gt;<i> &gt; Sometimes slewing (even that fast) is considered as a better alternative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to stepping time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In which case gpsd should just get out of the way for a while.
</I>
Depends on how long does the slewing take. If it is long enough, the
PPS source will disappear and chrony will have to temporarily switch
to another (possibly much worse) source.

And if the PPS signal is the only source, chrony might not recover
correctly after slewing, stay outside the 0.1% range and drift away
until an admin notices this. 

Note that chrony serves the &quot;good&quot; time even if the slewing hasn't
finished yet. This is very important for some users.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Would you consider wider checks for the first hour gpsd runs, or some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sort of adaptive window?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How about wrapping the constants in a macro which could be adjusted in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configure?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No need to work on the config until we have a manual solution.
</I>
Automatic adjustment will make the code unnecessarily complicated, or
not? I'll be happy with a configure option.

&gt;<i> You do realize that the only ntpshm check against the sysclock is
</I>&gt;<i> only that the last serial time fix is less than one second old?  Only
</I>&gt;<i> if the clock slewed more than one second in one second will we reject
</I>&gt;<i> a PPS pulse.  If the clock is that bad we need to reject it.
</I>
Yes, but if the clock is running 10% faster because chrony is fast
slewing, the measured interval between pulses will be 10% longer.

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, raw PPS signal I'm getting here from GPS 18x LVC has about 2us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jitter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really doubt that.  I believe your measurement, or the ntpd value, has
</I>&gt;<i> that much jitter.
</I>
Check the gpsd log I sent here week ago if you don't believe. Or ntp
mailing list archives, 1us jitter is not uncommon. GPS models have PPS
signal rated usually at &lt;1us accuracy, sometimes even as low as 50 ns.
Most important is the jitter caused by serial driver, scheduling,
temperature stability, etc.
