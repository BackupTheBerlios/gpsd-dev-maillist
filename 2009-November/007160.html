<PRE>Michael R. Davis &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">mrdvt92 at yahoo.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> If you restart the deamon and then quickly execute a
</I>&gt;<i> ?WATCH={&quot;enable&quot;:true}; You get the DEVICES object before the DEVICE
</I>&gt;<i> has had a chance to get the flags or subtype properties.
</I>
Yes, this is an unavoidable hardware-level race condition.  The time
at which the device probe will elicit a device subtype ID - or even
whether it will do so at all - is not predictable.  The time at which
gpsd will achieve packet sync after the device is opened as an effect
of the ?WATCH is also not predictable.

You're now bumping into one of the major reasons I designed the new
protocol around streaming and the client library is designed to handle
any response at any time rather than being built around a lockstep
assumption and query operations.  

Older protocol versions tried to paper over this problem, pretending
the device can be assumed to be in a good state (with driver type
known) any time after channel attach.  It cannot be; the problem is
fundamental.  

In fact, it is not even guaranteed that any device in the DEVICES list
will *ever* achieve packet sync - you could be looking at non-GPSes or
GPSes of unknown type, put in GPSD's device pool by udev simply
because of a USB hotplug event.

Hm.  This may belong in the FAQ.

&gt;<i>I also think the WATCH object should come before the the DEVICES
</I>&gt;<i>object in the return.
</I>
If this proposal is an attempt to head off the race condition, it won't work.

The initial DEVICES response is intended to tell the client the driver
type in the event that gpsd has already achieved packet sync when the
device is opened.  Perhaps gpsd was started with -n, or another GPSD
client application has previously triggered the GPS open.

If this isn't the case, gpsd will ship a DEVICE notification when the
device subtype field is set.  Clients need to watch for both cases 
if they're interested in that information.
