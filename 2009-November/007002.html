If you are talking about the state before r5997, it didn't work well
for me (with GPS 18x LVC). I had to tweak the *MAX_OFFSET values. Then
there was the bug that both edges were reported so there was high
chance that ntpd was syncing to clear edge instead of assert.

With chrony it was unstable as it can slew the local clock very
aggressively which made gpsd stop reporting the pulses.

The patch actually added support for 5Hz PPS. In ntpd only 1Hz PPS is
supported, but it should work with chrony if anyone is interested in
testing it.

Please consider applying the patch again (plus the one-liner from my
previous post), it really makes things simpler and more robust. If
there are any issues with the Zodiac driver I'm sure we can work it
out.

Thanks,
