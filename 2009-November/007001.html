Hi again,

here is another go.  The one-line patch I came with before, please ignore 
that.  After manual-, code-, bugreport-, and old mail-reading:

The issue of determining which edge of the PPS pulse to use is handled in
libgpsd_core.c, well separated from the rest.  Helps.  Miroslav's patch in
that file, using the min_interval, max_interval, in_interval macros I
think did make it more readable.  It did however make the acceptance
ranges for intervals larger, and also made some stricter requirements on
the length of the pulses (or rather the time between the pulses).  It is
probably orthogonal enough that we can treat this as a separate issue from
ntpshm_{put,pps}?

According to manuals, the garmin 18, (16+17), oncore and sirf deliver the
serial time-stamp messages _after_ the PPS pulse.  I.e. the time given
refers to a pulse that has occurred.  The zodiac is opposite, giving the
time of the pulse which will come (message ~400 ms beforehand).  This
perhaps explains the &gt; 1 s magic offsets for the zodiac?

I'd propose to re-model the work-division between ntpshm_put and
ntpshm_pps according to this strict chronology of events.  ntpshm_put() is
called from the respective drivers and thus knows which model applies.
It can give this information as an additional argument, PPS_BEFORE_SERIAL,
or PPS_AFTER_SERIAL.  It also should carry either two times or one time
and an offset describing the other time.  One of the times would be the
correct time of the referenced PPS pulse.  The other would be the best
estimate of the correct time of the serial message.  These extra arguments
avoids guesswork by ntpshm_pps.

In any case, ntpshm_put does the update of shmTime just like it does now.

ntpshm_pps would for PPS_BEFORE_SERIAL cases only take the system clock
time stamp of the pps pulse, and store this for processing by the next
ntpshm_put call.  ntpshm_put verifies that not more than 1 period passed
since the last PPS pulse seen.  If ok, then update shmTimeP using the PPS
reference time and declare the pulse consumed.

For PPS_AFTER_SERIAL, ntpshm_pps does the update of shmTimeP, after
ensuring that we are not more than 1 period away from the time info was
delivered by ntpshm_put.

This should work also as is for the 5 Hz pulses from garmin.  According to
manual, they give serial time info 5 times per second, with 0.1 s
resolution.  (I presume 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8)

I am aware this is a substantial logics change.  Would it be interesting
to anyhow try, such that I come up with a patch?

Additional notes:

Even if one get the 5 Hz pulses to work in gpsd, ntpd will only use one
per second.  I suppose it in principle would be more important for
precision time-keeping to use e.g. the linuxpps time stamping facilities
and get some (e.g. 1 per second) accurate pps pulses rather than a lot
that needs heavy filtering (in ntpd or some other place) and suffer from
varying load-dependent latencies.

If we want the (coarse, shmTime) serial message time stamps to be better
(not very interesting to people with PPS, but perhaps to others), I guess
it may be of interest to start to time-stamp all serial message
receptions, such that corrections for various baud-rates can be applied.

Cheers,
H&#229;kan
