Eh, this is fine... so little traffic on either, and I read both...

</I>
ie. after 3 or 4 successful connects, gpsd tried to switch your
receiver to binary mode....

&gt;<i> Was this bug reported to the Holux support ?
</I>
Nope. It's not strictly a Holux problem either, though they use
components that seem to exhibit this problem. I think whoever makes
their bluetooth chip needs to be complained at. Then again, Holux
probably just OEMs the board from some other vendor (like
Globalsat)...

&gt;<i> According to Holux Germany they are not aware of this problem.
</I>&gt;<i> But I have a contact (mail and phone) for a person for the
</I>&gt;<i> support of Holux Germany. So I can - and will - report this
</I>&gt;<i> issue (again ?) to Holux. I hope they will fix this issue.
</I>
They may know of it, in the guise of &quot;Do not use SiRFdemo to change
the speed on the GPS&quot;. I've seen quite a number of forum posts where
people have rendered their receivers inoperable because they switched
the speed with SiRFdemo, so it's not just GPSD's fault. It's the usb
or bluetooth interface that can't cope.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
