<PRE>Hi!

At first I hope this is the correct mailinglist
(or should I post - and subscribe - to gpsd-users?).

So after 3 or 4 successfull connects to the Holux GR240
it is now &quot;dead&quot; like a GR236. As both devices use
the Sirf III chipset I guess they may use the same
hardware on both models. Unfortunately you can't remove
the battery on the GR240 because it is built in. :/

So here is the question ...

Was this bug reported to the Holux support ?

I had a choice between a GR236 and GR240. So I choosed
the GR240 and told them about the firmware bug.

According to Holux Germany they are not aware of this problem.
But I have a contact (mail and phone) for a person for the
support of Holux Germany. So I can - and will - report this
issue (again ?) to Holux. I hope they will fix this issue.


So long,

Andreas.

P.S.: Sorry for sending a incomplete message. I hit
the accidently hit send button.
