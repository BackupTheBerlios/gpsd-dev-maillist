</I>Hmmm ... ok.
But using xxd on the established connection I didn't see
a reply. Not even a binary one.

Interesting enough gpsd used 9600,8N1 but the documentation states it
will (have to?) operate with 38400,8N1.

I tried other programs like &quot;gps locator&quot; on WinDOS PocketPC 5.1.195
there was a bluetooth connection but no data. But I dont know if it
tries to speak NMEA only or if they fall back to the binary mode.

I will try the programs shipped with this device on *shudder* Windows XP.
Maybe it will try the binary mode. May be it wont.

Anyway it seems that this is a problem with Holux devices using the
Sirf chipset. The M1000 (using MTK MT3318 chipset) is not affected
by this bug.

&gt;<i> &gt; Was this bug reported to the Holux support ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope. It's not strictly a Holux problem either, though they use
</I>&gt;<i> components that seem to exhibit this problem. I think whoever makes
</I>&gt;<i> their bluetooth chip needs to be complained at. Then again, Holux
</I>&gt;<i> probably just OEMs the board from some other vendor (like
</I>&gt;<i> Globalsat)...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; According to Holux Germany they are not aware of this problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I have a contact (mail and phone) for a person for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support of Holux Germany. So I can - and will - report this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue (again ?) to Holux. I hope they will fix this issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They may know of it, in the guise of &quot;Do not use SiRFdemo to change
</I>&gt;<i> the speed on the GPS&quot;. I've seen quite a number of forum posts where
</I>&gt;<i> people have rendered their receivers inoperable because they switched
</I>&gt;<i> the speed with SiRFdemo, so it's not just GPSD's fault. It's the usb
</I>&gt;<i> or bluetooth interface that can't cope.
</I>O.K. and I don't blame gpsd for that ;)

I will report that problem to Holux. I hope they will fix it
or at least report that problem upstream to their OEM providers
and get it fixed sometimes.

So long,

Andreas.
