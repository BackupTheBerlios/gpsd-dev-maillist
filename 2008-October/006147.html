i'm not sure people know that their position is exposed.  while we
wait for eric's protov4 parser, i will add a note to the security
section that clearly states that your position is exposed. given the
number of RTFM and RTFfaq questions i've answered, i'm not sure anyone
would notice. :P

i live in a belt-n-suspenders world, so i packet filter my laptop
anyway. i freely stipulate that not all users go to such lengths.

i've not scanned the net for gpsd instances, gut feeling says:
- they're few and far between. we're not in calc.exe-land, any more toto. :)
- the majority keep moving around (physically and on the network)
- there is little identifying information available (there are a small
number of firmwares that seem to make up the vast majority of the
market, and except for expensive professional receivers, most don't
seem to have or expose a serial number)
... but my gut feelings have been wrong before

i'm ambivalent - i don't want to add more command line flags, but i
totally get the privacy argument. i also get the backward
compatibility argument. i don't think much would break if we switched
to localhost as the default listen address; it seems like most clients
assume that they should connect to localhost, and the user can
override that.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
