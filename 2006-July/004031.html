Amen.

&gt;<i> &gt; poll() provides a mechanism for multiplexing I/O across a set of file

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; select(2), however, it is possible to only pass in data corresponding

</I>
My select loop serviced several thousand clients. It was often the case that 
the highest fd was almost the last one left, and you got big gaps. Wasteful.
For a high number of connected clients poll(2) is a big win. The poll(2) 
semantics are also more digestible by humans (assuming I am human).
Select has so many pitfalls, it kills every new programmer. Once you are an 
old fart like me though, you have paid your dues and select(2) only 
occasionally bites you in the behind.

The linux select(2) man page claims select(2) is more portable. I doubt that 
that is still the case half a decade later. Poll also can be easily 
implemented using select(2), of course you lose every advantage.

I have done extensive performance analyses on select(2). For a low number of 
clients and limiting the loop to high_fd+1 there is no problem.

Keep in mind, if only one out of getdtablesize() fd's is set, it's like runing 
an empty for-loop. If that causes you grief, than fdtablesize should not be 
so high for that process.

If you have a lot of churn, and fd's are not reused, you can still get in 
trouble.

On Windows you are always in trouble.
 
Cheers,
Remco
