<PRE>Dear Sir/Madam 
I, am Mr Collins Nesik (Director of Finance ),Exchange Control South Africa Ministry of Finance . I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On june 6th 2006, an American oil consultant/contractor with South Africa Mining corporation, Mr. Patrick kelly James, made a fixed deposit for 24 calendar months,valued at $7,000,000.00(seven million Dollars) with Almagamated Bank in south Africa .After the fixed duration maturity, the bank Manager sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. 
After a month, the bank sent a reminder and finally we discover from his contract/employers: South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Patrick kelly james, died from an Automobile Accident. on further investigation, they found out that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. 
The matter was later reported to Ministry of Finance for proper investigation. I therefore made further investigetion and discovered that Mr. Patrick kelly james, did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork with Almagamated Bank on this sum $7,000,000.00, this sum is still sitting in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. up till this moment no one has ever come forward to claim this sum. 
Accccording to South African law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequntly, my proposal is that i will want you as a foriegner to stand in as the actual next of kin to Mr.Patrick kelly james , with this the fruits of Late, Patrick Kelly jame's labour will not get into the hands of South African Government. 
This is simple, i will like you to provide immediately, your full names and 
address so that an arranged Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and 
affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.,also will be drafting notarization of the (Will), and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer , we would need you as a foreigner to take up this responsibility and act as the actual next of kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mr. Patrick kelly James, to travel and claim this money in (ABN AMRO BANK) in Europe were i have concluded arrangements, as the Director of Finance Exchange Control, as an offshore clearing house for the security of this funds. 
The money will be shared in the ratio of 65% for top notchers in south africa While 35% for you. as our foreign partner, There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be handled well by an attorney and my position as the Director of Finance will facilitates the successful Execution of this transaction. if you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below.upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
