<PRE>I've had a lot of time to focus on gpsd recently, because the
consulting gig that ate most of my life for the last seven months has
hit a slack period.

I've been using this time to digest the implications of some features
contributed by people working with single-board computers who have
serious concerns about gpsd's processor and memory utilization.  All
the zero-configuration stuff I coded in is great for the PC
environment, but it comes at a resource cost that may not be
acceptable for very small and low-power SBC systems.

Thus, I've been encouraging the SBC crowd to hack gpsd so that 
expensive behavior can be configured out at compile time.  My vision
is that the default build remains all-singing, all-dancing, all 
self-configuring -- but for those willing to build from source, it's
possible to strip out functionality not needed in an SBC environment,

We have three capabilities to do this now:

1. It's possible to wire down gpsd's serial-port baud rate so it
doesn't have to hunt for one.

2. It's possible to limit the maximum number of concurrent sessions
(what's actually done is a bit trickier than this, but it's the
effect).  This can drastically cut gpsd's core footprint.

3. It's possible to limit the number of device channels supported.
This, too, can drastically cut gpsd's core footprint.

Stepping back and looking at where this is going, I've decided to
partly reverse a policy decision I made at the time I was originally
writing the GPS-type-recognition support.  In HACKING, it says:

    Here is a concrete example of how this principle applies.  At least
    one very low-end GPS chipset does not deliver correct checksums on the
    packets it ships to a host unless it has a fix.  Typically, GPSes do
    not have a fix when they are plugged in, at the time gpsd must
    recognize and autoconfigure the device.  Thus, supporting this chipset
    would require that we either (a) disable packet integrity checking in
    the autoconfiguration code, making detection of other more
    well-behaved devices unreliable, or (b) add an invocation switch to
    disable packet integrity checking for that chipset alone.  We refuse
    to do either, and do not support this chipset.

I'm still adamant that zero configuration is a more important feature
of the default build than support for every single broken device out
there.  There will be no, repeat *no*, GPS-type options for gpsd
at runtime.

However, I'm now willing to accept a patch that would disable
GPS-type autoconfiguration entirely at compile time, wiring the build
to recognize exclusively a single GPS type.  It seems to me this is
the only missing capability people doing SBC deployments need. 

A gpsd built that way could sync up with devices that emit too few
unique cues to be distinguished by the packet state machine in the
default build, or with devices like that crappy chipset that botches
checksums.

I'd actually write this patch myself, but I suspect it will come
faster and better from someone who actually needs it.  Consider this
an invitation...

Being as his father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the
fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.
