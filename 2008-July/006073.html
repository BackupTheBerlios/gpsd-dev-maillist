<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> One thing I'd like to use RTCM3 for is offline correction of my NMEA /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gpsd stream; when I go openstreetmapping or geocaching somewhere in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wilderness I'm unlikely to have Internet, so I'd have to postprocess
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What facility, if any, do you want in gpsd to support this?
</I>
In my mind, it makes sense to have a &quot;fake&quot; gps source (which I think
we have already), as well as a demo program that just streams all the
gps data to disk (I think we just have &quot;gps/xgps&quot; to monitor things,
maybe they stream to disk already).  Seems to me, a demo app that just
logs the rtcm as well would make sense (given the implementation of a
port for receiveing rtcm like the existing one for gps).  I suppose
one could argue the point of making a seperate rtcmd (dgpsd?) vs.
adding the functionality to gpsd itself (which is already done, of
course).  I'm all for keeping everything gps-related in one daemon,
don't get me wrong.  It just popped into my head.

On a completely different note, the last few emails led me to believe
that gpsd is not applying corrections on it's own, but just streaming
them back to any enabled gps.  I thought gpsd was supposed to do
corrections on it's own to it's output stream, for non-dgps-ready
devices, to add dgps to them.  Is that not the case?
