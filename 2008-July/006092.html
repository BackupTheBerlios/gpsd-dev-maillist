<PRE>I have the capability to test the rtcm3 decoder, but not the pass thru
(I have a source, but no target at the moment).

</I>&gt;<i> algorithm I've ever seen). The RTCM3.1 standard includes a hex dump of
</I>&gt;<i> a good test packet.  Thus, I have high confidence in the support at
</I>&gt;<i> the packet-sniffer level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am fairly sure that gpsd will correctly pass RTCM3 packets from a source

</I>&gt;<i> cut and pasted the RTCM2 passthrough support.  But this needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> tested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To test RTCM3 passthrough, somebody needs to run gpsd at a high debug level
</I>&gt;<i> with the right equipment attached (an RTCM3 source and an
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM3-capable GPS) and verify by looking at the &lt;= and =&gt;  that the
</I>&gt;<i> right thing is happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Testing rtcmdecode's facility to analyze and dump the contents of
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM3 packets is more difficult; in fact, right now I have no way to
</I>&gt;<i> check the correctness of that code, and it is almost certainly wrong
</I>&gt;<i> in some of its details. I've tried to follow the 10403.1 standard as
</I>&gt;<i> closely as possible, but getting this sort of thing perfect on the
</I>&gt;<i> first try is notoriously difficult and I doubt I have managed it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just having a binary RTCM3 capture isn't good enough.  To verify this
</I>&gt;<i> code I need both a capture and a set of testable assertions about what the
</I>&gt;<i> the data in it means -- ideally, an ASCII dump of the data fields in the
</I>&gt;<i> capture produced by a tool that is known good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't actually finished the analyzer code, because there doersn't
</I>&gt;<i> seem to be a lot of point in trying before I can test it.  Can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> supply both a binary RTCM3 test load and some sort of text dump of at
</I>&gt;<i> least the key data in it?
