<PRE>Right.

There is another outspoken person who said: For the fun of it

&gt;<i> That's how I got started with gpsd - I wrote a perl toolkit to do on
</I>&gt;<i> *NIX what SiRFdemo does on Windows. Spent quite a bit of time
</I>&gt;<i> validating it against the Windows tools. And then this guy calling
</I>&gt;<i> himself Eric mails me asking all these questions about SiRF
</I>&gt;<i> receivers... it was all downhill from there.
</I>
Like I said: I am, among other things, into embedded stuff.
In many cases that means rely on the vendors documentation and try to poke
at some critter on your desk until it shows signs of life and starts doing the things
you want it to do. Thats fun!
Going out and buy some Windows stuff to do the same isn't.
That's what I meant by better ways to do things and judging from the reactions we all
agree to that.

(That's not withstanding Chris having a point when he says that looking at a working
system may reveal flaws in the documentation.)

So I confess there is an Olimex LPC2148 board on my desk which talks to a Sirf-III,
and a FV-M11 for which I wrote the NMEA and other drivers from scratch.
As the EVK-5H is delivered with USB, I started looking for a fast way to hook it up,
hence gpsd.
And then I realized I had something this goup has on the whish list.

So gentlemen, if you will now excuse me, I'm out to study the code!
Bet it will be a lot of fun!

Henk
