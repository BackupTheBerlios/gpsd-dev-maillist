&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; One thing I'd like to use RTCM3 for is offline correction of my NMEA /

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Postprocessing requires a steam of timestamp+offset-for-lat/long/height

</I>&gt;<i> store the differences between their reported positions.
</I>
Perhaps you know this, but for everyone else: 

Normal GPS observes pseudranges (combination of distance and time
offset), and then does a least-squares fit to get position.  DGPS
corrections are basically a pseudorange error, a time, and a pseudorange
error rate.  One then applies the corrections to the pseudoranges before
solving.

It's natural to think about applying the corrections to the
already-computed position solution, but that's hard because you have to
back out the solution with the errors.  The hardest part is making sure
that you know which satellites were in the solutions, and then perhaps
you could.

The bottom line is that until gpsd grows support for taking raw
pseudoranges and computing position solutions, it doesn't make sense to
talk about it applying RTCM corrections to positions.

&gt;<i> (*) High-end commercial surveying systems which do this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> post-processing store the raw satellite reception parameters
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. signal offset and phase) instead of the waypoint coordinate, and
</I>&gt;<i> apply the RTCM corrections before they calculate their position, thereby
</I>&gt;<i> delivering another order of magnitude of accuracy. Unfortunately that's
</I>&gt;<i> all proprietary AFAIK; even if it wasn't, somebody would have to write
</I>&gt;<i> code for GPS analysis. Which is NOT easy.
</I>
I don't think it's all proprietary, and moderately-priced receivers do
this too.  But you do need code to solve the positioning equations, and
you'd need essentially the same code to extend to compute a position
error from a position solution and list of satellites.

&gt;<i> I'm somewhat annoyed about the fact that all this effort would be mostly
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary if the 2-GHz signal wasn't encrypted, but oh well ...
</I>&gt;<i> we work with what we have.
</I>
There is no 2 GHz signal; L1 is 1575 and L2 is 1200ish.  There is talk
of an L2 civil signal, and this would let people avoid most of the error
due to ionospheric delay.  But there's still unmodeled tropospheric
delay, clock errors, and orbit errors - differential takes out all of
them.

As for being annoyed, let me know when you or someone else launches a
24-bird constellation and give it away :) Last I heard Galileo was
planning to charge for access to accurate signals - I think the L1-only
GPS signal is pretty spiffy for being free.  But that's veering off topic.
