<PRE>  [what 3G vc system to use]

delurking briefly...

I have been the head CVS weenie at my group at BBN since 1995, and we only
this year started going anything else, valuing stability over new features,
and the new thing is svn.

Is it really disconnected operation that one gets, or the ability of
non-commiters to publish their branches.  I realize that it's sort of
the same thing, but I do work on projects with cvs and svn on the train
pretty frequently and don't have a problem.  The big issue is merging,
and I don't see that any of this avoids merge conflicts.

All that said, the ability of &quot;users&quot; to publish branches and let them
be merged to the trunk is nice.  I wonder what the experience has been
(in projects like gpsd) of those non-committing users actually getting
the tool set up enough to do this.

I have been a user and very very minor contributor to guile-gnome, and
they've changed version-control systems several times, perhaps only from
cvs to arch to bzr.  Every time I had trouble getting set up (and I'm
moderately clueful :-), mostly because things were underdocumented and
because they kept moving to bleeding edge, boutiquish,
flavor-of-the-month tools.

I have asked one of my staff to try out some of the 3g systems for us to
consider, and I read your descriptions with great interest.  He had used
hg for a project, to allow 2 or 3 people to manage (jointly) a branch
off the 'real' code before a critical demo.  It was ok when set up, but
awkward to set up and a bit counterintuitive.  (This person is both very
together and a programmer.)

Your bias towards bzr and hg (given a switch) sounds pretty sane to me.

NetBSD still uses CVS.  The main issues are lack of people writing the
right code, and I don't think that CVS has anything to do with this.

All in all, I'd say that if svn isn't causing real pain, leave well
enough alone.  The vc system is almost surely not the problem - it's
lack of *anyone* having the code we want.
