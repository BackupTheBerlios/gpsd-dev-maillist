<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been able to pin down a problem with the 1pps code, but I need a bit 
</I>of 
&gt;&gt;<i> help with it. I am not sure if it is caused by a bug, or by the way the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serial port works on a fundamental level. This is why I need some help to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clarify the situation. Unfortunately, this is a LONG mail because of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nature of the problem and the investigations I had to make.
</I>
&gt;<i>This post is nearly six months old. &#160;Have you, in thge time since, achieved 
</I>&gt;<i>better understanding?

Eric,

Since that time I have been successfully running a correction with no apparent 
ill effects. This has also been tested by David Cottle who has been 
co-operating in my work.

I have actually sent a couple of mails to you and Chris in the mean time, but 
I know that you both have been busy on other stuff.

In short, I propose shifting the 1pps startup to its own routine and making a 
couple of other changes so that we only trigger it after we have a solid idea 
about which device we are using and the baud rate is set.

I am now convinced that the underlying problem is caused by the way the serial 
port is handled by the kernel driver during port re-configuration. It appears 
to trash any previously set stuff like the 1pps interrupt thread.

I have a full patch ready, but I have held off so far as I am wary of breaking 
something. This is a fairly fundamental part of the daemon and I know that 
while I can confidently tackle a specific problem, I don't want a lack of 
understanding of the &quot;bigger picture&quot; to shoot anyone's foot off.

I can either go ahead and commit or I can forward the code for inspection if 
anyone could check if there is a possibility of breaking stuff, so any 
comments would be appreciated.

BR

Mick
