Yes, but given the flurry of patches there was no clear release
candidate to test.  The last minute ntp change was pretty major and
there were zero reported test results positive or negative before
shipping.  We should at least have one success report before assuming
a fix is release worthy.

</I>
Seems to me 7 days without a patch should be a minimum before promoting
a release candidate to a release.  Just think of all the folks that
can only test on weekends.  At least try to get a few people to admit
they tested an rc before assuming it is good.

&gt;<i> I agree more time would have been desirable, but I'm not at all sure
</I>&gt;<i> it would have prevented the Garmin driver from getting busted
</I>
No way it would have prevented the breakage.  It might have prevented
shipping a release with the one serious and two fatal problems I have
found so far.

&gt;<i> I don't agree.  Or. at least, I think our recent 2.x releases announced as
</I>&gt;<i> stable have been pretty good.  I'm judging this by what I see in my mailbox
</I>&gt;<i> after the releases.
</I>
Clearly we don't agree.

&gt;<i> The ideal solution would be for the problem children to be hooked up
</I>&gt;<i> to a machine with a test-guest account that devs can ssh into and try
</I>&gt;<i> out gpsd builds on.  Would that be possible with your Garmins?
</I>
I did have both hooked up and online before my unfortuneate change of
circumstances.  My goal is to get back to something like that in the
next few months.  I am still living out of boxes and gpsd has to come
behind keeping my customers happy.
