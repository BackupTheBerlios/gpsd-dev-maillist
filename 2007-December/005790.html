<PRE>Petr Slansky &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">slansky at usa.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> maybe you know what happens when you unplug and re-plug your serial mouse in
</I>&gt;<i> X-windows under Linux. Mouse doesn't work any more, you have to restart whole
</I>&gt;<i> X-windows to initialise mouse. OK, this was solved recently, you don't need to
</I>&gt;<i> restart X-windows on the latest Linux distributions anymore in 2007 but it was
</I>&gt;<i> needed one or two years ago. (I think mouse sends some signal that it was
</I>&gt;<i> connected and needs initialization but this query was ignored by mouse driver
</I>&gt;<i> for long time).
</I>
I know this works for USB and PS/2 mice now, but I'm doubtful it works for 
real old-fashioned RS-232 mice.  Serial ports are *very* stupid -- an inactive
one isn't readily distinguishable from a disconnected one without keepalive
signalling that most serial devices (especially cheap low-end ones like mice) 
don't supply. 

And serial devices that *do* supply it may do it an one of two or
three different ways -- autoconfiguration is a nightmare.  There are several
reasons USB has just about driven RS232C to extinction  but inability
to supply reliable hotplug signalling may in fact be the biggest.

Nevertheless your point is valid.  In the presence of more modern interfaces
like USB, it is a main goal of gpsd to cope with disconnect/reconnect 
gracefully.  If we're not doing that, something is broken.
 
&gt;<i> gpsd has similar problems with some GPSs, you start gpsd, GPS is detected,
</I>&gt;<i> initialized, it works for some time. You reboot GPS (remove power plug, change
</I>&gt;<i> battery, etc), GPS is initialized, maybe it has possition but it doesn't pass
</I>&gt;<i> information to gpsd, it is invisible for gpsd. You have to restart gpsd to
</I>&gt;<i> start detection process. When you restart gpsd, all connected clients are
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Garmin eTrex in binary mode is an example of GPS that can be detected during
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd start but cannot be reactivated when you &quot;reset&quot; GPS because GPS is
</I>&gt;<i> silent after reset, it needs &quot;wakeup&quot; commands. I think this is missing
</I>&gt;<i> feature in gpsd design. What to do when no data are received for some time
</I>&gt;<i> (timeout). When to start new search for GPS.
</I>
For the reasons outlined above, I plain don't think we can do this for
serial-port mice.  We already do it for USB mice by watching for hotplug
notifications shipped to the gpsd control port.  

Which is the eTrex?
