Eric,

Now that we are clear to work towards 2.36, I am ready
to include my driver for the Jupiter-T board. This
supports the (default at power-on) Oncore output of
the Jupiter-T and the output of a &quot;real&quot; Oncore
UT/UT+.

It probably supports the other Oncore variants (GT and
maybe others) but I can't test these myself.

The Jupiter board is supported (when it speaks its
native binary) by the Zodiac driver and (when it
speaks NMEA) by the basic gpsd NMEA driver.

So, my driver might be able to address item 3 on
Chris's list, unless he has a driver already cooked.

If I can get at some output from the other Oncores, I
can probably accommodate them reasonably easily. My
driver has stubs for ALL the commands/responses in the
Oncore family manual. I have not yet developed support
for the full range of commands as I have no way to
test them.

That said, based on what I have done so far, it would
probably not be too hard to include them.

Unfortunately, my ADSL box at home died and I have had limited access to the 
internet. I tried to send this via my yahoo mail whist at work, but it seems 
to have gone astray. I am resending from my normal account.
