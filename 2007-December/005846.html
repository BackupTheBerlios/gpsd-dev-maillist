<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Next time how about more than 12 hours notice before a release?  I
</I>&gt;<i> suggest at least a 7 day feature freeze for testing.
</I>
You didn't get the release warning nine days ago?

&gt;<i>From esr Wed Dec  5 18:53:58 -0500 2007
</I>&gt;<i>From: &quot;Eric S. Raymond&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">esr at snark.thyrsus.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd-users at lists.berlios.de</A>
</I>&gt;<i>Subject: State of gpsd -- this is a release warning
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's time to do a release.  *Soon* -- like within the next three days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The immediate time pressure comes from the Ubuntu Hardy and Debian
</I>&gt;<i>schedules; basically, if we don't get an update into Debian within
</I>&gt;<i>eight days, getting into the next Ubuntu stable release might get
</I>&gt;<i>rather more difficult.  Our Debian packager isn't clear on whether 
</I>&gt;<i>moving that fast will guarantee us a win, but I'd prefer to maximize
</I>&gt;<i>our chances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Developers should consider this the 48-hour warning.  If you have
</I>&gt;<i>urgent bugfixes, the time to send them is now.
</I>
I said three days, but we didn't actually ship for five days. During
most of that time I was working like crazy on getting the
floating-point problemms in the regression tests fixed, not adding
features.  Actually the *only* new feature added in the run-up to 2.35
was Marc Balmer's revised xgps, which I evaluated as a low risk
because it didn't touch the daemon code.

I was also wondering why I didn't see more fix patches.  I'm guessing
you weren't the only dev to miss the release warning.

I agree more time would have been desirable, but I'm not at all sure
it would have prevented the Garmin driver from getting busted -- I suspect
I broke that while trying to fix a regression in the handling of
Evermore packets.  The fundamental problem wasn't time pressure, it
was the fact that the Garmins have to be live-tested after anything
that touches the packet handling, and you didn't know I was touching
that code.

&gt;<i>                                                     We have released
</I>&gt;<i> many bad versions this same way before and keep making the same rush to
</I>&gt;<i> release.
</I>
I don't agree.  Or. at least, I think our recent 2.x releases announced as 
stable have been pretty good.  I'm judging this by what I see in my mailbox 
after the releases.  

OTOH, I do want us to coordinate better so we don't ship another release
with regressions in the behavior of the problem children.  &quot;Problem children&quot; 
in this context are the GPS types that can't be tested with a static 
regression load, like the Garmins and the still-broken TNT.

The ideal solution would be for the problem children to be hooked up
to a machine with a test-guest account that devs can ssh into and try
out gpsd builds on.  Would that be possible with your Garmins?
