<PRE>Gary Miller has pointed out that the loose release procedures we've been
using create a high risk of shipping broken support for the problem
children, e.g. devices like the Garmins and (still-broken) TnT that cannot 
be verified using a regression-test load.   He has also recommended a
minimum 7-day freeze period between release announcement and release 
so we'll have the time necessary to do the live test on these devices.

He's got a point.  To address it, I've designed a more structured
release procedure which both Chris and Gary have approved.

First, defining some terms.  There are three tiers of code in our tarballs.
Each has a different risk profile.

1) Exterior code

Test clients and test tools: xgps, cgps, gpsfake, gpsprof, sirfmon, etc.
These are at low risk of breakage and are easy to eyeball-check for
correctness -- when they go wrong they tend to do so in obvious ways.
Point errors in a tool don't compromise the other tools or the daemon.

2) Device drivers

Drivers for the individual GPS device types.  Errors in a driver can
be subtle and hard to detect, but they generally break support for one
class of device without affecting others.  Driver maintainers can test
their drivers with high confidence.

3) Core code

Core code is shared among all device types; most notably, it includes
the packet-getter state machine, the channel-management logic, and
the error-modeling code.  Historically these are the three most 
bug-prone areas in gpsd.

We also need to notice that there are two different kinds of devices
with very different risk profiles:

A) Static-testable: These are devices like NMEA and SiRF chipsets that
can be effectively simulated with a test-load file using gpsfake.  We
can verify these with high confidence using a mechanical regression test.

B) The problem children: Garmins and other devices that aren't
static-testable.  Also, in general, the PPS code.  When the
correctness of drivers and core code in handling any of these is
suspect, they have to be live-tested by someone with acess to the
actual device.

The goal of our release procedure is simple: prevent functional regressions.
No device that worked in release N should break in release N+1.  Of course
we also want to prevent shipping broken core code.

For static-testable devices this is fairly easy to ensure.  Now that
we've fixed the problems with ill-conditioned floating-point, the
regression-test suite does a pretty good job of exercising those
drivers and the related core code and producing repeatable results.
Accordingly, I'm fairly sure we will never again ship a release with
serious breakage on NMEA or SiRF devices.

The problem children are another matter.  Right now our big exposure
here is Garmins, but we need to have good procedure in case we get
our TnT support unbroken and for other ill-behaved devices we might
encounter in the future.

Here are the new release-readiness states:

State 0 (red): There are known blocker bugs,  Blocker bugs include functional
regressions in core or driver code.  

State 1 (blue): There are no known blocker bugs.  'make testregress' passes, but
problem-children have not been live-tested. 

State 2 (yellow): There are no known blocker bugs.  'make testregress'
passes.  Problem children have been live-tested.  From this state, we
drop back to state 1 if anyone commits a logic change to core code or
the driver for a problem child.  In state 2, devs with release
authority (presently myself, Chris, and Gary) may ship a release
candidate at any time.

State 3 (green): We've been in state 2 for 7 days.  In state 3, a dev 
with release authority can call a freeze for release.

State 4: (freeze): No new features that could destabilize existing code.  
Release drops us to state 3.

When you do something that changes our release state -- in particular,
when you commit a patch that touches core or a problem-child driver
at state 2 -- you must notify the dev list.

Anyone notifying the list of a blocker bug drops us back to state 0.

When you announce a state change on the dev list, do it like this:

     Red light: total breakage in Garmin USB, partial breakage in Garmin serial
     Blue light: no known blockers, cosmetic problems in xgps
     Yellow light: Garmins tested successfully 20 Dec 2007
     Green light: I'm expecting to call freeze in about 10 days
     Freeze: Scheduled release date 1 Feb 2008
