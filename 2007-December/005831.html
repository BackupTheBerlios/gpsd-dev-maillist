Well the imminent release of 2.35 scared me to dig to the bottom of my
moving boxes of stuff to dig out my Garmins.  I hated to see a release
go out without some testing.  Have not tested the PPS yet and last I
knew that was also broken in SVN.

&gt;<i> Are you talking about packet.c?  I looked in the change history of garmin.c
</I>&gt;<i> but didn't see anything that raised a red flag.
</I>
Yep.  Anything that touches DLE handling scares me.

&gt;<i> Once you get this fixed, please give me a regression-test load in Garmin USB
</I>&gt;<i> protocol so we can check for Garmin USB not being broken before release.
</I>
Not sure how to do that.  Being a binary protocol with kernel
dependencies and interlocking commands is a bit beyond the regression
engine last I looked.

&gt;<i> Also, we need to talk about endianness problems.  It looks to me like
</I>&gt;<i> garmin.c is rife with them, as a result of the naive struct unpacking
</I>&gt;<i> that their tech docs recommend.  Is there something I'm missing here?
</I>
Someone went over it with a close attention to that and only found
2 endian issues.  All the basic PVT data are known good on either
endianness.  The simple patch was sent to the mailing list several months
ago and I don't know if they were applied.  I now have a PowerPC so if
gpsd still compiles on an Apple I can test then.
