<PRE>Yo Gary,

OK, point taken. I have been working on a system where I have access to a 
public timeserver, which maybe not everyone can do (mobile or no broadband).

A few weeks ago when I had better reception I was playing with 1pps in general 
and tried different scenarios. If I did not have ntp servers accessible, then 
it was hard to get synch since you have to be quite close (about 500 ms) or 
its game over.

I played with the ntp.conf files so that I could iron out the delay in my NMEA 
derived time signal. I got initial lock from the public servers and then let 
it stabilise so I could get a decent figure for the delay on the serial 
stream.

I found it was quite steady, so I took most of the delay out with a fudge 
entry. I then got very close agreement between 1pps, serial data and external 
servers. Ntpd settled with the time sources in that selection order and all 
turning in a reach of 377 and low delay/dispersion figures.

I suppose someone starting up with a clock of indeterminate value and iffy 
stability might easily not get good lock without external time sources.

In that case, is there anything we can do along the lines I coded that could 
avoid having to burn in a polarity? It would be nice to have a general 
solution as we had before.

Best Regards

Mick Durkin
