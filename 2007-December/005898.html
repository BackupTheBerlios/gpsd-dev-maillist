<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I have been the head CVS weenie at my group at BBN since 1995, and we only
</I>&gt;<i> this year started going anything else, valuing stability over new features,
</I>&gt;<i> and the new thing is svn.
</I>
Not a bad choice in a corporate environment, in my fairly informed opinion.
 
&gt;<i> Is it really disconnected operation that one gets, or the ability of
</I>&gt;<i> non-commiters to publish their branches.
</I>
Well, what motivates *me* to think about the change is disconnected operation.

&gt;<i>                                            I realize that it's sort of
</I>&gt;<i> the same thing, but I do work on projects with cvs and svn on the train
</I>&gt;<i> pretty frequently and don't have a problem.  The big issue is merging,
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't see that any of this avoids merge conflicts.
</I>
No, it doesn't.  On the other hand, all the 3G systems have merge tracking
and Subversion doesn't.  This may not present to you as an issue because
you're so recently from CVS-land, but it does tend to cut down on the 
handwork involved in merges across a bushy branch tree a *lot*.

That said, I don't think merge tracking is a big issue for *this* project.
Historically, commit conflicts have been quite rare and we have not needed 
or used branching.

&gt;<i> All that said, the ability of &quot;users&quot; to publish branches and let them
</I>&gt;<i> be merged to the trunk is nice.  I wonder what the experience has been
</I>&gt;<i> (in projects like gpsd) of those non-committing users actually getting
</I>&gt;<i> the tool set up enough to do this.
</I>
I don't think moving to Mercurial, or something like it, necessarily
changes a project's user/committer distinction.  One of the ways you
can play this game is to put access control on a Mercurial repo so you
control who has push privileges.  They then function exactly like commit 
rights in the SVN world, except you're pushing multi-commit histories
rather than single commits.

&gt;<i> I have been a user and very very minor contributor to guile-gnome, and
</I>&gt;<i> they've changed version-control systems several times, perhaps only from
</I>&gt;<i> cvs to arch to bzr.  Every time I had trouble getting set up (and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> moderately clueful :-), mostly because things were underdocumented and
</I>&gt;<i> because they kept moving to bleeding edge, boutiquish,
</I>&gt;<i> flavor-of-the-month tools.
</I>
I understand the problem.  That's why one of my desiderata is good
documentation and a simple, accessible UI.  One of the things drawing
me towards Mercurial is that it seems to have both.

Note, by the way, that there is one other criterion that often knocks out
other 3G systems like Monotone but about which I refuse to be worried.
That's performance.  Ours is simply not a large enough codebase for
that to be an issue.
