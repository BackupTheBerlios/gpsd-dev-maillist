<PRE>Eric/Chris/Gary,

I have submitted a patch to libgpsd-core.c which addresses the problem caused 
by the strange pps output of the GPSClock-200.

The new code should now accept the two original formats, &quot;proper&quot; 1pps and the 
0.5 Hz squarewave as before. It should also add the 1Hz square wave of the 
GPSClock-200 where only the rising edge is to be used.

I wanted to preserve the original code's polarity insensitivity as this is a 
real bonus when we can't predict what a chipset will produce or if a user 
will use any inverting buffers.

To do this I used a bit of a cheat. The 1pps edge must be VERY close to the 
top of the PC internal clock's second to be accepted. This is already tested 
in ntpshm.c and the limit imposed there is that it must be within 100 
milliseconds.

Using that justification, I have coded libgpsd-core.c to check the timestamp 
of each of the 1 Hz waveform's transitions and allow through the one which is 
within (a fairly arbitrary) 110 milliseconds of the second. On that basis, 
the &quot;wrong&quot; transition ought to be about 500 milliseconds away from the 
second.

I believe this is a reasonable test as it does not override the testing in 
ntpshm.c, giving that code the last word.

I have checked that this does not break splint or testregress. I also offered 
some live output from my gps device and its 1pps (conventional format) was 
accepted.

I have such crappy reception at the moment that I can't do a lot of testing, 
but it passes the eyeball test. I would appreciate anybody who can do so 
giving it a thrashing, probably Gary at least.

Question is can we get any square wave data into it? If we can do so and get 
some confidence, we can then ask Michael St. Laurent to try it on the 
GPSClock-200.

I briefly discussed this with Eric off line and if it works, he suggests we go 
this way and probably back out the GPSClock-200 stuff that was put in 
initially.

Best Regards

Mick Durkin
