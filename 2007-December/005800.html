<PRE>Mick Durkin &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">mick.durkin at saunalahti.fi</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> This variable is fully described as &quot;session-&gt;context-&gt;fixcnt&quot; and gets 
</I>&gt;<i> incremented in libgpsd_core.c in the codeblock:-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> gps_mask_t gpsd_poll(struct gps_device_t *session)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The critical line is around line 743 and reads:-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	session-&gt;context-&gt;fixcnt++;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is fine, but it appears to me that this will be executed everytime any 
</I>&gt;<i> packet is handled cleanly by gpsd_poll.
</I>
Look at the guard on it:

	/* count good fixes */
	if (session-&gt;gpsdata.status &gt; STATUS_NO_FIX) 
	    session-&gt;context-&gt;fixcnt++;

&gt;<i>      I would have expected this 
</I>&gt;<i> incrementing to be conditionalised so it applied only when an actual fix 
</I>&gt;<i> packet is handled, as this general path is also trodden by other valid 
</I>&gt;<i> packets such as manufacturer specific admin and control packets.
</I>
That's the intent of the guard.  It's the responsibility of the driver 
for each gps type to set the status field correctly.

&gt;<i> To ensure it was not just an artefact of my jupiter driver, I triggered the 
</I>&gt;<i> device into its native Navman mode which is captured by the existing Zodiac 
</I>&gt;<i> driver and I see the same effect. Here is a description of what I saw:-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A genuine fix packet (message 1000 - geodetic position status output) arrived 
</I>&gt;<i> which resulted in a pseudo NMEA GPGGA being generated from the Zodiac data 
</I>&gt;<i> and fixcnt was incremented (as we would expect).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then came a non-fix packet (message 1002 - channel summary), which resulted
</I>&gt;<i> in a pseudo NMEA PRWIZCH being generated and fixcnt was again incremented.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not what I expected.
</I>
Ouch.  I think I see the problem.  That guard test is not quite right.   It's
testing whether we think we have a have a valid fix for this reporting cycle,
but fixcnt should only be incremented when the last packet received was an
*actual fix*.

&gt;<i> Is this indeed a fault, or have I grasped the principle wrongly? I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think  so, as we use fixcnt to determine whether or not to use the 1pps data
</I>&gt;<i> in libgpsd_core.c around line 166 like this:-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	if ( session-&gt;context-&gt;fixcnt &gt; 3 ) {
</I>
And this will seldom go wrong, because on most devices (e,g SiRFs)
non-fix packets are rare.  The Rockwell chipset in your NavMan is one
of the exceptions on which non-fix packet aren't rare, which is why
you noticed it.  Well spotted.

This is a design flaw.  It's not a serious one: worst case is that it
could cause PPS data to be considered valid maybe a cycle or two
early.  But it's real, and I'll add it to the list of known bugs.

Might be that the drivers need to increment fixcnt themselves.
