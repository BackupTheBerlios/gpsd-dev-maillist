Thinking aloud:

DOP is dimensionless. A scaling factor. A bullshit meter, even. The
gps firmware could take some rough measurements, make some sketchy
assumptions, kick out a solution to 12 decimal places and be almost
justified in doing so, as long as an honest DOP came with the
solution.

GPS says &quot;Mick Durkin, I estimate your position to be *exactly* at the
center of the earth. I am willing to admit that I could be wrong, but
I am at least 95% confident that you are within 6500km of this point.&quot;
That's kind of OK - the gps says it could be very wrong about that
guess. It might've been nicer to say that it had no fix. I guess
6500km might be acceptable error when you're flying all the way across
the galaxy - not as much when you're trying to navigate around an
unfamilar city.

Within commercial GPS firmwares, I suspect DOP is not solely computed
based on overall constellation geometry. Signal strength and SV
position probably weight the calculation in some proprietary way.

Quite a number of receivers simply say &quot;if DOP is greater than magic
number X, you have no fix&quot; - for SiRF I believe this number is 50,
ublox I think it's 99.9. That's fair, since 50 * 2m = 100m = specified
precision of GPS SPS. If your error estimate is larger than that, your
solution is basically worthless.

Given that, if we calculate DOP to be large (ie. there is likely to be
a lot of error in the solution), or we are able to calculate an
unpleasantly large error estimate, I think we're probably justified in
setting fix type to FIX_NONE.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
