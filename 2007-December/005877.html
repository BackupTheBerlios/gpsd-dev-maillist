<PRE>As I was taking the lead on this project back in in 2004, one of the 
joint decisions the 1.x maintainers and I made during the transition
was to move the project from CVS to Subversion.  That, indeed, is the
reason we ended up on Berlios -- it was one of the very first hosting
sites to offer Subversion, which had just recently reached production 
status and was then the hot new thing in version control.

Moving to Subversion was a good decision for 2004.  It lived up to its
early promise, and has since deservedly become the single most widely used
version-control system in the open-source world.  It has served us
well, and I think we could continue using it for many years.  But
I also think the time has come to move on.

There is a new generation of VCS (version-control system) out there
that support disconnected operation.  That is, you don't have to be on
the Internet to a central repository to do commits.  Instead, each
working copy of a project is a peer repository; the fundamental
operation is a repository merge that preserves the change histories
from both repos.

Disconnected operation is a good thing in general (you can do commits 
on an airplane and push them to a master repo when you land), but it's 
especially appropriate for *this* project.  We, more than most other
projects, tend to have developers and contributors working in odd,
remote locations where Internet access is spotty (and packet latencies
when it *is* available make conversation with a central repo awkwardly
slow).

For this reason, I have been thinking about moving the gpsd project to one
of the third-generation distributed VCSes: arch, monotone,
bzr, git, darcs, or Mercurial.

Now, as it happens, I *like* thinking about version-control systems.
I've been interested in them ever since SCCS, and it is not by
accident that I came to write Emacs VC mode in 1992.  In fact I
recently rewrote VC almost completely to fix some serious deficiencies
in its handling of changeset-oriented VCSes; the results are in Emacs
CVS now and will ship with version 23.

So I'm not going to do any such transition casually.  I'm researching
the strengths and weaknesses of these different systems and have
started writing (for publication) an in-depth technical comparison of
their fundamental concepts and their interfaces.  

I also don't intend to make the decision alone.  Switching will
impose transition costs on our entire dev group, and the devs should
therefore have a say in whether we acatually move and what we move to.

I have more research to do, but here is how I see the options before
us at this time:

* We could stick with Subversion.  Advantages: Zero transition costs,
proven technology, strong development community.  Disadvantages: No
disconnected operation.

* monotone, darcs:  These seem to me to have similar strengths
and weaknesses.  Both very innovative in their time, both suffering
from an overly theoretical focus and small development communities.
Neither has scored significant design wins among major projects.

* arch: all the advantages and disadvantages above plus an absolutely
hideous UI and a maintainer/author who's notoriously flaky.  Give him
credit for being first, though --  arch was doing the distributed
thing when even *Subversion* wasn't off the ground then.

* bzr: Seems like a good clean design and has some nice medium-scale
design wins to prove it -- GNU Mailman and Drupal are two of them.
Importantly, it has the backing of Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical,
which I think is a pretty good guarantee it'll stick around.  I'd
probably be happy with this choice.

* git: The Linux kernel and X both use this.  It has some unique
strengths including a really obsessive focus on detecting data
corruption.  But, frankly, git scares me.  Linus has admitted that
he was really only interested in writing a content-addressible
filesystem, and the VCS layers above that seem to me to be 
excessively complicated, tricky and ad-hoc.  Nor is it well
documented.  My instincts say &quot;minefield&quot;.

* Mercurial: Clean design, carefully thought out primitives and
storage engine, simple interface, good documentation, and some major
design wins including Firefox and OpenSolaris.  I've been doing a lot
of digging and even Mercurial's competitors have a visibly hard time
finding anything wrong with it; notably, it's the only other VCS Linus
Torvalds mentioned with approval during the now-notorious Google tech
talk in which he roundly trashed CVS, Subversion, Perforce, and
everything else in sight.

I lean towards Mercurial, with bzr as a strong runner-up.  But I
haven't yet used any of these for production, and would like to hear
from any other devs with opinions or (even better) experience.

It may be that our biggest transition problem would be finding
a place to host the repo.  None of the big hosting sites offer these
yet.  I have a service request in at Berlios but no idea when
or if I'll ever get a response.
