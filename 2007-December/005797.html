<PRE>Russ Nelson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nelson at crynwr.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I thought I'd get gpsd-2.34 running on the OLPC with my new UT-41 USB
</I>&gt;<i> GPS receiver.  I noticed a couple of things:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I didn't make it into the CREDITS section of the README even though
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in the 1.07 CHANGELOG.  I was also maintainer at the time.
</I>
Now says:

    Russ Nelson maintained gpsd for a couple of years.

What else should I add?

&gt;<i> 2) INSTALL doesn't actually say anything about installing gpsd.  It
</I>&gt;<i> only tells you how to compile it.
</I>
New step:

    8. Now that you've verified that the code is working, &quot;make install&quot; 
    will install it it in the system directories.  &quot;make uninstall&quot; will
    undo this.

(You won't need to &quot;make install&quot; if you installed from a binary package.)

&gt;<i> 3) libtools leaves the actual binaries in .libs and replaces the
</I>&gt;<i> putative binaries with shell scripts that pretend to be the
</I>&gt;<i> executables.  That's fine unless you're cross compiling, at which
</I>&gt;<i> point you have to peer through the layering, so how does the layering
</I>&gt;<i> help you?  It doesn't; it hinders.
</I>
Don't you remember how loudly I howled when I got forced into using libtool
back in 2004?  I didn't want to, but it turns out to be nigh-impossible
to build shared libraries under Linux without it.  

Really the whole autotools mess is an abomination, a pile of overengineering.
But we're stuck with it because there's no simpler alternative that solves
the portability problems it does -- which are no longer about cross-platform
builds but more about how you cope with not knowing what set of libraries and
headers your build platform will be carrying.
 
&gt;<i> 4) In spite of what INSTALL says, it's not sufficient to run ./gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> with no options.  It says:
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: can't run with neither control socket nor devices
</I>
Now says:

    4. Start gpsd.  You'll need to give it as an argument a path to 
    a serial or USB port with a GPS attached to it.
