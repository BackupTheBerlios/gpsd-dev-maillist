<PRE>Hi,

esr said:-
&quot;I think I have a simpler fix in trunk now. &#160;Mick, you might want to 
re-review that code.&quot;


Eric,

Yeah that looks better. However, due to my unfortunate location, I suffer from 
crap reception which really helps testing the behaviour during 
initialisation, marginal operation and re-acquisition. Whilst testing, I 
noticed that I still get fixcnt increments at inappropriate times.

Specifically, the new code allows fixcnt to increment on every received 
navigation message. In the case of low/missing signal, my chipset still 
outputs a navigation message every second, but internally flags it as &quot;no 
fix&quot;. This in itself is handled correctly by apps such as xgps since they 
check the fix status variable (which is being correctly set).

Since the design philosophy seems to be that we make no assumptions and fake 
no data, then these messages should still be generated and the status should 
be used to guard them. To that end I would suggest that we modify things to 
account for the validity of the fix as well as the presence of a navigation 
message when bumping fixcnt.

I have submitted a patch to do so which works quite nicely on my setup.

BR
Mick
