<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Good to see the list is working again.
</I>
It was me.  Configuration error in in my Postfix main.cf -- though I actually
think Mailman should have coped more gracefully with this one.
 
&gt;<i> I found that my problem with Garmin Serial Binary and PPS was a broken wire
</I>&gt;<i> in my cable during the move.  So PPS and Garmin Serial Binary seem to
</I>&gt;<i> work for me first pass.  My ntp server is now stable within a few uS and
</I>&gt;<i> when chiming to other public stratum ones seems to be accurate to better
</I>&gt;<i> than a mS for the first time in many, many, months.
</I>
Good!
 
&gt;<i> I do see a few issues with that setup.  The &quot;Speed Err&quot; seems to hang around
</I>&gt;<i> several hundred mph!
</I>
That smells like yet another floating-point issue in the error
modeling with roundoff or NaN-guards not being quite good enough.

(Eric stares at the code...)

OK, I put stronger NaN-guarding on that computation and it passes all regression
tests.  Sync up and see if it solves the problem?

General question to the list: is anyone else seeing this?  Negative
reports would be as valuable as positive ones -- if not, then it's
probably a driver-specific issue.

&gt;<i>               Also if I try to background gpsd by not using the
</I>&gt;<i> - -N command line option the daemon crashes and needs a 'kill -9',
</I>
That sounds like a hang rather than a crash.  Which is it?  (Not
reproducing here.)

&gt;<i> When I try the current SVN on the Garmin USB the process gets through the
</I>&gt;<i> initialization process but never gets any fursther packets.  Probably
</I>&gt;<i> a handshake issue.  The Garmin USB and Garmin Serial handshakes are not
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the same.
</I>
Handshake at what level?  The packet getter?
