<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I think merge tracking is important, and I had forgotten about that.
</I>&gt;<i> People are scared of branches in general, and life would be better with
</I>&gt;<i> multiple active developers if they got used more.
</I>
Probably.
 
&gt;<i> Agreed.  My concern was whether users without commit bits would manage
</I>&gt;<i> to get set up with the tool and make progress.  In the guile-gnome case,
</I>&gt;<i> I did not - it was too hard and not worth it for me.
</I>
Hm.  I'm not sure I get it.  What's hard about &quot;hg init; hg pull {URL}&quot;?
I don't imagine the bzr equivalent can be much more difficult.
 
&gt;<i> I think performance has to be good enough to make operation with a
</I>&gt;<i> codebase the size of NetBSD (1 GB of source) feasible, because otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> the tool risks not having enough global mindshare in the end.
</I>
Good point.  I strongly suspect that monotone fails that threshold and
that said failure is going to kill off monotone, which is a shame --
there are some truly good ideas in it.

****BOINNNNGGGG!!!******      &lt;- Eric has a moment of enlightenment.

You just changed my thinking in a significant way.  You reminded 
me of something I'd temporarily forgotten -- that this is exactly the kind
of technological competition is which network-value effects tend to 
amplify small leads into runaway victories.

You also started a chain of thought in my head which led me to the
conclusion that all the DVCSes in competition to be the next svn-like
runaway winner -- hg, git, bzr, darcs, arch, monotone, and (maybe)
codeville -- are under hideous time pressure.  

My gut feeling is that the hackers-at-large out there are nearly ready
to pick a winner (that is, a DVCS replacement for Subversion initially on new
projects and eventually on everything) -- six months behind me at *most*.

That means a couple of things.  One: any of these that aren't 
production-quality systems now haven't got a snowball's chance
in hell of gaining enough ground to win against the ones that 
already are, even if they might have enough superior ideas to
win in a longer timeframe.

And *that* has grim implications for monotone, darcs, Codeville, and Arch.
They're all full of very interesting ideas being pursued by fiendishly
clever people (darcs patch theory, Codeville's precise merge,
monotone's lifecycle inode tracking) but they are not
production-quality systems.  

Arch is in some kind of what-the-hell-is-Tom-Lord-doing limbo,
monotone is too slow, darcs has a deep nasty conflict-resolution bug
that their devs think is going to require a core rewrite to fix, and
Codeville is so feature-incomplete that I probably shouldn't have
listed it as a competitor to begin with.  Say bye-bye to 'em all;
If I'm right they're already out of contention.  Ouch!

The same logic pretty much excludes the possibility that a new design
is going to come out of nowhere and dazzle everybody.  There isn't
even time for these promising lab experiments to catch up before one
of the production-quality DVCSes reaches the runaway-victory
Subversion-replacing stage, let alone someone starting from scratch
today.

So, I am now *much* more confident than I was an hour ago that it's 
going to come down to the three systems that are production quality now;
hg, git, and bzr.

Some possible outcomes:

hg wins: Nope, not while the kernel and X are welded to git.

bzr wins: Nope, not while the kernel and X are welded to git.

git wins: Nope, not unless git pulls its UI act together.  Right now
it's enough more complicated to use than svn to be unable to eat svn's
lunch (unless, say, you're Linus Torvalds or Keith Packard).  And if
there were anyone working on a git UI with clue #1 about interface
design we'd already be seeing results from it.

bzr + hg duopoly: Nope, git still has the kernel and X.

hg + git duopoly: possible.

bzr + git duopoly: possible.

hg + bzr + git triopoly: possible.

So the next question is, can we choose a most likely among these last
three scenarios?  And that's where your speed criterion comes back.
Ain't nobody claiming with a straight face that hg isn't significantly
faster than bzr -- even the the bzr devs' bzr-vs.-git page only claims
they're in the process of catching up.

Of such small leads are runaway victories made in situation like this.
It's even nastier for the one behind because bzr-&gt;hg and hg-&gt;bzr are
so functionally similar that migrations between them are easy.  It
means people are going to bail out of the loser's user community fast
as soon as it starts looking like a loser.

Most likely outcome, therefore, is that it's hg + git that effectively replaces
Subversion for new projects, within the next year.

Just to be clear, my previous theory was that we'd get a single
winner, most likely hg but possibly bzr, but that it could take longer
and any of the DVCSes might slip in there.

This projection can fail in two obvious ways: 

1) The hackers hold off picking a winner longer than I think they will.
That would open up the field.

2) Canonical's marketing juju is a bigger advantage than hg's speed.  
In that case we land at bzr + git.

3) One of the contenders develops a brown-paper-bag bug and gets
laughed out of town.  Unlikely.

&gt;<i>                                                                     One of
</I>&gt;<i> the nice things about cvs is that everyone knows it and has it installed
</I>&gt;<i> already, so the barrier to doing a checkout is very low.  svn is at that
</I>&gt;<i> level now.
</I>
Yeah.  I'm less worried about this, because I think hg and git and bzr 
are going to reach &quot;it's always there&quot; in every major Linux distro's
next release.  If you don't think a package install is painful, they already
have.

&gt;<i> &gt; From what you tell me, I can make a pretty confident guess that the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CVS-to-Arch transition was quite painful (poor documentation, overly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complex UI on the Arch end) and Arch to bzr came as something of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a relief even though it caused transient headaches.  Have I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; called that correctly?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More or less, but what I should have said was that I basically gave up,
</I>&gt;<i> and this was part of it.  The other part was that people seemed more
</I>&gt;<i> interested in playing with VCSs than having releases that users could
</I>&gt;<i> use.
</I>
Always a danger when you dangle shiny things in front of geeks.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm learning a lot more; in fact I'm writing a survey paper on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state of the VCS art -- good thing for me to be doing while Gary works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the Garmin blockers.  Last night I had a *fascinating* IRC conversation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with Graydon Hoare, author of Monotone.  The guy knows where all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bodies in this technical area are buried, and he has excellent taste...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great - I look forward to reading it.  That will be a significant
</I>&gt;<i> contribution.
</I>
I hope so.  It's not entirely beyond the bounds of possibility that such
a survey published at the right moment might decide the winner, though 
that's not why I'm writing it.
