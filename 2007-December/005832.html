<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Are you talking about packet.c?  I looked in the change history of garmin.c
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but didn't see anything that raised a red flag.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep.  Anything that touches DLE handling scares me.
</I>
Ouch.  That was me, commit 4458. I made a small change because we were
failing to get lock on an Evermore packet with spurious leading DLEs.
(that's test 15 in packet_test).  Chris's r4432 might be implicated, too;
I haven't looked at it, but the TSIP driver uses DLE-led packets too.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Once you get this fixed, please give me a regression-test load in Garmin USB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol so we can check for Garmin USB not being broken before release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure how to do that.  Being a binary protocol with kernel
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies and interlocking commands is a bit beyond the regression
</I>&gt;<i> engine last I looked.
</I>
A simple binary capture of 15 seconds or so of incoming data while the
GPS has a fix would do it (best if it's moving so we get a couple
different fixes and some nonzero velocity fields).  That way the
regression tests could at least check that packet decoding isn't
broken.  This sort of thing is why we have a super-raw mode.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Also, we need to talk about endianness problems.  It looks to me like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; garmin.c is rife with them, as a result of the naive struct unpacking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that their tech docs recommend.  Is there something I'm missing here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Someone went over it with a close attention to that and only found
</I>&gt;<i> 2 endian issues.  All the basic PVT data are known good on either
</I>&gt;<i> endianness.  The simple patch was sent to the mailing list several months
</I>&gt;<i> ago and I don't know if they were applied.  I now have a PowerPC so if
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd still compiles on an Apple I can test then.
</I>
I don't have the fix patch, whatever it was; I don't think I ever saw it.
