&gt;&gt;<i> I realize that it's sort of the same thing, but I do work on projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with cvs and svn on the train pretty frequently and don't have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem.  The big issue is merging, and I don't see that any of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avoids merge conflicts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, it doesn't.  On the other hand, all the 3G systems have merge tracking
</I>&gt;<i> and Subversion doesn't.  This may not present to you as an issue because
</I>&gt;<i> you're so recently from CVS-land, but it does tend to cut down on the 
</I>&gt;<i> handwork involved in merges across a bushy branch tree a *lot*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I don't think merge tracking is a big issue for *this* project.
</I>&gt;<i> Historically, commit conflicts have been quite rare and we have not needed 
</I>&gt;<i> or used branching.
</I>
I think merge tracking is important, and I had forgotten about that.
People are scared of branches in general, and life would be better with
multiple active developers if they got used more.

&gt;&gt;<i> All that said, the ability of &quot;users&quot; to publish branches and let them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be merged to the trunk is nice.  I wonder what the experience has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (in projects like gpsd) of those non-committing users actually getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tool set up enough to do this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think moving to Mercurial, or something like it, necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> changes a project's user/committer distinction.  One of the ways you
</I>&gt;<i> can play this game is to put access control on a Mercurial repo so you
</I>&gt;<i> control who has push privileges.  They then function exactly like commit 
</I>&gt;<i> rights in the SVN world, except you're pushing multi-commit histories
</I>&gt;<i> rather than single commits.
</I>
Agreed.  My concern was whether users without commit bits would manage
to get set up with the tool and make progress.  In the guile-gnome case,
I did not - it was too hard and not worth it for me.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have been a user and very very minor contributor to guile-gnome, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they've changed version-control systems several times, perhaps only from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cvs to arch to bzr.  Every time I had trouble getting set up (and I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moderately clueful :-), mostly because things were underdocumented and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because they kept moving to bleeding edge, boutiquish,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flavor-of-the-month tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note, by the way, that there is one other criterion that often knocks out
</I>&gt;<i> other 3G systems like Monotone but about which I refuse to be worried.
</I>&gt;<i> That's performance.  Ours is simply not a large enough codebase for
</I>&gt;<i> that to be an issue.
</I>
I think performance has to be good enough to make operation with a
codebase the size of NetBSD (1 GB of source) feasible, because otherwise
the tool risks not having enough global mindshare in the end.  One of
the nice things about cvs is that everyone knows it and has it installed
already, so the barrier to doing a checkout is very low.  svn is at that
level now.

&gt;<i> From what you tell me, I can make a pretty confident guess that the 
</I>&gt;<i> CVS-to-Arch transition was quite painful (poor documentation, overly
</I>&gt;<i> complex UI on the Arch end) and Arch to bzr came as something of 
</I>&gt;<i> a relief even though it caused transient headaches.  Have I
</I>&gt;<i> called that correctly?
</I>
More or less, but what I should have said was that I basically gave up,
and this was part of it.  The other part was that people seemed more
interested in playing with VCSs than having releases that users could
use.

&gt;<i> I'm learning a lot more; in fact I'm writing a survey paper on the
</I>&gt;<i> state of the VCS art -- good thing for me to be doing while Gary works
</I>&gt;<i> on the Garmin blockers.  Last night I had a *fascinating* IRC conversation
</I>&gt;<i> with Graydon Hoare, author of Monotone.  The guy knows where all the
</I>&gt;<i> bodies in this technical area are buried, and he has excellent taste...
</I>
Great - I look forward to reading it.  That will be a significant
contribution.
