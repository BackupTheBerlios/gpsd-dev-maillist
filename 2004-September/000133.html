<PRE>After another couple of hard days' work, the issues list has shrunk 
drastically.  Here's what's on it now:

* Testing on EarthMate and TripMate

Would somebody please test the device types that aren't straight NMEA?
(This translates as: Hey, you, Russ!  Get off your tuchis! :-))

Remco has suggested that maybe it's time to forget about this ancient
hardware.  Perhaps he's right.  Thoughts and opinions?

* Should PRWIZCH support drop out entirely?

Along similar lines, at the moment I have the PRWIZCH handling
conditioned out.  I'd like to drop it entirely -- the information it
gives is redundant with the SNRs in GPGSV, and the Zodiac chipset
reported GSVs.  Does anyone know any good reason not to just drop this
code?

* The strange math problem in gpsprobe 

I have a Python script I'd like to ship with 2.0, called gsprobe.  It
watches the NMEA from a GPS and tries to deduce things about the GPS.
It generates a gnuplot scattergram of fixes you can use to empirically
check accuracy against the reported HDOP.

However, something is awry in my calculation of the actual uncertainty 
of position, going from degrees of uncertainty to meters.  I posted about 
this earlier today.  Help!

* Autodetect USB GPS by scanning the USB bus, if no device is specified.

This is a long-term wishlist item.  It's going to be difficult, since there
is no GPS device class yet.

The right of self-defense is the first law of nature: in most
governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right
within the narrowest limits possible.  Wherever standing armies
are kept up, and when the right of the people to keep and bear
arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited,
liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of
destruction.&quot;
