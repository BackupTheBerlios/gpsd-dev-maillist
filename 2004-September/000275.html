<PRE>My current plan is to do a 2.1 cleanup release once I get the patches
fron Jens Oberender that will allow preople configuring from source to
condition out drivers.  There are no actual code changes in the tree
since 2.0, though I did just move some unit-conversion constants from
gpsd.h to gps.h because they should be visible to clients.

I've been trying to clean things off the to-do list.  Working out that
USB device scanning cannot be made to work well enough to be worth
trying removed one.  Lonnie Mendez and Jiang Zhang and I have agreed
that Cypress M8 support belongs at kernel level, so that cleans off 
another.

Here are the remaining to-do list items.  I'm looking for (a) feedback
on whether these are worth pursuing at all, and (b) help if they are.

    * Mine the contrib directory for good ideas

    There is code in there that can do some interesting tricks with
    SiRF-II chipsets.  Lonnie Mendez is working on this.

We have the option to write a driver that would speak SiRF-II binary,
but I'm not sure I see any point in it.  Functionally SiRF binary does
not appear to give us anything we need and don't get from NMEA.  You can take 
a look at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.sectron.cz/md/cz/pro/gps/download/gps_protocol.pdf">http://www.sectron.cz/md/cz/pro/gps/download/gps_protocol.pdf</A>&gt;;
other than (maybe) Push-To-Fix mode, I don't see anything interesting there.

Less radically, we have the option of switching SiRF chips to a higher
baud rate and collecting updates more than once per second.  Do we care?

    * gpsd.py is unsatisfactory

    It only handles straight NMEA devices.  It should be replaced by a
    Python extension built around libgps.a.

I go back and forth about this.  Yes, it would be nice; on the other
hand, the only client for this is currently gpsprobe.

    * Do the research to figure out just what the heck is going on
      with status bits

    NMEA actually has *three* kinds of validity bits.  Mode, status,
    and the Active/Void bit (some sources interpret 'V' as 'Navigation
    receiver warning').  Sentences that have an Active/Void send V
    when there is no fix, so the position data is no good.

    Let's look at which sentences send what:

		    GPRMC     GPGLL     GPGGA     GPGSA
    Returns fix      Yes       Yes       Yes        No
    Returns status   No        Yes       Yes        No
    Returns mode     No        No        No         Yes
    Returns A/V      Yes       Yes       No         No

    In addition, some sentences use empty fields to signify invalid data.

    My first conclusion from looking at this table is that the
    designers of NMEA 0183 should be hung for galloping incompetence.
    But never mind that.  What are we to make of this mess?

    The fact that the FV18 sends GPMRC/GPGLL/GPGGA but not GPGSA
    argues that GPGSA is optional.  I don't see how it can be, since it
    seems to be the only status bit that applies to altitude.  Just how are
    we supposed to know when altitude is valid if it doesn't ship GSA?  
    Can a receiver ever ship a non-empty but invalid altitude?

    Which of these override which other bits?  I don't think status is ever
    nonzero when mode is zero. So status overrides mode.  What other such
    relationships are there?

This is the big one.  gpsd should have a consistent and *documented*
theory of how it interprets state bits and determines when NMEA data
is invalid.  I need help with this.
