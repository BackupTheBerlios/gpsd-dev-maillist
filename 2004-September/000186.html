<PRE>All we're waiting on is for Russ to verify that Derrick's driver-selection
fix moves the Earthmate Zodiac fom &quot;brick&quot; to &quot;working&quot;.  Of course if
I somehow managed to foo up the Zodiac code, there might still be some
debugging to be done.

I found the fix for the strange math problem I was having with
computing distances.  Turns out it was a bug in the C++ code I copied
from Kismet; Mike Kershaw has acknowledged the bug and thanked me for
catching it.

So gpsprobe now ships, it's in 1.97.  You can use it to plot a
scattergram showing the dispersion of fixes from a stationary GPS, and
gpsprobe also reports that dispersion as meters of probable error.

The trunk version of gpsprobe also makes a stab at identifying the GPS
chipset.  Those of you with exotic GPSes like James Cameron's FV18 are
invited to try writing tests that will identify your beasts.  As
gpsprobe is written in Python rather than C, these should not be hard
to code.

Jiang Jay Zhang, the person working on Cypress M8 USB-to-serial
support and the SiRF-II Earthmate, has accepted my invitation to join
the project.  He says he'll join the list next week after he gets back
from traveling.

Today I sent requests for evaluation units to the following
manufacturers of GPS mice: Deluo, Haicom, Royaltek, Leadtek, and
Rikaline.  My hope is that we'll be able to fill out the compatibility
table for 2.0.  If you know of another manufacturer that should be
included, please tell me.
