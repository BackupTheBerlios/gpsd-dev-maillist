<PRE>&gt;<i> Bletch.  Well, then, let's try a different approach,  The part of that 
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> that really interests me is the device scanning.  Once I've got a udev, is
</I>&gt;<i> there any way to get a pathname or conventional read/write file descriptor
</I>&gt;<i> from that?
</I>
    Looking in usb.h yields a function named usb_get_driver_np, which 
returns the name of
the kernel driver currently associated (claiming) the device, if any.  I 
could not find anything which could return a file
descriptor or even an node path for the device which registered with the 
associated kernel driver.

    Another way of doing this could involve parsing some information given 
by procfs, sysfs, etc to
resolve the appropriate node path and obtain a file descriptor.

    procfs provides /proc/tty/driver/usbserial, which contains 
Vendor/Product IDs and most importantly the
minor number listing for each device which can be used to form the node path 
to try and open.  A sample
listing from my vaio:

usbserinfo:1.0 driver:v2.0
0: module:cypress_m8 name:&quot;DeLorme Earthmate USB&quot; vendor:1163 product:0100 
num_ports:1 port:1 path:usb-0000:00:1d.1-1
1: module:pl2303 name:&quot;PL-2303&quot; vendor:067b product:2303 num_ports:1 port:1 
path:usb-0000:00:1d.0-1

This means the earthmate is either at /dev/ttyUSB0 for udev or with manual 
mknod... or at /dev/usb/tts/0 for devfs.  Some people have
special rules in their udev / devfsd config, or bind the node to whatever 
they want manually... not a handled case for this).

An algorithm to formulate a device node path based on the parsed vid/pid and 
minor could be used.  This sounds like the best way, as both
kernels 2.4 - 2.6 have this... I think, and could be used within the bus 
scanning code via libusb.  For the Earthmate, it could break to the libusb
handler since a driver is not available in the mainline kernels (yet).

    sysfs, which I'm sure you know is something new to 2.6, provides 
/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers, which contains folders labeled by driver with
the actual name of the node path the device has been assigned to inside, 
although that does not guarantee the path exists.

   I'm not sure how this is all going to come together in regards to 
tracking the devices as they are being plugged/unplugged.  I know you want 
to track
certain things from within the daemon, etc.  That is all I can think off at 
the moment... maybe there are some libraries out there for determining this
kind of information already, albeit adding another dependency.
