<PRE>Guys,

I have been able to pin down a problem with the 1pps code, but I need a bit of 
help with it. I am not sure if it is caused by a bug, or by the way the 
serial port works on a fundamental level. This is why I need some help to 
clarify the situation. Unfortunately, this is a LONG mail because of the 
nature of the problem and the investigations I had to make.

I have been able to reproduce the fault on two systems under my control, both 
running Fedora, but one is FC6 (2.6.20-1.2948.fc6) and the other is FC7 
(2.6.21-1.3228.fc7). These are both quite close to each other in kernel 
release (2.6.20 and 2.6.21), but I don't have any older system to test it on.

I came across this problem when helping another guy, David Cottle, who is 
acting as a tester for a new driver I am making. He reported mysterious loss 
of detection of the 1pps data stream when the device was producing a steady 
stream. I eventually reproduced the fault here, so it is not a chance fault 
or bad hardware.


1. Initial conditions
=====================

When gpsd fires up from a command like &quot;gpsd /dev/ttyS0&quot;, it scans the 
nominated serial port and tries to recognise the incoming stream of data and 
select the right decoder.

If it cannot match at the initial settings (basically, the settings of the 
port as defined externally to gpsd), it will go through a variety of other 
settings in a fixed order and either find a match somewhere along the way, or 
give up if no rate matches.

As part of the process, before scanning the port, it offers any compiled-in 
drivers who can probe a device, the option to do so. If one of these is 
successful, it gets control. If none are capable of probing or none detect a 
device, the default driver will be used.

In either case, the function gpsd_activate() in libgpsd_core.c will issue a 
message like:-

gpsd: gpsd_activate(1): opened GPS (4)

and then launch a separate thread to monitor the 1pps line with:-

(void)pthread_create(&amp;pt,NULL,gpsd_ppsmonitor,(void *)session);

This new thread will autonomously observe the DCD line and process the 
transitions.

The effect is that on startup, if there are no devices/drivers which are found 
by probing, the gpsd daemon will observe the nominated port initially at the 
preset rate and in parallel monitor the 1pps line.


2. Observed effects first test scenario
=======================================

What follows now depends on:-

a) the externally defined port parameters
b) the data rate of the gps device connected.

To illustrate the problem clearly, I attached a gps device which was 
generating a 19200bps 8N1 stream of Rockwell/Navman data that can be decoded 
by the in-built Zodiac driver. This driver is not a probing driver, so it 
relies on the packet detection state machine in the normal driver to detect 
the packets and invoke the Zodiac driver. My gps was also generating a 
continuous 1pps stream on the DCD line (dependant on it having a valid fix).

I initially set the port using stty to &quot;4800 sane&quot; which equates to 4800 at 
8N1 but with text terminal attributes. This was not an issue, as even though 
gpsd used the default baud rate, it automatically saved the settings, forced 
8N1 and set it to expect a non-text data stream. This was done by a call:-

gpsd_set_speed(session, gpsd_get_speed(&amp;session-&gt;ttyset_old), 'N', 1);

I also added much instrumentation to the code to observe interesting things, 
especially the serial data setting events. However, I did not disturb the 
logic of the basic code. I also modified the reporting level of a few inbuilt 
reports.

On starting the daemon with &quot;gpsd -nND4&quot;, there were no probe results, so it 
settled into the default driver and launched the 1pps monitoring thread. Note 
that this thread launch took place AFTER an initial call:-

gpsd_set_speed(session, gpsd_get_speed(&amp;session-&gt;ttyset_old), 'N', 1);

It will be seen later that the relative timing of these two events (the 
gpsd_set_speed call and the 1pps thread launch) was critical.

It then tried to read the serial stream at the default settings, which was  
unsuccessful. It then started to scan through the table of baud rates that 
gpsd expects to encounter.

The first of these happens to be 4800, so a critical test early in the 
gpsd_set_speed function in serial.c failed (all the parameters matched, so 
the actual hardware parameter update was skipped). This meant that a scan 
then occurred at the same rate as had just been done but WITHOUT a hardware 
parameters update occurring.

This in itself was a bit inefficient, scanning at the same rate as before, but 
it served to illustrate the point that the actual hardware update omission 
was critical.

Throughout the above two scan loops, the 1pps produced a continuous stream of 
asynchronous output, mixed in with the other reports.

Eventually, the scanner timed out again and stepped to the next rate, 9600bps 
and issued a call:-

gpsd_set_speed(session, gpsd_get_speed(&amp;session-&gt;ttyset_old), 'N', 1);

This immediately appeared to terminate the 1pps thread output. At least, there 
was no further data seen from it. I suspect the thread itself did not 
terminate, as I would have expected it to deliver a signoff message (which I 
had added to the code). However, I am not experienced enough with threads to 
be sure of this. Of course, this time the parameters had not matched, so the 
new data was written to the hardware.

The scanner continued to march along and eventually tripped to 19200, where 
the data stream was successfully identified as Zodiac and navigation messages 
were then seen. No 1pps was seen, even though my h/w monitoring LED was still 
flashing away.


3. Observed effects second test scenario
========================================

I then modified the port with stty to be at 2400 bps and repeated the startup 
again. This time, the beginning was the same and the port was set to 2400 8N1 
binary mode and the 1pps thread launched. I saw regular 1pps reports and no 
data match. However, when the baud table was scanned, the first entry (4800) 
now no longer matched, so a call was made:-

gpsd_set_speed(session, gpsd_get_speed(&amp;session-&gt;ttyset_old), 'N', 1);

This now terminated the 1pps output.

The scan continued as before until at 19200, navigation messages were detected 
but no 1pps.


4. Conclusions
==============

It looks as though the actual speed switching event is the cause of the 
disappearance of the 1pps, of which the active code in terms of the port 
itself appear to be these lines in serial.c:-

	if (tcsetattr(session-&gt;gpsdata.gps_fd, TCSANOW, &amp;session-&gt;ttyset) != 0)
	    return;
	(void)tcflush(session-&gt;gpsdata.gps_fd, TCIOFLUSH);
	(void)usleep(200000);
	(void)tcflush(session-&gt;gpsdata.gps_fd, TCIOFLUSH);

Note that I have removed a block of comment from the original source here.

So, either tcsetattr or tcflush are the suspects in my book. The MAN entry has 
these remarks to offer:-

&quot;
tcsetattr()	sets  the  parameters  associated with the terminal (unless
		support is required from the underlying hardware that is not available)
		from the termios structure referred to by termios_p.  optional_actions
		specifies when the changes take effect:

TCSANOW		the change occurs immediately.
&quot;


&quot;
tcflush()  	discards  data  written  to  the  object  referred  to  by  fd
		but  not transmitted, or data received but not read, depending on the value
		of queue_selector:

TCIFLUSH	flushes data received but not read.

TCOFLUSH	flushes data written but not transmitted.

TCIOFLUSH	flushes both data received but not read, and data written but not
		transmitted.
&quot;

Of these, I reckon tcsetattr() is the more likely cause.


5. Possible workaround or solution
==================================

As a workaround until I could resolve the cause, I extracted the 1pps thread 
launching code in gpsd_activate (in libgpsd_core.c) into a separate function. 
I then arranged to call this new function from inside gpsd_assert_sych in 
serial.c. My thinking was that the gpsd_assert_synch function is not called 
until a valid gps device is detected and, until that time, 1pps signals are 
of limited value.

If the problem I encountered is insurmountable or is actually how the serial 
port should work, my workaround is one possible way to modify gpsd.


6. Advice and support needed
============================

As I said earlier, I am not a serial port or kernel guru, so I would 
appreciate some more-experienced developers' opinions on my work. I attach 
the logs I generated using my instrumented code. I have shortened the prints 
where the 1pps is generating log streams of data while the port is being 
scanned for a match at each serial rate.


The lines containing data like:-

00000000:00000004:00000cbb:00008a38:03:1c:7f:15:04:00:01:00:11:13:1a:00:12:0f:17:16

are hex dumps of the termios structure fields c_iflag, c_oflag, c_cflag, 
c_lflag and c_cc[0] to c_cc[15] which contain the interesting serial port 
data at different points in the process.

The remaining output relates to other important locations passed through by 
the code, mostly already reporting points in the original code.

I ran the same two tests with much higher debug levels, but the only extra 
data I saw were meaningless bytes being read and discarded at each serial 
speed.
