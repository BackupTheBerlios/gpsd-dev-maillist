<PRE>All,

I took my checking a bit further and put in some new report statements which 
show which line in the stock serial.c we are about to execute, each followed 
by a sleep(3) statement. This allows the 1pps a chance to show if it is still 
alive before actually executing the statement.

Here is what I see now when the critical speed change comes along and 
re-programs the serial port.

gpsd:  : serial.c       : gpsd_set_speed, about to execute line 122 (actually 
next active line is 172)
gpsd: speed 9600, 8N1
...
No further output so I killed the daemon.
...
gpsd: closing GPS=/dev/ttyS0 (4)
gpsd: Received terminating signal 2. Exiting...


So it looks like the actual tcsetattr() at line 120 is what kills the 1pps. I 
noticed a partial mail in the latest gpsd-dev daily digest (not shown on the 
on-line berlios archive for some reason) which has no &quot;from&quot; header, but is 
signed by Rob, which says this:-

&quot;What probably happens is that the pps monitor hangs indefinitely in the
TIOCMIWAIT ioctl waiting for a state change on the DCD line, that is no
longer detected after the port has been re-programmed. &#160;But that probably
depends very much on the serial port driver.&quot;

I assume that this is from Rob Janssen as there are a couple of other mails 
from him. It looks like we agree on the cause of the 1pps disappearing.

The question is now though, which of the following is true?

1) We killing the 1pps in gpsd ourselves because of our ordering of events and 
the behaviour of the serial port is ok. In other words, you can't expect the 
DCD transition events to be still detected after re-programming the port.

2) This a bug in the kernel that should be reported to the kernel maintainers.

Anyone care to step up to the mark and say which it is?

Mick Durkin
