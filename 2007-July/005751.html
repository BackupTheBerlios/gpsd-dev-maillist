<PRE>All,

I posted this report back on 29/6/2007 and so far no comment at all...

Maybe it got missed at the month end?

Still, I would welcome some comments on this as I still think what I observed 
is not correct.

Thanks

Mick Durkin

p.s. Much embarassment! I accidentally posted this to  
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd-dev-request at lists.berlios.de</A>
in error at first!

====================================================================



I am working on a problem with the 1pps and Fedora 7 experienced by David 
Cottle. He is helping me to debug my Jupiter-T driver and as part of our 
testing, I have been heavily instrumenting parts of the code.

Tonight I was tracing the handling of the serial stream, especially in 
relation to the selection mechanism which tries to find a match for the data 
stream with one of the compiled-in packet geometries. This in itself works 
nicely, but I noticed an odd behaviour in the &quot;fixcnt&quot; variable.

This variable is fully described as &quot;session-&gt;context-&gt;fixcnt&quot; and gets 
incremented in libgpsd_core.c in the codeblock:-

gps_mask_t gpsd_poll(struct gps_device_t *session)

The critical line is around line 743 and reads:-

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;session-&gt;context-&gt;fixcnt++;

This is fine, but it appears to me that this will be executed everytime any 
packet is handled cleanly by gpsd_poll. I would have expected this 
incrementing to be conditionalised so it applied only when an actual fix 
packet is handled, as this general path is also trodden by other valid 
packets such as manufacturer specific admin and control packets.

To ensure it was not just an artefact of my jupiter driver, I triggered the 
device into its native Navman mode which is captured by the existing Zodiac 
driver and I see the same effect. Here is a description of what I saw:-

A genuine fix packet (message 1000 - geodetic position status output) arrived 
which resulted in a pseudo NMEA GPGGA being generated from the Zodiac data 
and fixcnt was incremented (as we would expect).

Then came a non-fix packet (message 1002 - channel summary), which resulted in 
a pseudo NMEA PRWIZCH being generated and fixcnt was again incremented. This 
is not what I expected.

Is this indeed a fault, or have I grasped the principle wrongly? I don't think 
so, as we use fixcnt to determine whether or not to use the 1pps data in 
libgpsd_core.c around line 166 like this:-

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if ( session-&gt;context-&gt;fixcnt &gt; 3 ) {

I offer no solution at this point until I am sure I am not &quot;barking up the 
wrong tree&quot;.

Best Regards
Mick Durkin
