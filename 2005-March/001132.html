<PRE>&gt;<i> Might another approach be to let clients &quot;subscribe&quot; to one or more
</I>&gt;<i> talker's &quot;conversations&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example: I have two client programs.  One is interested in GP data.
</I>&gt;<i> Another is interested in both LC and GP data.  In either of these
</I>&gt;<i> cases (assuming both devices are on the bus), the programs would need
</I>&gt;<i> to poll the gpsd server in order to get the data they're interested

</I>&gt;<i> they'd be assured of getting only what they want.  The default would
</I>&gt;<i> be that you're subscribed to everything, but you could change that.
</I>
Is it a good idea to make gpsd mimick NMEA conversations even for devices
that use other protocols?
Maybe it simplifies the adaptation of existing GPS applications that were
designed to read directly from a GPS receiver over a COM port.
However, it also complicates things for receivers that do not use NMEA,
and for applications that are written from scratch and no not yet parse
NMEA sentences.

I like the idea of transferring data between server and client in a simple
syntax as is used now, or maybe in XML when it is to be extended, and
using the client library to provide a function-call API.
