<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok here is a conversion function from broken down gmt/utc time to time_t
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that looks more reasonable than the successive-approximation code in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is from the lynx source and is GPL.  I think it can be copied into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gpsutil.c and the call to mktime replaced by it (and the offset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removed),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oops.  That's a problem.  The license of gpsd is about to change so that
</I>&gt;<i> application code can link libgps without being GPLized.  Including this
</I>&gt;<i> would make that impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, this code is quite buggy.  Look at the first two places result
</I>&gt;<i> is set.  The first one is stepped on by the second one.  The handling
</I>&gt;<i> of negative months also looks broken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having seen this, I think I can write an equivalent that doesn't suck.
</I>
Ok, well I had some cleaner version somewhere but I could not locate it
when I tried and also I worried about it not having GPL license.
So I looked on the web using Google and found this, with GPL header
attached, and tested it for a few values.   It worked OK although I agree
it does not look very clean.

However, if you really want to be astonished look at the version in libc.
That one uses successive approximation to calculate the result!
It guesses some value for the time_t, calls gmtime on that, compares the 6
fields of the resulting struct tm with the passed arg and adjusts the
time_t until they match....  sick.

Something like that could be the easy solution when having to deal with
timezones and DST, but the same method is used for UTC/GMT...

But OK, what is there now looks like a good base for putting UTC times
from the GPS into ntpshm.  I'm going to devise some method of taking the
(presumably) most reliable message available to provide the time,
otherwise there will be quite some jitter.
(look at what happens on the sirfmon display when different messages
provide time and decode_time is called for each of them)
