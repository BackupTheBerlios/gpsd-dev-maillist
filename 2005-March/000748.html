Foo! I apparently don't know how to use scp and can't type either. :P
I just checked and I now have the right version up. Ch 3, p. 81.

Scary, isn't it.

&gt;<i> Doesn't sound like a portable solution.

No, it's not, and it requires more hardware that none of us have.

</I>
The last few times I've mentioned errors in the documentation, I have got
them fixed. I don't know if my contact made the fixes or passed them to the
document control team, but I do have reason to believe that reporting
documentation errors wouldn't be a complete waste of time.

I've been reading that pdf long enough that I can't see the forest for the
trees, so a fresh review might be a good thing.

      GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
