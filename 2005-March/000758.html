<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">ckuethe at ualberta.ca</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Looking at my web logs, I see what appears to be Eric's machine asking for
</I>&gt;<i> the PDF (educated guess at the ISP, and the only linux machine to connect
</I>&gt;<i> at that time) at 0942h and 0947h. The pdf was updated at 0915h. Maybe his
</I>&gt;<i> ISP has some insane transparent webcache that spoofs the requesting box on
</I>&gt;<i> the way out and traps everything on the way in... I've survived worse nets
</I>&gt;<i> than that...
</I>
Those times sound right; I did try to retrieve it twice, about 5 minutes
apart.  The IP address was probably 66.92.53.140.

In other news, attempting to interpret packet 41 is not going well.  Here
are messages from my latest run:

gpsd: GNI payload length 91: 290000000001200ef1a1e600000000000000000000000017dcd1fed2fc7e19000030ff00003e38000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
gpsd: NAV Type: 00
gpsd: Status = 0, mode = 1
gpsd: GPS Week: 288  TOW: 250716646
gpsd: UTC: 1985-08-12T01:26:6.460

The ID and payload length match the docs, but that's the end of the happiness.
Note the obviously wrong GPS week value.  The UTC date isn't from the UTC 
fields but computed from week/TOW value.

Here's the code that is trying to crack this thing -- getb/getw/getl
have the obvious semantics:

	/*
	 * Many versions of the SiRF protocol manual don't document 
	 * this sentence at all.  Those that do may incorrectly
	 * describe UTC Day, Hour, Minute, Second as 2-byte quantities,
	 * not 1-byte. Chris Kuethe, our SiRF expert, tells us:
	 *
	 * The Geodetic Navigation packet (0x29) was not fully
	 * implemented in firmware prior to version 2.3.2. So for
	 * anyone running 231.000.000 or earlier (including ES,
	 * SiRFDRive, XTrac trains) you won't get UTC time. I don't
	 * know what's broken in firmwares before 2.3.1...
	 *
	 * I don't see any indication in any of my material that PDOP,
	 * GDOP or VDOP are output. There are quantities called
	 * Estimated {Horizontal Position, Vertical Position, Time,
	 * Horizonal Velocity} Error, but those are apparently only
	 * valid when SiRFDRive is active.
	 *
	 * (SiRFdrive is their Dead Reckoning augmented firmware. It
	 * allows you to feed odometer ticks, gyro and possibly 
	 * accelerometer inputs to the chip to allow it to continue 
	 * to navigate in the absence of satellite information, and 
	 * to improve fixes when you do have satellites.)

	buf2[0] = '\0';
	for (i = 0; i &lt; len-4; i++)
	    sprintf(buf2+strlen(buf2), &quot;%02x&quot;, buf[i]);
	gpsd_report(1, &quot;GNI payload length %d: %s\n&quot;, len, buf2);
	session-&gt;gNMEAdata.status = STATUS_NO_FIX;
	session-&gt;gNMEAdata.mode = MODE_NO_FIX;
	if (!getw(1)) {		/* check for valid navigation status */
	    st = getw(3);
	    gpsd_report(3, &quot;NAV Type: %02x\n&quot;, st);
	    if (st &amp; 0x80)
		session-&gt;gNMEAdata.status = STATUS_DGPS_FIX;
	    else if (st &amp; 0x06)
		session-&gt;gNMEAdata.status = STATUS_FIX;
	    REFRESH(session-&gt;gNMEAdata.status_stamp);
	    if (st &amp; 0x03)
		session-&gt;gNMEAdata.mode = MODE_3D;
	    else if (st &amp; 0x06)
		session-&gt;gNMEAdata.mode = MODE_2D;
	    REFRESH(session-&gt;gNMEAdata.mode_stamp);
	}
	gpsd_report(1, &quot;Status = %d, mode = %d\n&quot;, session-&gt;gNMEAdata.status, session-&gt;gNMEAdata.mode);
	/* compute UTC from extended GPS time */
	gpsd_report(3, &quot;GPS Week: %d  TOW: %d\n&quot;, getw(5), getl(7));
	fixtime = GPS_EPOCH + (getw(5) * SECS_PER_WEEK) + getl(7)/100.00;
	intfixtime = (int)fixtime;
	when = localtime(&amp;intfixtime);
	session-&gt;year = when-&gt;tm_year;
	session-&gt;month = when-&gt;tm_mon + 1;
	session-&gt;day = when-&gt;tm_mday;
	session-&gt;hours = when-&gt;tm_hour;
	session-&gt;minutes = when-&gt;tm_min;
	session-&gt;seconds = fixtime - (intfixtime / 60) * 60;
	strftime(session-&gt;gNMEAdata.utc, sizeof(session-&gt;gNMEAdata.utc),
		 &quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:&quot;, when);
	sprintf(session-&gt;gNMEAdata.utc+strlen(session-&gt;gNMEAdata.utc),
		&quot;%02.3f&quot;, session-&gt;seconds);
	gpsd_report(1, &quot;UTC: %s\n&quot;, session-&gt;gNMEAdata.utc);

Is there anything obviously wrong with this?  Have I messed up the byte 
offsets somehow?

My firmware version is 231.000.000ES-01-39.  Am I screwed?
