For a while I was thinking it was AFS - user webpages here are served from
AFS, and maybe the cache was stale. I ruled that out by checking the md5 of
the file downloaded from home, downloaded from the office and the local file
on my dev box and they're all the same, so the inconsistent-by-design cache
in afs wasn't at fault.

Looking at my web logs, I see what appears to be Eric's machine asking for
the PDF (educated guess at the ISP, and the only linux machine to connect
at that time) at 0942h and 0947h. The pdf was updated at 0915h. Maybe his
ISP has some insane transparent webcache that spoofs the requesting box on
the way out and traps everything on the way in... I've survived worse nets
than that...

      GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
