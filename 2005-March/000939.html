<PRE>Well I tried all sorts of things to create a NONBLOCK scenario and no luck.
I don't think that is the problem.  

Also I was being conservative with my 10 second count - it's actually more
like 17 seconds.  It shows a no probe match before switching to the next
baud rate.  Could this be because my GPS only pulses information once per
second?

I have a feeling that if I were Aunt Tilley everything would be working fine
:<i>)

Cheers

&gt;<i> Well I tried the O_NONBLOCK option and also added fnctl with FNDELAY to
</I>try
&gt;<i> that as well - still wouldn't work.  Looking at the code I question if
</I>&gt;<i> tcsetattr is being called after setting the flags.  I'm really just a
</I>&gt;<i> weekend coder so I can't immediately tell from the code if this is
</I>&gt;<i> happening.  I'll look a little closer later on.
</I>
Do that.  I'd try it here, but I can't test...
 
&gt;<i> Regarding adding a config file for us power users?  Why not - you could
</I>have
&gt;<i> the program look for the config file from a command switch - if its there
</I>&gt;<i> then act on it - otherwise use the auto-detect parameters. 
</I>
Simpler just to scan the config file if it exists.

&gt;<i>                                                           For my embedded
</I>&gt;<i> application the hunt takes approx. 10 secs to lock in at 9600 baud - which
</I>&gt;<i> is really quite a long time.
</I>
That's such a long time that I don't believe it.  Each baud hunt scans
600 characters.  4800 baud at 8N1 ships 533.3 chars/sec, so failing
should take about 1.1 seconds after which 9600 is the next one tried.
The longest sync time you should *ever* see is less than 2.2 seconds.
Either your UART is doing something ridiculous or there's something
else going on.

&gt;<i> I too agree that building this for Aunt Tilley is a great idea.  But this
</I>is
&gt;<i> linux isn't it - aren't we supposed to be able to tweak things with
</I>options.
&gt;<i> Let's build it for Aunt Tilley and her nephew geek.  If it's not too much
</I>&gt;<i> work.  
</I>
There's still the problem that if we fix a baud rate, sometimes it will be
the wrong one.  I hate it when that happens. :-)
