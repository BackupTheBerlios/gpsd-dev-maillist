<PRE>&gt;<i> ASCII free-text. I've a receiver that says 231.000.000ES, and some that
</I>&gt;<i> say
</I>&gt;<i> 2.3.2-GSW2-2.05.024-C1Prod1.3
</I>
In that case I think the version checking code needs some work...
Maybe something like this:

v = 0;

for (p = ... (where version string is); *p; p++) {
   if (isdigit(*p))
      v = 10 * v + *p - '0';

   if (isalpha(*p))
      break;
}


&gt;&gt;<i> My old uBlox gps-ms1 returns: 1.3.2SCKR344
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a SiRFstar I product.
</I>
Ok...  I did not realize that.  For purposes of this project there does
not seem to be a critical difference between SiRF and SiRF-II.

&gt;&gt;<i> Right now, gpsd considers it &quot;less than 231&quot; and tries to throw it in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NMEA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode, which fails, and then only complains about unexpected NMEA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think sending message 135 (Set protocol) might be useful here. uBlox
</I>&gt;<i> says
</I>&gt;<i> in their 2.x manuals that this message is obsolete. SiRF marketing
</I>&gt;<i> insisted
</I>&gt;<i> on a bunch of backward compatibility features in the pinout and protocol,
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> there's a good chance that this message will do what we hope...
</I>
I have docs that tell me how to put it in NMEA (at home), but I don't want
that to happen.   So, I want to change the version checking, not the &quot;set
to NMEA&quot;.  Why is it that the code puts older versions than 231 in NMEA
mode?
My version probably is 132 and SiRF Binary works OK on it...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> see the pdf below for documentation of the uBlox extensions.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.linkwave.co.uk/assets/GPS.G2-X-01003-E1.pdf">http://www.linkwave.co.uk/assets/GPS.G2-X-01003-E1.pdf</A>
</I>
I have full documentation of the receiver and the protocol.
In fact I wrote the program that was the base for sirfmon.c and Eric
contacted me to get permission to use it.  That is how I got involved in
this project.
Then I wrote ntpshm.c as I use the receiver for clocksync myself and want
to move that functionality into gpsd so I can change from my own quick and
dirty program to gpsd.
The first implementation only uses the messages from the receiver, but on
my own system I use PPS output from the receiver via the DCD line to get
much better synchronization.  However, we need to find out if the typical
GPS-mouse type of receiver provides PPS.

&gt;<i> Very old firmware indeed, running on an old chipset.
</I>
Before it had even older firmware, but I flashed it to this version.
All this happened long ago and the receiver was just happily providing
timesync to my system at home, until Eric's message refreshed my interest.
