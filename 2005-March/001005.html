<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> It is also possible to increase the stratum of the SHM clock with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fudge 127.127.28.0 stratum 8
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but I think I have something better.  The RFC-1305 &quot;dispersion&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> the gps is less than on my home cable modem.  Sometimes a lot less.  The
</I>&gt;<i> problem is the offset of the GPS from &quot;true&quot; time.  I assume this offset
</I>&gt;<i> is in data transfer and processing delays and seems to be consistent
</I>&gt;<i> within a few tens of microseconds.
</I>
Then you are lucky.  There often are variable delays in the message
transfer and processing.  For example, the popular 16550 UART used in COM
ports has a FIFO buffer that transfers serial data to the driver in chunks
of 8 characters, and can cause nondeterministic variations (jitter).
Setting the FIFO threshold to 1 can improve things.

On my PPS reference the jitter is usually 0.002 ms in ntpq -p

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I did this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 0.050 refid GPS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not decided yet whether the 0.050 might be better off as 0.030 or
</I>&gt;<i> something in between.  Since the uncertainty over an hour is on the
</I>&gt;<i> order of 0.040 mS it is probably not important.  Before I make that
</I>&gt;<i> final decision I need to get my laptop well connected to a good, low
</I>&gt;<i> dispersion and low delay, statum 1.  Mostly that involves getting on a
</I>&gt;<i> fast pipe and off my home cable modem.
</I>
Fortunately I have another stratum zero reference on my system so it is a
but easier to compare things...  and find the offset.
Indeed a cable or ADSL connection often has bursts of high RTT and makes
an unstable reference.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My laptop also uses 3 other stratum 2 and 3 servers.  When my cable
</I>&gt;<i> modem is acting well, they outvote the GPS.  When the cable modem is
</I>&gt;<i> acting bad, the GPS wins.  Once again my faith in ntpd is validated.
</I>&gt;<i> Give ntpd enough time sources and it just does the right thing!
</I>
That is certainly true.  However, it is not clear what exact decisions it
makes.  In the first version of ntpshm.c I fixed the precision to -1 which
means 2^-1 = 0.5 seconds of precision.  This does not seem to make it
disregard this clock in the presence of other references.

I have seen other SHM clock reference programs that go into the trouble of
calculating the RMS average of jitter of the last couple of samples and
actually calculate a precision from that.  I still wanted to add that, but
the current results seem to indicate it won't have much effect.  Maybe on
the clockstats output, but not on the peer selection.
