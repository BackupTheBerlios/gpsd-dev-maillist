<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">ckuethe at ualberta.ca</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt;Oh -- you mean I'm getting original GPS weeks rather than extended weeks?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;That I can cope with.  I successfully wrote code to convert those to UTC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;when interpreting message 2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe. Check to see if ($week == ($week % 1024)). My 2.3.1ES build gives me
</I>&gt;<i> short weeks, and my 2.3.2 builds give me extended. The latter is what should
</I>&gt;<i> happen according to the manual: &quot;GPS week number; week 0 started 1980/01/06.
</I>&gt;<i> This value is extended beyond the 10-bit value reported by the SVs.&quot; I guess
</I>&gt;<i> it's fair that 2.3.1 gives back short weeks, because message 41 wasn't fully
</I>&gt;<i> implemented then.
</I>
What I did was write a function that interprets week/TOW as short weeks if
less than 1024, extended weeks if greater.  This seems to work.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;In my issue of 2.3.1ES, most of that packet was zeroed out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Interesting...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Same as your packet. There are a few values in there, but most of them
</I>&gt;<i> are wired to zero: wave the gps around and watch your speed and course
</I>&gt;<i> not change.
</I>
Actually, speed and course do change.  In a suspiciously random way.

&gt;<i> The position is right, I don't trust the velocity.
</I>
Which, as I noted last night, varies randomly and largely.

Can you test SVN head against 232 firmware?  It will be interesting to 
see if it gives better results.
