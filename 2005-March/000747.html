<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">ckuethe at ualberta.ca</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt;What 'protocol reference' are you trying to point me at?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's in this one, I just forgot to upload the latest version. My bad.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/SiRF%20Binary%20Protocol.pdf">http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/SiRF%20Binary%20Protocol.pdf</A>
</I>
Sorry, I still don't see a Geodetic Navigation Data packet there.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;Guess I have to query the version and not go to binary mode unless it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;newer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, that's one way to do it. You could also parse the geodetic navigation
</I>&gt;<i> packet, look for a TimeOfWeek, Latitude and Longitude that are fairly close
</I>&gt;<i> to what's found in message 2 and use the altitude if those match up. You'll
</I>&gt;<i> need to do that because the nav type field will claim &quot;no solution&quot; though
</I>&gt;<i> there is some valid data in the packet. Yuk!
</I>
The thought of such fudging disturbs me.

&gt;<i> &gt;What is SiRFDrive, and do I want to activate it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's their Dead Reckoning augmented firmware. It allows you to feed odometer
</I>&gt;<i> ticks, gyro and possibly accelerometer inputs to the chip to allow it to
</I>&gt;<i> continue to navigate in the absence of satellite information, and to improve
</I>&gt;<i> fixes when you do have satellites.
</I>
Doesn't sound like a portable solution.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;Ghod, their documentation sucks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could think of a few ways to rewrite it, but it's by no means the worst.
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, It's still possible to read it and implement the things it talks of
</I>&gt;<i> without getting a migraine.
</I>
Are you in contact with the person a SiRF who owns the docs?  If I
thought it wouldn't be a wasted effort, I'd generate a detailed
description of what needs to be done to fix them.
