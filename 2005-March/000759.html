As I said, it's not completely implemented before 2.3.2. Looking at one of
your earlier emails where you were getting $somethingthatisntnmea messages,
I see that you are running firmware 231.000.000ES. Same one as I have on my
Pharos iGPS360. Feh!

eek.

the week is right. it is gps week 287. it is extended gps week 1317.
time of week is in milliseconds.

In my issue of 2.3.1ES, most of that packet was zeroed out.

I'll take my trust red pen to your code and get back to you on that.

      GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
