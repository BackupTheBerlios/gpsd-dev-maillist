According to this:

<A HREF="http://pcptpp030.psychologie.uni-regensburg.de/trafficresearch/NMEA0183/">http://pcptpp030.psychologie.uni-regensburg.de/trafficresearch/NMEA0183/</A>

There's a provision in the protocol for &quot;proprietary sentences&quot; - the
talker id for these is the single character &quot;P&quot;, where the remainder
is left undefined.   Perhaps that's a hook? Else, maybe it's ok to fit
something into the &quot;holes&quot; in this list:

<A HREF="http://pcptpp030.psychologie.uni-regensburg.de/trafficresearch/NMEA0183/talkers.txt">http://pcptpp030.psychologie.uni-regensburg.de/trafficresearch/NMEA0183/talkers.txt</A>

&gt;<i> Implementing this would involve adding a talker-ID field to the 'o'
</I>&gt;<i> command, and a command to query the talker ID in the last report
</I>&gt;<i> (perhaps 'J').
</I>
Ok - I'm kind of reluctant to get into this, but (here I go)...

Might another approach be to let clients &quot;subscribe&quot; to one or more
talker's &quot;conversations&quot;?

Example: I have two client programs.  One is interested in GP data.
Another is interested in both LC and GP data.  In either of these
cases (assuming both devices are on the bus), the programs would need
to poll the gpsd server in order to get the data they're interested
in. If a client could instead subscribe to one or more conversations,
they'd be assured of getting only what they want.  The default would
be that you're subscribed to everything, but you could change that.

Then, doesn't it make sense that the talker namespace tag would be
valuable in  all of a,c,d,e,f,i,m,o,p,q,s,t,u,v, and y?  If you had a
&quot;GP&quot; and an &quot;II&quot; on the same bus, you might have a lot of data
competing for storage in a flat namespace.

The reason I'm reluctant here is that if the multiple talkers is on
whole an edge use case, it's a lot of work and change for something
that's not likely to crop up real often (regardless of the
&quot;correctness&quot; of it).
