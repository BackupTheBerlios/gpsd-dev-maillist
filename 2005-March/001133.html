&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://pcptpp030.psychologie.uni-regensburg.de/trafficresearch/NMEA0183/">http://pcptpp030.psychologie.uni-regensburg.de/trafficresearch/NMEA0183/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a provision in the protocol for &quot;proprietary sentences&quot; - the
</I>&gt;<i> talker id for these is the single character &quot;P&quot;, where the remainder
</I>&gt;<i> is left undefined.   Perhaps that's a hook?
</I>
Hmmm, that's clever.  Yes, it would be reasonable to describe SiRF or
Zodiac packets as proprietary sentences in exactly that way.  Or, actually,
to just set a talker ID of GP because a SiRF set is a GPS talker -- 
we're *not* going to get SiRF binary and NMEA packets mixed on a 
multidrop bus.

However, after I wrote you I figured out that this problem is already
solved.  For profiling purposes, the code already stashes a tag for
the last sentence.  In the the NMEA case it's the name of the last
sentence, *with* talker ID prefix.  In the SiRF case it synthesizes a
sentence name as MID%d where %d is the packet type. The Zodiac tag is
just good %d -- in both SiRF and Zodiac cases I tried to follow the
vendor protocol manual's naming convention for the packet.

(Gary, you ought to fix the Garmin driver to fill in the tag field.)

At the moment I pass the tag up only in the $ command used
for profiling, but it would be trivial to make it a field in the
'o' command.  In fact I just made and tested this change, though
I haven't comitted it yet.

&gt;<i> Might another approach be to let clients &quot;subscribe&quot; to one or more
</I>&gt;<i> talker's &quot;conversations&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example: I have two client programs.  One is interested in GP data.
</I>&gt;<i> Another is interested in both LC and GP data.  In either of these
</I>&gt;<i> cases (assuming both devices are on the bus), the programs would need
</I>&gt;<i> to poll the gpsd server in order to get the data they're interested
</I>&gt;<i> in. If a client could instead subscribe to one or more conversations,
</I>&gt;<i> they'd be assured of getting only what they want.  The default would
</I>&gt;<i> be that you're subscribed to everything, but you could change that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, doesn't it make sense that the talker namespace tag would be
</I>&gt;<i> valuable in  all of a,c,d,e,f,i,m,o,p,q,s,t,u,v, and y?  If you had a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;GP&quot; and an &quot;II&quot; on the same bus, you might have a lot of data
</I>&gt;<i> competing for storage in a flat namespace.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I'm reluctant here is that if the multiple talkers is on
</I>&gt;<i> whole an edge use case, it's a lot of work and change for something
</I>&gt;<i> that's not likely to crop up real often (regardless of the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;correctness&quot; of it).
</I>
Right.  On the other hand, it's worth thinking about this because there
may be easy changes (like adding the sentence tag to the 'o' command) that
will keep our options open for later.

It's interesting that you mention this just now.  I've been thinking
about subscriptions in a different context.  Here's a piece of the
current TODO file:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Multi-device support

gpsd has been evolving away from being a simple device monitor towards
being a persistent agent whose job it is to impedance-match between
GPSes and applications (one which may talk to several devices in its
lifetime).  Steps in this evolution have been:

1. Automatic device reconnect, which already almost worked in 1.10.

2. The X command reporting on whether a GPS is available.

3. The B command allowing a client to change the connection baud rate.

4. The F command allowing GPS to switch devices when only the
   switch-requesting client is active.

5. The N command allowing a client to switch from NMEA to binary
   and vice-versa (on chips that support this). 

An issue that came up in my conversation with David Zeuthen is that
HAL would (at least philosophically) like to support *multiple* GPSes.
Whether HAL integration happens or not, this started me thinking about
multi-GPS support in gpsd.

Implementing multi-GPS support would not be a large problem.  One
of my major goals in re-architecting the daemon code was to turn as
much of it as possible into a re-entrant library keeping its data in a
single session structure.  I achieved this so completely that the
entire daemon has only eight global variables, all of them visible
only within gpsd.c.  Of these, only two are potentially per-session.

At the implementation level, then, gpsd is already close to being
multi-GPS-ready. The real problem is at design level.  We need to
figure out what the right visibility and lifetime rules for GPS
sessions should be.

At the moment, a GPS session begins when the first client connects.  The
daemon takes this as a cue to open the current GPS device, which may
have been set by the command-line -f option or an F command (the F
command will usually have been generated by a hotplug script).  When
the last client exits, the GPS device is closed and the session ends.   

There are two rules about F commands:

1. An F command fails if probing the specified device does not
confirm it is a GPS.  gpsd reverts to the previous device.

2. An F command also fails if there is more than one client attached.

3, All client sessions talk to the same device, the one specified by the
   last successful F command.

The effect of the combination of these rules is to prevent
denial-of-service attacks.  They mean that a rogue client cannot
prevent other processes from getting GPS service by pointing
gpsd at a bogus device.  A rogue client cannot even change 
which device another client sees.

Now, suppose we want to support multiple clients talking to multiple
GPSes using just one instance of gpsd?  The reason to want this is
that, ideally, access to all GPSes should go through the same
well-known port.  Also, a multi-device gpsd would be convenient for
supporting multiple GPSes in HAL.

There are two possible ways we could approach this:

*** Channels

In the first approach, each client is at any given time listening to 
a channel attached to a specified device. It does not see messages
from other devices.

Rule 1 would still be good.  But now we want a client to be able to switch
to a new device without affecting other clients, so rules 3 and 2 break.

We can't just use F for device switching, because hotplug scripts
need it in order to tell gpsd when a new device is available for
all clients.  F will need to have the semantics &quot;add a GPS to gpsd's
internal search list (and switch this client to use that GPS)&quot;.  

We'll need to have a new command that removes a GPS from the GPS list
(hotplug scripts will use it to cue gpsd on a remove event).  For the
sake of the discussion, let's name that command K.

The interesting questions are these: 

(1) When a client connects to gpsd, and more than one GPS is hot, 
    which one does it get by default?

(2) What should happen to a client session when its GPS gets unplugged 
    *and other devices are available*?

Tentative answers:

(1) The default GPS is the last one plugged in.
(2) Nothing.  It should just get an offline indication.

The main problem with this approach is that it's complicated.  The 
resulting implementation is likely to be fragile and have unexpected
edge cases.

*** Multicasting

The other approach would be simpler.  No channels: data from all devices is
available to all clients.  When you query, you get the data from the
last device to update (and the name of that last device is available).
When in watcher mode, all messages are tagged with a device ID.

This raises some potential problems, however, especially with NMEA
devices that don't update atomically.  Suppose one device updates 
a 3D fix, then another updates with only a 2D fix?  Currently, the
altitude field of the libgps is never cleared unless the mode
changes. Should it be in this case?

Another issue is with commands that control GPS behavior (currently B
and N; more might be added).  When a client issues them, how do we
know which device to apply them to?

Related issue: a malicious client could issue K commands that would 
affect other clients.  How do we prevent this?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In effect, your proposal about talker subscriptions raises some of the 
same issues that were going to come up in supporting multiple devices.

Your proposal of implementing subscriptions in the daemon itself raises
exactly the same implementation issues as the &quot;Channels&quot; strawman above,
and has the same problem (it would complicated and tricky).

It seems clear to me that the right answer for coping with talker IDs
is the multicast nodel -- the daemon makes everything available to everyone, 
clients do the electing.  

That means I'm looking more seriously at a multicast design for handling
multiple devices, too.
