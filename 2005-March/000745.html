<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">ckuethe at ualberta.ca</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt;Aha!  That looks like exactly what I need.  Can you point me at a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;document that gives the byte-by-byte breakdown on this packet?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/">http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's in the protocol reference up on my site. There are a couple of errors
</I>&gt;<i> in the pdf. I have reported them to SiRF and they have fixed them, but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have their very latest version. Or you could look at Decoder_041.pm
</I>&gt;<i> from my kit, if you don't mind reading the unpack() format string.
</I>
I looked in

<A HREF="http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/SiRF%20Binary%20Protocol.pdf">http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/SiRF%20Binary%20Protocol.pdf</A>
<A HREF="http://www.rayming.com/download/SiRF%20Binary%20Protocol.pdf">http://www.rayming.com/download/SiRF%20Binary%20Protocol.pdf</A>

before I asked you, and it's not in either of those.  What 'protocol
reference' are you trying to point me at?

&gt;<i> The error is that the UTC Day, Hour, Minute, Second are 1-byte quantities,
</I>&gt;<i> not 2-byte.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One problem: this packet was not fully implemented in firmware prior to
</I>&gt;<i> version 2.3.2. So for anyone running 231.000.000 or earlier (including
</I>&gt;<i> ES, SiRFDRive, XTrac trains) you won't get UTC time. I don't know what's
</I>&gt;<i> broken in firmwares before 2.3.1...
</I>
Guess I have to query the version and not go to binary mode unless it's newer.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;Should I take it that I can't get PDOP and VDOP?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that would be a fair statement. I don't see any indication in any
</I>&gt;<i> of my material that PDOP, GDOP or VDOP are output. There are quantities
</I>&gt;<i> called Estimated {Horizontal Position, Vertical Position, Time, Horizonal
</I>&gt;<i> Velocity} Error, but those are apparently only valid when SiRFDRive is
</I>&gt;<i> active.
</I>
What is SiRFDrive, and do I want to activate it?
 
&gt;<i> I need to dig the docs for 27 out of my email; it's not documented anywhere
</I>&gt;<i> save for an email I got from one of the engineers. The rest of it is up on
</I>&gt;<i> my web page: the latest PDF I have and the decoders in my cvs snapshot.
</I>
Ghod, their documentation sucks.
