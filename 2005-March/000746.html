It's in this one, I just forgot to upload the latest version. My bad.

Yeah, that's one way to do it. You could also parse the geodetic navigation
packet, look for a TimeOfWeek, Latitude and Longitude that are fairly close
to what's found in message 2 and use the altitude if those match up. You'll
need to do that because the nav type field will claim &quot;no solution&quot; though
there is some valid data in the packet. Yuk!

Another method for getting UTC involves much more insanity: working with the
50 bps datastream.

&gt;<i> What is SiRFDrive, and do I want to activate it?
</I>
It's their Dead Reckoning augmented firmware. It allows you to feed odometer
ticks, gyro and possibly accelerometer inputs to the chip to allow it to
continue to navigate in the absence of satellite information, and to improve
fixes when you do have satellites.

&gt;<i> Ghod, their documentation sucks.
</I>
I could think of a few ways to rewrite it, but it's by no means the worst.
I mean, It's still possible to read it and implement the things it talks of
without getting a migraine.

You should see what some other vendors have done to that document: multiple
column layout, poorly labelled tables, tables spanning page breaks, removal
of certain key explanations... Anyway, I'd rather have bad docs than no docs.

The RTCM standards aren't much better. Yeah, I did actually pay for those
and I'll put together a crib sheet on decoding RTCM correction messages.
When was the last time you had a read through the ICD-200C? ;)

      GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
