<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">ckuethe at ualberta.ca</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;It's in this one, I just forgot to upload the latest version. My bad.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;<A HREF="http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/SiRF%20Binary%20Protocol.pdf">http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/SiRF%20Binary%20Protocol.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Sorry, I still don't see a Geodetic Navigation Data packet there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Foo! I apparently don't know how to use scp and can't type either. :P
</I>&gt;<i> I just checked and I now have the right version up. Ch 3, p. 81.
</I>
Sorry, I still don't see it.  At that URL, I see only an Appendix A,
still with no description of the Geodetic Navigation Packet.

&gt;<i> &gt;The thought of such fudging disturbs me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Scary, isn't it.
</I>
I was thinking about this, and it may well be that snarfing the time from
the 0x02 message will always work.  Both periodic sentences are triggered
by the fix at the start of the send cycle, so they should reflect the same
fix time.  Do they ever not do so?

&gt;<i> The last few times I've mentioned errors in the documentation, I have got
</I>&gt;<i> them fixed. I don't know if my contact made the fixes or passed them to the
</I>&gt;<i> document control team, but I do have reason to believe that reporting
</I>&gt;<i> documentation errors wouldn't be a complete waste of time.
</I>
Well, as soon as I can see the semi-mythical updated version with type 41
in it :-), I'll write a dissection.
