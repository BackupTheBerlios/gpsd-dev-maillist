Yup.
I put the L command in to open up a new name space. What that allows you is to 
have gpsd support older clients, but new clients are allowed to use advanced 
queries.
Let's say we return L=2. The client now knows that this gpsd can do more nifty 
things.

We could extend the name space by defining a simple query language and 
prepending every query with a period (.).
     .time?
     .date?
     .humidity?

Or the client could set the Level to 2, by sending L=2.
Then the old commands are not parsed for this client, only the new syntax.
No period required.

What I really wanted to do, was to put a tiny basic interpreter or another 
script language in, but I have not thought that through yet. There are a 
number of pitfalls.

Are there any ideas about how the protocol should look like? Obviously, my 
example is not a suggestion, I only wanted to explain the mechanism I had in 
mind to go to another name space.

Cheers,
Remco
