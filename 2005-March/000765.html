murfl. my math is off. it is currently week 288 or extended week 1213.

</I>
Maybe. Check to see if ($week == ($week % 1024)). My 2.3.1ES build gives me
short weeks, and my 2.3.2 builds give me extended. The latter is what should
happen according to the manual: &quot;GPS week number; week 0 started 1980/01/06.
This value is extended beyond the 10-bit value reported by the SVs.&quot; I guess
it's fair that 2.3.1 gives back short weeks, because message 41 wasn't fully
implemented then.

&gt;&gt;<i> In my issue of 2.3.1ES, most of that packet was zeroed out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting...
</I>
Same as your packet. There are a few values in there, but most of them
are wired to zero: wave the gps around and watch your speed and course
not change.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My firmware version is 231.000.000ES-01-39.  Am I screwed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mostly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, you know, that packet disassembly doesn't look bad.  OK, so
</I>&gt;<i> UTC is zero.  But the position/velocity data looks right.  The HDOP
</I>&gt;<i> of 0.0 is the only other part that looks bogus.
</I>
The position is right, I don't trust the velocity. Have a look at the dumps
below. There were 4 sensors sitting right next to eachother in a diamond. All
were stationary, flat, level and should have had no multipath: I was on top
of a building and there wasn't much above 5 degrees. The number next to the
packet type is the unix timestamp.

Sensors 1, 2 and 3 are TN-200 with firmware 2.3.2-GSW2-2.05.024-C1Prod1.3.
Sensor #4 is a Microsoft-branded Pharos iGPS360 with firmware 231.000.000ES.

      GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
