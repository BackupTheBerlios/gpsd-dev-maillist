<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I have a real problem with things probing my serial ports unsupervised.
</I>&gt;<i> My hosts have a large array of things hanging off the /dev/tty's.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To name a few in my office alone:
</I>&gt;<i> 	fax/modems
</I>&gt;<i>         cell phones
</I>&gt;<i> 	PDAs
</I>&gt;<i> 	mice
</I>&gt;<i> 	tablets
</I>&gt;<i> 	printers
</I>&gt;<i> 	Linux consoles
</I>&gt;<i> 	Router consoles
</I>&gt;<i> 	IP Switch consoles
</I>&gt;<i> 	MPEG Encoder consoles
</I>&gt;<i> 	UPS
</I>&gt;<i> 	Alarm Systems
</I>&gt;<i> 	Stepper motors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many of the dumber ones implement single character commands or
</I>&gt;<i> strange autobauding.  No way I want to imagine some device banging
</I>&gt;<i> on these without prior permission.
</I>
I hear you.  No, it's very clear that sending probe strings to random
serial devices is a bad, baaaaad idea.  Fortunately we don't have to
do this, since GPSes send packets that are easy to recognize at
1-second intervals.  gpsd doesn't send probe strings to anything that
it hasn't already seem a well-formed and checksummed packet from.

The other helpful thing is that (under Linux, at least) we can check
to see what devices are already opened by another process and ignore them.
So, device scanning would see only devices that are live but not opened
by any other program, and only *read* those.  Does that seem safe enough?

There are other filters we could apply.  On USB devices, we can ignore
any port that doesn't have a class of 0xff (vendor private).

&gt;<i> There is also the very real case where I might have more than one
</I>&gt;<i> GPS hooked up at the same time.  Maybe I am transfering waypoints,
</I>&gt;<i> uploading maps, etc.
</I>
That's a good point.  So you need to be able to select a device, not
just have the first GPS discovered.
 
&gt;<i> gpsd should open /dev/gps by default, then implement one or all of:
</I>&gt;<i> 	1. input tty on the command line
</I>&gt;<i> 	2. prompt for the tty
</I>&gt;<i> 	3. read a config file.
</I>
Naahhh.  Thinking about your requirements, I just had a brainstorm,
We've already got one perfectly good control channel, why not use it?
There's a much simpler way.  An F command accepted on port 2947.

The F command says: go probe this (specified) device file.  If it's a
GPS, store that path for future use.  The way we keep this from being
a DoS tool is: F only works if gpsd *does not have a device currently
open*.  The -p command-line option is equivalent to an initial F command.

You get to open post 2947 and pick your device by hand -- heck, use
netcat if you want.  For autoconfiguration, a hotplug script can send
an F command to port 2947 whenever a USB device of the proper class
wakes up.  The best part is, the hotplug script doesn't even have to
look at gpsd's response!

Beautiful, ain't it?
