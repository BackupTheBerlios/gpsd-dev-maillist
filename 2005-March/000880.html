<PRE>(I sent a similar comment some times ago, but it seems to have been lost: I used gmane.org (e-mail list as newsgroups) and my pan setup was outdated.. I apologize if you saw my answer twice.)

Here are my two cents. Please take this with a grain of salt, as this comes from someone who is using the gpsd command 'r' exclusively.

My major problem with the gpsd protocol is that I have to actually send a query for every item I am interested in, everytime I want an update.

In my context (real-time GUI application with user interaction) this is more complicated than just listening to the NMEA protocol. Using the gpsd client library seems even worst: I understand from the documentation it blocks until the response is available.

(to be honnest, this approach did bring me into hot waters when the app was not able to process the information in less than a second, but I believe I got this one fixed--so maybe using the NMEA mode was not so simple after all :-)

On networks with low bandwidth or long roundtrip (satellite), the sequence of questions and answers is quite inefficient. You might wonder why it matters? Well, as a professional bias I think about bus fleets (these buses real people go into.. :-) linked to control centers through radio networks. More and more, mass transit request this to be a TCP/IP network.

I propose to use a subscription-based model: the client subscribes to each information item it is interested to, which information gpsd will send periodically thereafter.

In addition I would plan for a UDP variant of the protocol. This would make it possible to use broadcast or multicast, another bandwidth saver. There is no need for reliable delivery, since the information is repeated periodically anyway..

At the very least I would like compound requests: asking for multiple information items in a single command.

Thanks.
