<A HREF="http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/">http://www.ualberta.ca/~ckuethe/gps/</A>

It's in the protocol reference up on my site. There are a couple of errors
in the pdf. I have reported them to SiRF and they have fixed them, but I
don't have their very latest version. Or you could look at Decoder_041.pm
from my kit, if you don't mind reading the unpack() format string.

The error is that the UTC Day, Hour, Minute, Second are 1-byte quantities,
not 2-byte.

One problem: this packet was not fully implemented in firmware prior to
version 2.3.2. So for anyone running 231.000.000 or earlier (including
ES, SiRFDRive, XTrac trains) you won't get UTC time. I don't know what's
broken in firmwares before 2.3.1...

&gt;<i> I also note that the HDOP field has an 'm' on it.  Does that mean
</I>&gt;<i> it's not actually HDOP but rather expected error in meters?
</I>
errr. my bad. I put that there when it doesn't belong. That's fixed in
the latest CVS snapshot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Where are HDOP and VDOP?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HDOP is in message 2 and message 41
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should I take it that I can't get PDOP and VDOP?
</I>
I think that would be a fair statement. I don't see any indication in any
of my material that PDOP, GDOP or VDOP are output. There are quantities
called Estimated {Horizontal Position, Vertical Position, Time, Horizonal
Velocity} Error, but those are apparently only valid when SiRFDRive is
active.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. There are three SiRF packet types being shipped once per second
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  that I can't find any documentation for: 0x1b, 0x29, and 0x32.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Do you know how to decode these?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0x1b = 27 = DGPS Status
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0x29 = 41 = Geodetic Navigation Data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0x32 = 50 = SBAS Corrections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do indeed have documentation and decoders for these. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well...web pointer?  Please?
</I>
I need to dig the docs for 27 out of my email; it's not documented anywhere
save for an email I got from one of the engineers. The rest of it is up on
my web page: the latest PDF I have and the decoders in my cvs snapshot.

I will confess to taking a horrible shortcut in message 27. Because I made
the assumption that the only DGPS data I would be processing is SBAS messages,
I didn't put in any logic to process dgps messages coming in on serial. I
hate writing code I can't test.

Really, I don't work for SiRF (though that could be fun) and I didn't
h4x0r the gibson...

        GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
