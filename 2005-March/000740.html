<PRE>SVN head now includes a working driver for SiRF binary -- the packet
engine will invoke it automatically when SiRF binary packets present
themselves on the wire acter device open.  Here is what the header
comment observes:

/*
 * This is the gpsd driver for SiRF-II GPSes operating in binary mode.
 *
 * The advantage: Reports climb/sink rate (raw-mode clients won't see this).
 *
 * The disadvantages: Doesn't return HDOP or VDOP, just PDOP.  Reports 
 * altititude relative to the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid, not MSL.
 *
 * Rumor has it we should be able to get UERE data out of this, but I
 * have not figured out how to yet.  The SiRF documentation sucks horribly!
 */

1. Where in the binary output is the geodetic separation?  

2. Where are HDOP and VDOP?

3. There are three SiRF packet types being shipped once per second
   that I can't find any documentation for: 0x1b, 0x29, and 0x32.
   Do you know how to decode these?

Americans have the right and advantage of being armed - unlike the citizens
of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
