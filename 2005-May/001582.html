I can understand what you mean.  I have found some bugs that made me
wonder a little...   like the memory fault in ntpshm that turned out to be
caused by an interface change that was not applied to all calls of the
function.

Maybe it is time to cross-check a lot of things.  IMHO it would be safest
when all possible effects are considered whenever a change is made.  It
should not be too difficult to grep for any reference to something
whenever a change to its interface or the units of measurement is made.

To make some tests a bit easier, I would like to propose a &quot;really raw&quot; mode.
(command R=2 for example)
This would relay the raw data from the receiver over the TCP session, even
when it is not NMEA.
With a small change to sirfmon we could run it in parallel with gpsd and
observe somewhat easier what is being done with the data.
