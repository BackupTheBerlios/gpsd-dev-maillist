<PRE>Message ID 41 (0x29) was in fact not fully filled out until version
2.3.2 -- it was only available for development of our SiRFDRive DR
product in 2.3.1.  As to time, at the time of 2.3.1 leap seconds were
still 13 where they have been for some few years now.  I don't
understand how the time is off by two or three seconds.  We specify
where we output UTC and where we output GPS time, and in most cases
where the format is seconds in the current week that is specified as GPS
time.  In fact, I cannot think of any place where we output time of week
that is not GPS time.  Similarly, if we output hours/minutes/seconds it
is UTC time, and our default leap-second adjustment is 13 seconds, so it
should be right.

One issue for discussion is that we do not output on the second (unless
you are using message ID 52).  We make measurements in the receiver in
time with an internal counter that is not slaved to GPS time, so the
measurements are made at a time that wanders around the second.  Then,
after the measurements are made (all normalized to the same point in
time) we dispatch the navigation software to make a solution, and that
solution comes out some 200 to 300 ms after the measurement time.  So
you may get a message at 700 ms after the second that uses measurements
time tagged 450 ms after the second.  And if some other task jumps up
and delays things, that message may not come out until 900 ms after the
second.  Things can get out of sync to the point that if you try to
resolve the GPS time of our 1 PPS pulses using the navigation messages,
you will find it impossible to be consistent.  That is why I added
message ID 52 to our system -- it is tied to the creation of the 1 PPS
and always comes out right around the top of the second.

Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> It looks like your receiver is not outputting either GPS time or UTC
</I>time...
&gt;<i> The message 0x29 time, which is supposed to be UTC, is all zeroes on 
</I>&gt;<i> your receiver.  This is consistent with the comments in the code that 
</I>&gt;<i> say that this does not work before version 232 (and yours is 231).
</I>&gt;<i> So, the program uses messages 0x02 and 0x04.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The time fields there are supposed to be GPS time.  sirfmon prints 
</I>&gt;<i> them unmodified.  You report that they are &quot;a second or two ahead of 
</I>&gt;<i> UTC&quot; but they should have been 13 seconds ahead.
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd subtracts the leap_seconds from that, which should be 13.  That 
</I>&gt;<i> is how you get your &quot;10 seconds behind UTC&quot; time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sort of looks like this particular receiver attempts some GPS-&gt;UTC 
</I>&gt;<i> correction of its own, by subtracting a fixed 10 or 11 seconds (that 
</I>&gt;<i> may have been valid at the time it was built).
</I>&gt;<i> We will have to find some way to turn that off, or to identify the 
</I>&gt;<i> actual offset and an indication that it is being applied.
</I>
Carl, is this at all possible for a SiRF chip at firmware level 231?
