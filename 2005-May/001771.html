 Alright guys, the bug is most definitely at or near the GPGSV parsing 
routine.  The trick to pulling this bug off, is that you need to have a 
partial lock with some satellites in view to start receiving the GPGSV 
sentences.  Just to make sure it wasn't just a problem with the system 
installed on the laptop, I installed ubuntu linux on a test box I had lying 
around.  I then used an usb extension cable to put the gps partially outside.  
Next I installed gpsd-2.24 and followed the same method used on the laptop 
machine which produced the bug originally.
Needless to say, after letting the gps lock and after only a few sessions 
through telnet to the remote box it happened again.  The log of this session 
is attached as gpsdlog.gz.  You might also be able to do this with a log 
being fed into the daemon from gpsfake.

 Basically, anytime you exit the client session to the server when the
daemon is parsing in or near the end of the GPGSV routine, the device
name is overwritten.

 The test box is an athlon 1500 using an ohci host controller with the 
2.6.11.10 kernel and cypress_m8 driver (gcc 3.3.4).  The laptop is an p3 
mobile running gentoo linux (gcc 3.4.3) with an ohci host controller.

 I'm dead certain the problem is at or near the GPGSV routine as at first I 
couldn't reproduce the bug without moving the gps to receive a better signal.

 Eric, information on accessing the test machine is also attached to this 
message using your public key.
