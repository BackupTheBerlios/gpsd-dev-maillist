<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I think a scan should be made along all the possible error fields and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other uncertainty info and make sure that for each protocol the data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ends
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up in the right place.  There are no fields for some of the dop values
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are just discarded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're getting at here.  What &quot;right
</I>&gt;<i> place&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> at what level, and which DOP fields are missing where?
</I>
We don't have fields for TDOP and GDOP.  The sirf code to store them is
commented out, and the dop calculation in gpsutils.c simply omits them.

We have several ep* variables for estimated errors as well.
Some of this data is part of the fix, others are in gps_data.

It needs to be analyzed to see what we need, and where we should put it.
I think they are partly just different ways to express the same thing, but
it may not be practical to convert between them so we should just store
what the receiver provides.  But now, not everything is stored.

&gt;&gt;<i> More of this data should be displayed in xgps (maybe after clicking some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;advanced...&quot; button).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean uncertainty fields?  I agree.
</I>
Yes.


&gt;&gt;<i>                        I also thought about a version of sirfmon that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can attach to the daemon.  This could take the form of a &quot;really raw&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (R=2) that passes on everything received from the serial link,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> untranslated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we could do completely untranslated.  It would have to be
</I>&gt;<i> hex-encoded, at least -- otherwise Bad Things would happen when data
</I>&gt;<i> characters happened to include \n.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         And also allows a &quot;raw command&quot; to be sent.  Then we would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not need to stop the daemon to do closer study and control of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receiver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've thought about this particular feature before, not in the context
</I>&gt;<i> of a super-sirfmon but on its own.  It's not a good idea.  The security
</I>&gt;<i> implications alone would be a showstopper.
</I>
Well, maybe it is not possible to provide it on the TCP interface
(although I do not understand why a certain command, like R=2, could not
switch the data received on the serial link directly to the connection... 
maybe it breaks the basic rules of the protocol, and the way to end this
mode would need to be a disconnect, but TCP is transparent).

The idea is just to have some way to connect sirfmon to the receiver just
as if we could open a serial port multiple times and read the same data in
all processes.  This is normally not possible, and that is part of the
reason for having gpsd.  However, gpsd provides other services as well and
this makes the interface unsuitable for sirfmon, which needs raw data.  So
gpsd should provide some other interface, maybe only available to root
and/or to those local users that could open the COM port directly, to
allow raw access to the serial data.  This could be via the control
socket.
