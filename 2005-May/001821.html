<PRE>&gt;<i> Adding a field for TDOP would be worth considering if any GPS actually
</I>&gt;<i> reported it.
</I>
Both my receivers (uBlox SiRF with special 0x62 message and Zodiac) report
it.


&gt;<i> You need to be careful distinguishing the read side from the write side
</I>&gt;<i> here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The read part (R=2, a really-raw mode) would be easy.  I could
</I>&gt;<i> implement it in about ten lines of code, and it raises no real design
</I>&gt;<i> issues at all.  Whether we do it your way (irreversible escape to raw
</I>&gt;<i> mode) or my way (hex encoding) is a detail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The write side is a whole 'nother kettle of fish.  We've already
</I>&gt;<i> discussed the reasons that allowing any client to send arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> control strings is a bad idea.  That capability would have to be
</I>&gt;<i> confined to an application that uses the control channel.
</I>&gt;<i> But that means sirfmon always has to be root privileged, and
</I>&gt;<i> must talk to a channel other than the normal client socket.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given those two constraints, I don't see a lot of point in
</I>&gt;<i> tying sirfmon to the damon in any way at all.
</I>
Sirfmon can do useful things without write access.
It would also possible to implement only the read access into gpsd, and
have sirfmon open the port itself to do writes.  With serial devices,
multiple writers (especially in this case where there rarely is a write)
are no problem.  Multiple readers are.

I currently have a problem with my receiver that I have been discussing
with Carl.  It would have been convenient to be able to run sirfmon
without having to stop gpsd all the time.  Now I sometimes miss things
because it requires time to switch between xgps+gpsd and sirfmon, and both
have their own qualities while debugging this problem.
