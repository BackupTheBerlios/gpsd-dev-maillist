  I'm not a huge fan of tremendous amounts of &quot;baggage&quot; on a project
that is, at it's core, a &quot;fun&quot; project (as opposed to something lives
depend on).  At the same time, I wonder if the addition of a very
small amount of structure in the form of automated tests might be in
order.  This could be very very simple, for example:

  1.  A &quot;known bugs&quot; file, where each bug gets a number (ie, #1, #2,
      #3).  A sentence or two describes the bug.

  2.  For each bug, a comment in the code noting that &quot;Fixed Bug #42
      here 'cause I was accidentally casting a char to a pointer to an
      integer array&quot;.

  3.  Create a series of tests (perhaps run by 'make test') that tests
      each new bug as it's fixed (ie, link the the appropriate library,
      make the API call, and check the return value).  Maybe even some
      raw NMEA/Sirf/Garmin data to feed to 'gpsfake', then test the
      output.

  I don't want to suggest we take the fun out of gpsd, but this seems
pretty low-overhead.
