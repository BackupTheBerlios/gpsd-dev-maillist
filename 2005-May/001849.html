<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would it be possible to be a little more patient and allow people to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in reports and/or to find problems?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What good would patience do?  That is, what do you believe we would
</I>&gt;<i> accomplish by slowing the release tempo?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you believe that this would somehow increase the amount or quality of
</I>&gt;<i> bug reports and fixes we get?  If so, why do you believe that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My experience is that when small bugs are found at a high rate, the
density is high.  I.e. there is no reason to believe that after fixing 5
small bugs in a week, the program is reasonably bugfree.  It is more of an
indication that still many small bugs exist.

Another experience is that you can often find bugs (especially of the type
that we have seen recently) faster by carefully reading the source and
asking yourself &quot;is it correct what is written here&quot; than by externally
observing the behaviour of the blackbox.
This is what makes open source so strong: others can find and fix bugs
much easier.  But it also means one sometimes has to sitdown and take
time, which is sometimes made difficult when there are &quot;final calls for
fixes&quot; so often.

Furthermore, it is dangerous to assume that fixes are forthcoming as a
result of doing quick releases.  For example, after the previous release
you wrote that as a result of the release a lot of fixes came in, while in
reality my fixes were really sent to be included in that release but
apparently came after you finalized it.  This is partly the result of the
timezone difference.

&gt;&gt;<i> I doubt that the audience is looking for a new version to install.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you want to have an easily accessed version for people to try the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> newest fixes, I think it is better to put a &quot;nightly build&quot; up for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> download.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we could tell people to pull svn head for the latest version.  But
</I>&gt;<i> since I don't presently anticipate any benefit from slowing down the
</I>&gt;<i> release tempo, I don't see why we should make testers jump through that
</I>&gt;<i> extra hoop.  Perhaps you will change my mind, though.
</I>
I can understand not everyone wants to use svn.  It took me some study as
well before I understood how to setup my system so I could work on my own
copy of the code, retrieve recent svn versions, and submit patches that
would not backout other people's changes.

That is why I mention the &quot;nighly build&quot;, by which I mean a set of files
like an official version, but built from the latest svn version.  This
allows users to download recent sources and/or binaries without having to
use svn or even to compile.


&gt;&gt;<i> - validate that all received values are correctly scaled to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> units.  I have been busy with this but then someone else still found an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error (NMEA speed)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that one is pretty well knocked on the head at this point.  There
</I>&gt;<i> aren't that many values that get scaled, and we've walked through them
</I>&gt;<i> all.
</I>
I went through the Zodiac driver and found many errors.  But maybe that
was not indicative as it seemed to be orphaned.


&gt;&gt;<i> - check that &quot;xxx_NOT_VALID&quot; values are outside the normal range for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  grepping....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> gps.h:48:#define TIME_NOT_VALID	0
</I>&gt;<i> gps.h:55:#define UNCERTAINTY_NOT_VALID	-1
</I>&gt;<i> gps.h:57:#define LATITUDE_NOT_VALID	-1
</I>&gt;<i> gps.h:59:#define LONGITUDE_NOT_VALID	-1
</I>&gt;<i> gps.h:62:#define ALTITUDE_NOT_VALID	-999
</I>&gt;<i> gps.h:65:#define TRACK_NOT_VALID	-1	/* No course data yet */
</I>&gt;<i> gps.h:68:#define SPEED_NOT_VALID	-1	/* No speed data yet */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There, that wasn't very hard, was it?  About the only subtle bit is
</I>&gt;<i> noticing
</I>&gt;<i> that it's OK to use 0 as a time value  because GPSes didn't exist in 1969.
</I>
I put up this point when I noticed that -1 is used for invalid latitude
and longitude, yet -1 is a valid value for those.
Maybe they are the only ones but I did not check yet.  From the above list
the others seem OK.


&gt;&gt;<i>       check if we could use magic values like &quot;nan&quot; instead of arbitrary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constant values
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I like that idea, but I have some portability reservations.  Do
</I>&gt;<i> POSIX or X3J11 describe #defines for max or min values?
</I>
It needs investigation.  When it would be simple, I would have sent a patch.
I noticed that printf with the %f format can print &quot;nan&quot; when a value is
not a number.  What I don't know is if  scanf can scan the &quot;nan&quot; string
and set the variable to not-a-number, and if #defines for this value
exist.
If all of these should be true or can be worked around, I would propose to
use &quot;nan&quot; values for undefined values.


&gt;&gt;<i> I think we either need to modify the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packet_sniff code so that it becomes part of the main loop, or we change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to multithreading and start a separate thread  for every receiver while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the main loop concentrates on handling the clients.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hm.  This is a significant problem with the multi-session
</I>&gt;<i> architecture.  I wish you had prought it to my attention sooner.
</I>
It only came to my attention during my work on the Trimble and plugging 3
receivers between 2 ports.

&gt;<i> I lean towards the former.  Threading makes me uncomfortable.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> mind the
</I>&gt;<i> use of it we've made so far because it's for features that are, basically,
</I>&gt;<i> optional.  I don't want to make it part of the normal organization of
</I>&gt;<i> control
</I>&gt;<i> if we can help it.
</I>
Ok, fine with me...   of course it requires a much wider change to bring
the sniff into the mainloop than to separate the receiver drivers into
separate threads, but on the other hand it could be less risky because
there is no locking of data in the current implementation and it could be
required when separate threads start to read and write into the same
datastructure.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have also noticed today that while the system is heavily loaded the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> program can be forced into such an error situation where it ends up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packet_sniff all the time and not recovering.  Because the usleep in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packet_sniff is very small, the CPU usage is high, and the heavy loading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem is worsened.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think increasing the usleep() would be an acceptable fix.
</I>
Yes, my feeling from the beginning was that the variable usleep was a bit
over-engineered and could simply have been a fixed usleep for 20 or 30 ms.
As long as it is above 10ms it will allow other tasks to be scheduled even
when those are of lower priority.
However, when this code is changed to be in the main select loop the
FIONREAD ioctl can simply be dropped and the select will handle the
timeout.

What remains is &quot;why is it failing under high load&quot;?
I have not found that yet.   I was simply copying a lot of disk data
(which causes some buffermanagement trouble especially with Reiserfs, and
thus causes swapping) and suddenly gpsd started using much more CPU, and I
saw that only the PPS threads were still functioning normally but the
packet handler was stuck hunting for valid packets.  No idea yet why it
got an error and why it would not recover.

&gt;&gt;<i> At the moment I am working on a driver for my Trimble receiver.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handles a few received packets, but I need to decode more and also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the sending of control packets (to enable sending of other messages).  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will require a day or two to finish it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  Is this a reason not to release?  Doesn't seem so to me.  Releases
</I>&gt;<i> aren't expensive.
</I>
Not so much for the developer, but we must also think about the user.
When releases are once or twice per week, those who want to make actual
use of the product tend to get a little overwhelmed and do not track them
anymore.
