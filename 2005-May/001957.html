<PRE>&gt;<i> Probably, but since this is my first day of using splint I have not
</I>&gt;<i> learned it yet.  There is an option called +charint that tells
</I>&gt;<i> splint to tread characters as integral types.
</I>
I think it is insane to pickup a new tool like this, and without having
even a day of experience start editing like mad to make all code in an
existing project comply with its taste, one day before release of a new
version.

There will be new bugs because of this (see my previous message, for
example) that will not be evident in casual testing.  A release will go
out that immediately fails for some people.

This is not going to improve the product quality on the short term.
I think you should not focus on bringing the count of warnings down, but
instead read through them and see what problems its warnings are based on
and decide how they should be fixed.

Pedantic warnings about (int)0 not being equal to (unsigned char)0, which
are even false because C defines they are equal, should not lead you into
making edits that are later regretted because they conceal implicit casts
that are really harmful.

Issues like replacing !value with value==0 are just personal tastes of the
writer of the tool.  They are defined to be the same, and you choose which
one to use based on the situation.  The first is normally used in
true/false checking situations, and the second is used when you are
looking for a numeric value of zero.
Blindly replacing something like !have_fix with have_fix==0 is not
improving quality, rather worsening it (because readability improves
understanding of the code by future maintainers and would hopefully
prevent some mistakes when changes are made).
