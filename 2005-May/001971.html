I wrote, compiled and disassembled a small testprogram.
(too lazy to find my way in the maze of twisty little passages that claims
it is the source of the C library)

The x*x case compiles to just an inline fmul.
The pow(x,2) case calls a function (via the usual shared lib overhead)
that does lots of condition checks and calls another function
(ieee754_pow) that again has many conditional jumps.  Probably the
implementation of the smartness you claim it has.

My guess is that on a typical P4-class CPU, on wich execution speed
depends more on the execution path than on the actually executed
instructions, the multiply will be orders of magnitude faster.

When we would want to help embedded systems without floating point
processor, we probably could make a lot of difference by removing all
floating point and replacing it with fixed point (scaled) integer
arithmetic.  Or by going back to float instead of double.


The point was that splint outputs a warning for statements like:

z = sqrt(pow(x,2) + pow(y,2));

... warning that the order of evaluation is undefined and so it isn't
defined in which order the pow() calls are made.  Of course this is true,
but it is almost completely pointless.
It would only be relevant when the function has side-effects that could
depend on the order of calls.  But the only side-effect of pow() is that
it can set errno, and it only does so when a negative number is raised to
a non-integral exponent.  The exponent is constant and integral, so this
cannot happen.  Apparently splint cannot see that.

To make the warning go away, magic comments need to be inserted.  But
alternatively, we could write:

z = sqrt(x*x + y*y);

and make splint shut up.  As Andreas suggested, we could also use
something like:

#define square(x)      ((x)*(x))

in that case someone worried about the performance and not about splint
could change it to:

#define square(x)
