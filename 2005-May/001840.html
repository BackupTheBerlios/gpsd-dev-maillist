Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> PPS support in the code is good, but in the receivers it seems to be
</I>poor.
&gt;<i> I have yet to see a first report of someone using it.  I have two 
</I>&gt;<i> receivers that work, but does someone else?
</I>
Not me.  All my test units are USB.  Alas, when Carl says PPS seems to
be an RS323-only feature, I believe him.

Carl: PPS is a GPIO issue -- if the GPIO is available it can be active
in the right software (i.e., XTrac software does not support 1 PPS, and
cannot other than by &quot;faking&quot; it).  The USB interfaces, and Bluetooth,
etc., don't usually provide a means for getting to that GPIO.  However,
if a particular board does provide access, the message ID 52 or ZDA is
equally supported in USB and RS-232.

&gt;<i> After reading docs and also Carl's mail, I believe that the FIFO is 
</I>&gt;<i> only a very small part of the problem.  At 4800 baud it could be 
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for maybe 15ms of jitter.  That is less than what I 
</I>&gt;<i> typically see at 19200 baud, and much less than the &quot;wander&quot; that I
</I>observe routinely.

OK, I'll remove that from the TO-DO list and add this discussion to the
hacker's guide.

&gt;<i> It would be advisable to make sure that message 52 (PPS time) is 
</I>&gt;<i> enabled when possible.  I have not yet researched how that would be 
</I>&gt;<i> done, but I have added support for handling this message should it be
</I>arriving.

Carl: does MID 52 need to be explicitly enabled?  If so, how is it done?

MID 52 or ZDA is enabled by default in software supporting the 1 PPS.
If it has been turned off by a specific vendor, use message ID 166 to
enable MID 52, message PSRF103 to enable ZDA.  Here is a sample to
enable MID 52:  A0 A2 00 08 A6 00 34 01 00 00 00 00 00 DB B0 B3.

&gt;<i> What happens now is that the segment is made available for use when 
</I>&gt;<i> this or another receiver comes back.
</I>
Yes, I looked at the code and saw that.  I agree with you that trying to
be more clever about it would probably just get us into trouble.

&gt;<i> I think a scan should be made along all the possible error fields and 
</I>&gt;<i> other uncertainty info and make sure that for each protocol the data 
</I>&gt;<i> ends up in the right place.  There are no fields for some of the dop 
</I>&gt;<i> values and they are just discarded.
</I>
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're getting at here.  What &quot;right
place&quot;
at what level, and which DOP fields are missing where?

&gt;<i> More of this data should be displayed in xgps (maybe after clicking 
</I>&gt;<i> some &quot;advanced...&quot; button).
</I>
You mean uncertainty fields?  I agree.
 
&gt;<i> I would like xgps (or another program) to be more like sirf(mon) in 
</I>&gt;<i> that it be a dashboard where as much as possible of the operation of 
</I>&gt;<i> the receiver can be overseen.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i>                        I also thought about a version of sirfmon that 
</I>&gt;<i> can attach to the daemon.  This could take the form of a &quot;really raw&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> mode
</I>&gt;<i> (R=2) that passes on everything received from the serial link, 
</I>&gt;<i> untranslated.
</I>
I don't think we could do completely untranslated.  It would have to be
hex-encoded, at least -- otherwise Bad Things would happen when data
characters happened to include \n.

&gt;<i>         And also allows a &quot;raw command&quot; to be sent.  Then we would not
</I>
&gt;<i> need to stop the daemon to do closer study and control of the 
</I>&gt;<i> receiver.
</I>
I've thought about this particular feature before, not in the context of
a super-sirfmon but on its own.  It's not a good idea.  The security
implications alone would be a showstopper.  If we don't restrict sending
arbitrary data to the GPS to the control channel, DoS attacks against
applications using the GPS would be far too easy,  This might be a good
subject for a note in the Hacker's Guide.
