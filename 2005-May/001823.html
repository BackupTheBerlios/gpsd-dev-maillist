<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Adding a field for TDOP would be worth considering if any GPS actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reported it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both my receivers (uBlox SiRF with special 0x62 message and Zodiac) report
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
Fine, then feel free to send me a patch that adds it to the gpsdata 
structure and fills those fields in the SiRF and Zodiac drivers.

Actually, maybe it's time you got commit privileges.  Bug fixes and this 
sort of thing you should be able to do on your own, though it
would be best to go through me on architectural things.  Do you have
a berlios.de account?

The more serious issue here is how to report TDOP.  I'm tempted just to add a
fourth field to the Q command.  The obvious scanf would still work, so this
would probably not even break backward compatibility.
 
&gt;<i> Sirfmon can do useful things without write access.
</I>
True.

&gt;<i> It would also possible to implement only the read access into gpsd, and
</I>&gt;<i> have sirfmon open the port itself to do writes.  With serial devices,
</I>&gt;<i> multiple writers (especially in this case where there rarely is a write)
</I>&gt;<i> are no problem.  Multiple readers are.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I currently have a problem with my receiver that I have been discussing
</I>&gt;<i> with Carl.  It would have been convenient to be able to run sirfmon
</I>&gt;<i> without having to stop gpsd all the time.  Now I sometimes miss things
</I>&gt;<i> because it requires time to switch between xgps+gpsd and sirfmon, and both
</I>&gt;<i> have their own qualities while debugging this problem.
</I>
It also occurs to me that we don't have to choose.  We could hack
sirfmon so that it tries the daemon first, and falls back to directly
opening the device if no daemon is running.

This is beginning to sound like a plan...
