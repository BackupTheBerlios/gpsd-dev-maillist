<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One thing I noticed is when the state machine finds an error and goes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to GROUND_STATE, the caller only removes 1 character instead of all data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that lead to the error condition.   This could result in a loop under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conditions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What conditions are those?
</I>
Well, the problem I had with zodiac was that it would not get in sync
easily because the FF byte that triggers recognition of this data type can
also easily occur in the packet itself.
Later I found that part of the reason was that at the end of the packet
the state machine remained in ZODIAC_RECOGNIZED state and from there it
would not handle an immediately following packet, so it always alternated
between recognizing packet and skipping the next one via error handling,
requiring to sync up again.
I fixed that, but by then I already had made the header recognition more
robust (only accepting headers with valid checksum as base for reading
data).

I can understand the motivation behind having a sliding window wherein
packets are recognized even after an initial error in sync, but understand
that this also means that a packet with checksum error will be completely
scanned for possible packet beginnings, which is (was) a little risky with
Zodiac packets because they contain a &quot;length&quot; field for the remaining
data.
That means that a misrecognized packet header could lead to read-ahead of
a lot of data.
