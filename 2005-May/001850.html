<PRE>purly subjective comment (IMO):

don't release too frequently: it pushes on users who like to be
recent-stable but not bleeding-edge, rather propose nightly builds or
prereleases/rc's (2.26pre1) - i'd go for prereleases once a week, that
way you'll probably get a new release out every 2-3weeks - and you're
not bound so you can always release when you feel it's time. even though
i'm using SVN i lately had the impression of gpsd rushing it's releases
so maybe it'd be good thing to stay on a release.. as far as incoming
patches are concerned i'd say that the fast paced release strategy makes
lazy users wait before writing a patch they'll think &quot;maybe someone else
is fixing it for next release&quot;

don't release too slowly (i'm not fearing that one with gpsd) - it makes
a user wonder if the project's still alive.

time (and bugreports) will show what needs to be fixed and what can be
improved.

..anyway release policy is not _that_ crucial.. gpsd survived until now
