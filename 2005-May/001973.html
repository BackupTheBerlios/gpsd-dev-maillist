So you think the glibc people put in all thos optimizations to make it
slower? :-)

I agree with you when talking about integer and branch code.  FPU code is
a very different beast.  A P4 class CPU may executre more than
one non-FPU instruction per clock, It may still take hundreds of clocks
to perform heavy FPU ops like fdiv.

Let them help themselves.  These sorts of optimizations are very system
specific.  It is very common for embedded folks to invent their own
float format to give them just the balance of speed/accuracty they need.
The only thing we could do -- and they have not asked -- is to use
arbitrary types for the variables.  Then someone without an FPU could
change the #define from double to whatever works best for him.

No argument here.

&gt;<i> in that case someone worried about the performance and not about splint

I would argue instead not to use a tool that imposes such silly contraints
on the code.
