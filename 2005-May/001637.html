I had such a problem with the zodiac driver.
Once it had encountered a packet with bad header checksum it would not
recover.
It would read more and more data from the serial port, but the packet it
was handling was the same every time, and the error as well.  This looks
like what you are describing.

After some changes and a temporary fix I found that the packet_get code
deletes the wrong character when the state machine detects an incorrect
packet.  It should have deleted the first character from the buffer and
then retry starting from what was left, but instead it deleted the
character before the point where it detected an error, and so it actually
corrupted the data in the buffer and re-scanned that.

In cases like the zodiac, where an error could be found after having
scanned 10 bytes into the buffer, this was clearly the wrong thing.  I am
not sure if it could happen with NMEA, because it has a simpler structure.

But it has been fixed in the current svn head, so if you still have this
problem it must have a different cause.
