<PRE>Chatting with some Windows users, I found that there could be some demand
for gpsd in those circles as well...
I presumed that there would be a &quot;Microsoft GPS API&quot; that applications use
to talk to those USB receivers, but apparently there isn't.  Applications
talk to a COM port (maybe a virtual port that appears when a USB device is
plugged in) and directly read NMEA data.

So, when you want to use more than one application at the same time you
are out of luck.
I figured it should be possible to make gpsd run under Windows, when
someone picks that up.

Considering the existing apps, ideally the daemon would create some
&quot;virtual COM ports&quot; that will output NMEA data when connected.  However
that will probably require some in-depth Windows knowledge.
Alternatively, one could use a separate application that provides the
&quot;virtual COM port to TCP connection&quot; mapping (these exist for accessing
dialout modems located on access servers, for example) and let that
connect to gpsd via TCP.
It would help when such a session started with R=1 by default.

Any thoughts?  Or are we simply against any Windows support?
