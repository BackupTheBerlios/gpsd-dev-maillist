<PRE>&gt;<i> Following a flurry of minor bugs, the queue is now clear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of those bugs exposed a problem in gpsdrive, which however I doubt
</I>&gt;<i> gpsdrive will fix because the bug hews to the letter of the NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> standard. Since I consider to be among our most important client apps.
</I>&gt;<i> I want to ship 2.26 ASAP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any urgent bugs or issues for 2.26, speak up now.
</I>
Would it be possible to be a little more patient and allow people to send
in reports and/or to find problems?
I see an urge to release a new version every week, which does not seem to
be warranted by new features.
I doubt that the audience is looking for a new version to install.
When you want to have an easily accessed version for people to try the
newest fixes, I think it is better to put a &quot;nightly build&quot; up for
download.

My opinion is that a current priority should be to walk through the code
to find possible inconsistencies, to try to validate returned data, and to
investigate the functionality we are trying to provide and see what things
are still missing there.

Examples are:

- validate that all received values are correctly scaled to the documented
units.  I have been busy with this but then someone else still found an
error (NMEA speed)

- check that &quot;xxx_NOT_VALID&quot; values are outside the normal range for that
value.  check if we could use magic values like &quot;nan&quot; instead of arbitrary
constant values

- work a bit on the demo applications to provide a good first experience
after installation, and also make them more useful for our own testing


There also are some problems that need additional investigation.
For example, when having two receivers connected and disconnecting one,
when a packet error occurs the program starts to hunt for correct data
from that specific receiver and completely forgets about the other.
It also does not handle client requests anymore.
Of course this is because while doing packet_sniff the program does not
walk through the main select loop.  I think we either need to modify the
packet_sniff code so that it becomes part of the main loop, or we change
to multithreading and start a separate thread  for every receiver while
the main loop concentrates on handling the clients.

I have also noticed today that while the system is heavily loaded the
program can be forced into such an error situation where it ends up doing
packet_sniff all the time and not recovering.  Because the usleep in
packet_sniff is very small, the CPU usage is high, and the heavy loading
problem is worsened.


At the moment I am working on a driver for my Trimble receiver.  It
handles a few received packets, but I need to decode more and also handle
the sending of control packets (to enable sending of other messages).  I
will require a day or two to finish it.
