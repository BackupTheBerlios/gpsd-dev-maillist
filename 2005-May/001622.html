<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Satcounter is sirf only. It does not exist when sirf is not enabled, yet
</I>&gt;<i> it is
</I>&gt;<i> used in zodiac.c today. This must be a recent addition, since I had just
</I>&gt;<i> fixed all of those. What is done here means nothing to me. I see what the
</I>&gt;<i> code does, but there is no way for me to guess why this is done, or (for
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> matter) why this should not be done when sirf is not enabled.

You can delete that if statement and the break below.
It was an attempt to solve a problem but it did not work anyway.
(although the addition has the same function as in sirf.c. so one could
also argue that it should remain there and the conditionals in gpsd.h
should be removed so that satcounter is always available)

Do you have a zodiac receiver?  Does the W command work for you?
I have repaired the zodiac recognition (although it needs another change
that I posted here) but for me the W command outputs only Y packets and no
O packets, while an explicit O query returns the O packet.
I suspected that it might be caused by the back-to-back 1000 and 1002
packets sent by the receiver, so I added the satcounter check, but it did
not fix it.
I am still puzzled what is going on.
