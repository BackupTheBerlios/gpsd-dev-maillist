<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Probably, but since this is my first day of using splint I have not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; learned it yet.  There is an option called +charint that tells
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; splint to tread characters as integral types.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is insane to pickup a new tool like this, and without having
</I>&gt;<i> even a day of experience start editing like mad to make all code in an
</I>&gt;<i> existing project comply with its taste, one day before release of a new
</I>&gt;<i> version.
</I>
Well...I had already concluded that releasing tomorrow would be a mistake.
I just hadn't gotten around to mentioning it yet :-).

&gt;<i> This is not going to improve the product quality on the short term.
</I>&gt;<i> I think you should not focus on bringing the count of warnings down, but
</I>&gt;<i> instead read through them and see what problems its warnings are based on
</I>&gt;<i> and decide how they should be fixed.
</I>
That's hard to do when you're looking at 2500 messages.  We have to bring the
count down, or we won't be able to see the real ones in the clutter.  I'm
not just theorizing when I say this, I started to spot real problems when
the warning count dipped below about 1300.
 
&gt;<i> Pedantic warnings about (int)0 not being equal to (unsigned char)0, which
</I>&gt;<i> are even false because C defines they are equal, should not lead you into
</I>&gt;<i> making edits that are later regretted because they conceal implicit casts
</I>&gt;<i> that are really harmful.
</I>
You have it backwards.  splint *reveals* implicit promotions and casts.
Unfortunately it does rather too good a job of this and has to be 
restrained a bit. I've already enabled +charindex, which tells it not
to bitch about using char or unsigned char as array indexes.

&gt;<i> Issues like replacing !value with value==0 are just personal tastes of the
</I>&gt;<i> writer of the tool.  They are defined to be the same, and you choose which
</I>&gt;<i> one to use based on the situation.  The first is normally used in
</I>&gt;<i> true/false checking situations, and the second is used when you are
</I>&gt;<i> looking for a numeric value of zero.
</I>&gt;<i> Blindly replacing something like !have_fix with have_fix==0 is not
</I>&gt;<i> improving quality, rather worsening it (because readability improves
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of the code by future maintainers and would hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> prevent some mistakes when changes are made).
</I>
No worries.  I agree with you that those changes were a readability
problem; I grew unhappy with them and have instead started to use
stdbool.h and splint's facilities for checking booleans as a separate
type.  The exiguous ==0 and !=0 checks are almost all gone now, and
I'll get rid of the rest over the next day or so.

So: (a) your criticism is welcome, and being heeded, but (b) relax.  What
I'm doing here is exploratory -- if I screw the pooch, it's easy enough
to back up.  (Subversion's whole-directory commits are an immense 
advantage here, as Gary finally noticed earlier today.)

I'm slowly figuring out how to annotate the code so that splint can do a 
pretty good job of flow analysis on the memory allocation.  That's where
the big payoff will be, I think.
