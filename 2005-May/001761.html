Is it practical for you to plugin the same receiver to a completely
different system and see what it does there?
Easiest for us of course when it is running Linux (another distribution)
and you can try gpsd, but a system running Windows and a program that uses
SiRF binary mode (for example the SiRFdemo program) would be possible as
well.

When you see the same problem there we can at least point at the receiver.
Until then I don't really want to do that as there are many unknowns in
the time conversion.
(maybe we should stop using libc conversions for binary-&gt;string as well,
just as we did for string-&gt;binary conversion which just never worked
right)
