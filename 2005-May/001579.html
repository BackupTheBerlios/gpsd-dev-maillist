<PRE>Remco Treffkorn &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">remco at rvt.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The real issue is the ~10 second difference between xgps Zulu and ntp slaved 
</I>&gt;<i> system time. Please refer to the screen shot.
</I>
Right.  I don't have an explanation.  I'm not seeing that difference here.
 
&gt;<i> I presented a list of observations, some real, others may be just perceived.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe now is a good time to focus on qa for a little. I currently have not a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of faith in gpsd. This is entirely my fault, because I have not followed 
</I>&gt;<i> along as carefully as I should have. 
</I>
I will, of course, welcome your getting re-involved.  I've been getting
pretty good bug feedback from Gary Miller and Rob Janssen, but more is
always welcome.  Because it relies on time-varying inputs that are hard
to check independently, getting good test coverage for gpsd is tricky.

&gt;<i> When Rob made me look at the code again, I saw things that looked 
</I>&gt;<i> questionable. What I saw may be bugs, misinterpretations, a bad gps, or a 
</I>&gt;<i> drunk observer. Please indulge me, and help me work through my troubles.
</I>
Of course.

&gt;<i> One point on the list I made has been explained (speed diff between xgps and 
</I>&gt;<i> xgpsspeed), but the others are still open.
</I>
OK, let's work through them in order.  Here are the post-2.23 change
notes for SVN head:

- Crazy-speed bug is finally fixed. Autobauding now starts with the
  current speed of the device, not the stored gpsd speed; this means
  hunting only takes place when device and GPS speed aren't matched.  
  xgpsspeed unit-conversion bug introduced in 2.23 is fixed.  Satellite
  display now really shows 12 channels, not just 11.
