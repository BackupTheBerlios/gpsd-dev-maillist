<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I think the problems with USB receivers reported by two people should be
</I>&gt;<i> investigated.
</I>
I know of one bug report that could fall in this category --
Roeland Th. Jansen reporting no data from a BU-303. Since I have a BU-303
and mine is working, I suspect something specific to him is going on.

What's the other report you're thinking about?

&gt;<i> It would also be nice to know a possible cause for Remco's 10-second offset.
</I>
Yeah, it sure would.  But the last we heard from Remco he seemed to have 
concluded it was a defective GPS and was planning to ship it to Carl Carter.
I don't think we want or need to wait on that.
 
&gt;<i> I have not read about the SHM patch but I see it has been merged.
</I>
Yes, it has.  Nice work.

&gt;<i> However, I am not sure if something has to be done about the bindings.
</I>
Thanks for reminding me, I think it means I have to bump the shared-library
major version because it made an incompaible structure change.  
It didn't change the function-call API, though.

&gt;<i> I think this is a bit superfluous.  However, it would be valuable to have
</I>&gt;<i> a commandline option that sets the first segment that can be used by gpsd,
</I>&gt;<i> in case someone does not want it to use segment 0.  What letter would you
</I>&gt;<i> consider acceptable for a new option?
</I>
None, until I hear an actual use case for this.

I'm extremely resistent to adding options.  I'll do it if we have a real
user who explains why he has to set a nonzero segment, but no sooner.

I think I'll add a note to the HACKING file explaining why.
