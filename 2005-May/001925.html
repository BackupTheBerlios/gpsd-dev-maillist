<PRE>There has been much talk recently about focusing on improving the
quality of the gpsd code.  I have taken what I believe will be a
valuable first step in that direction.

Some of you may know about splint.  If you don't, see &lt;<A HREF="http://www.splint.org">http://www.splint.org</A>&gt;.
To improve the quality of the code and detect problems such as
potential memory leaks, null references, and iffy float comparisons, I
think we should adopt the goal of getting this code to splint clean.

I have added a 'make splint' production to Makefile.am and a .splintrc
file.  I have made the needed code changes to get splint to run to 
completion on the gpsd code without tripping over undefined types.  

There are presently 1782 code warnings, down from about 2500 when I
first got splint to run to completion.  I will be continuing to work 
on reducing that number.  You should probably svn up, as my
cleanup made a large number of small and widely dispersed changes.

If you are responsible for a driver or other significant portion of
the code, please examine the make splint report and try to clean up
your bits.  90% of the warnings are noise, but it is worth cleaning
up after them in order to be able to see the 10% of signal.

If you are a lurker looking for a way to contribute, small cleanup 
patches that fix splint warnings would be a good way to start.

If we can get the code to splint clean, I think maintaining that
property will help ensure that changes don't break anything.
