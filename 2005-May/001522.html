<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is my first cut at a PPS synchronisation for NTP.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It actually is simpler than I thought before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the direction this patch is going, but I think it needs more
</I>&gt;<i> work before being incorporated in the mainline.
</I>
Yes, this is the reason I posted this to the list.
But I don't know if anyone here actually has a receiver that outputs PPS...
It certainly needs testing and maybe something needs to be done in a
different way.  Like using 2 SHM segments instead of sharing one.
I would like to know other people's opinions on that.
I would mean more configuration of NTP, but also more control.


&gt;&gt;<i> Right now it calls nice(-10) but I have also experimented with other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scheduler settings.  Unfortunately it turns out that gpsd eats all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processor time during startup (hunting for the correct speed) so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to change, or else the entire system hangs for a while when gpsd is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I may have fixed this earlier today.  I'll be curious to know whether
</I>&gt;<i> the usleep(3) I inserted make a difference in your environment.
</I>
Yes, it is OK now.  It used to spend 12 seconds of CPU time in startup (ps
indicating 0:12 after starting) but this no longer is the case.

&gt;&gt;<i> I also found that there seems to be no strict separation between client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and server side routines and libraries.  For some reason the code in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libgpsd_core.c gets pulled in by xgps as well, requiring a -lpthread
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well.  That is not correct, I think.  Clients should get linked only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the routines required at their side of the TCP connection, not with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stuff that is internal to gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is a bug and should be fixed.  I will try to identify the
</I>&gt;<i> reason for it.
</I>
Probably best to put only client-side code in libgps and create a separate
lib for gpsd, or just link the correct .o files together for gpsd.
(a lib could have been used to selectively include code required only in
specific configurations, but right now the affected .c files have #ifdefs
all around them anyway)
