<PRE>&gt;<i> The bug list is, except for Roland Th. Jansen's report of a BU-303 not
</I>&gt;<i> returning data, empty (my BU-303 still works fine).
</I>
I have not heard of him again, he is working irregular shifts so we
have a timezone difference although we live within 20 km of eachother.
(12.5 miles for the si-impaired)

&gt;<i> Question for Rob Janssen: now that we have PPS support, is reducing
</I>&gt;<i> serial-message jitter still important? The to-do item about changing
</I>&gt;<i> the FIFO threshold has been sitting there for a long time. I think
</I>&gt;<i> you're the only person with the motivation to do it and the know-how
</I>&gt;<i> to test the results.
</I>
PPS support in the code is good, but in the receivers it seems to be poor.
I have yet to see a first report of someone using it.  I have two
receivers that work, but does someone else?
After reading docs and also Carl's mail, I believe that the FIFO is only a
very small part of the problem.  At 4800 baud it could be responsible for
maybe 15ms of jitter.  That is less than what I typically see at 19200
baud, and much less than the &quot;wander&quot; that I observe routinely.
What I see happen, especially with the SiRF (much less on the Zodiac!) is
that the jitter is in the 10-30ms region but the offset is of the order of
50-200 ms.  That means the messages are relatively consistent from second
to second, but there is a slow change over time.
This is consistent with what Carl wrote about the way those messages are
output.

It would be advisable to make sure that message 52 (PPS time) is enabled
when possible.  I have not yet researched how that would be done, but I
have added support for handling this message should it be arriving.


&gt;<i> Another question for Rob Janssen: if a device has an ntpshm segment
</I>&gt;<i> attached to it, and the device is removed, what should happen?  Does
</I>&gt;<i> the answer change if there is another device active with no attached
</I>&gt;<i> segment?
</I>
What happens now is that the segment is made available for use when this
or another receiver comes back.
There is a hypothetical problem where one can turn the system
non-operative by plugging in 3 or more receivers and then unplug the first
two, but how realistic is that to happen?
Of course one could scan all operating receivers again when one is removed
to see if the freed segments could be given to someone else, but that also
makes it harder to predict which segment goes to which receiver.
In ntpd one has to configure 2 or 4 segments and one can assign a priority
to one of them.  It would make sense to give segment 1 priority because it
is the PPS output of the first receiver.  When segments are re-assigned by
plugging it will be difficult to predict what goes where.

&gt;<i> But this stuff is just polishing.  If there's anything else any of
</I>&gt;<i> you think actually still *needs* doing, I'd like to hear about it.
</I>
I think a scan should be made along all the possible error fields and
other uncertainty info and make sure that for each protocol the data ends
up in the right place.  There are no fields for some of the dop values and
they are just discarded.
More of this data should be displayed in xgps (maybe after clicking some
&quot;advanced...&quot; button).

I would like xgps (or another program) to be more like sirf(mon) in that
it be a dashboard where as much as possible of the operation of the
receiver can be overseen.  I also thought about a version of sirfmon that
can attach to the daemon.  This could take the form of a &quot;really raw&quot; mode
(R=2) that passes on everything received from the serial link,
untranslated.  And also allows a &quot;raw command&quot; to be sent.  Then we would
not need to stop the daemon to do closer study and control of the
receiver.
