<PRE>&gt;<i> dumb question, but it warrants asking:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> did the trees in your backyard recently aquire leaves?
</I>
My findings until now are that the reception of satellites that are
correctly located is completely normal.  &gt;40dB C/N above 10 degrees,
somewhat less below that.

But it is structurally miscalculating some of the satellite positions!
I have just coldstarted it again completely and not yet fired up gpsd,
I just monitor what it is doing with (my original version of) sirfmon.

It outputs: vis 14: 11 15 17 22 23 28 21 14 25 26 1 10 29 19

But this is wrong.  My sattracker program tells me that this list is ok:
11 19 03 22 15 18 08 16 26 27 21 29

So there are some sats that are OK in the list, and indeed those are
received and the indicated position in the satlist is OK.  But other sats
that it tries to receive are below the horizon so the calculated position
is completely wrong.

In the past, with this same receiver and the same software, I have seen 11
or 12 satellites correctly tracked.  Now there seems to be a mystical
upper bound of 5.  But they are not the first 5 positions in the table,
and the number of channels (also indicated in the debug output) is still
12.

I am puzzled.  Could there have been some value that is overflowing a
specific field, triggering a bug in the receiver firmware?  Or some recent
change to GPS that could affect some old receivers?

One thing I noted this weekend was that the raw almanac output seemed to
be incorrect.  A byte where a value of 56 had to be extracted from 6 bits,
always had value 00 or FF (so the field was 0 or 63 and never 56 as the
code expects).  I was thinking about a sign extension problem then, but as
the almanac data is very complicated I could not find a cause.
Maybe the same thing is now happening to the receiver's internal ephemeris
table, resulting in incorrect calculations.

However, when it has acquired enough satellites it comes up with a correct
position every time.  So at least some satellites are calculated
correctly.
