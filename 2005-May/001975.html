</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that on a typical P4-class CPU, on wich execution speed
</I>&gt;<i> depends more on the execution path than on the actually executed
</I>&gt;<i> instructions, the multiply will be orders of magnitude faster.
</I>It seems to me that this problem is simply too much machine and compiler
dependant. So we may only hope in gcc's optimizing capabilities (if gcc
is used)...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To make the warning go away, magic comments need to be inserted.  But
</I>&gt;<i> alternatively, we could write:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> z = sqrt(x*x + y*y);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and make splint shut up.
</I>I still believe all these workarounds only give us worse code readability.
If we really think that a totally &quot;splint clean&quot; capability is
important, we may consider spending some time configuring it exactly how
we need it to work.
At the beginning we started changing the &quot;flavor&quot; (style) of the code to
make splint happy, now we make splint understand how we like the code...
and we should continue &quot;teach&quot; splint how to read our code...

gpsd is powerful, and it is more powerful because it is BSD licensed and
its code is quite simple to understand. I don't think many
/*@comments@*/ like this wold make it more powerful, and we should
consider the negative weight of these comments against the discover of a
few bugs which are also difficult to happen.
It may be boring, but maybe hand checking twice the code could save us
from the splint's unforgiving eye! ;-)
