&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 10+2 ~ 13.  One is reporting GPS time, the other GMT.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So the 'Z' at the end does not mean 'ZULU'?

</I>&gt;<i> page.
</I>
As Rob pointed out: 10+2 ~ 13.
Using just a wall clock, I am surprised I got this close :-)

The real issue is the ~10 second difference between xgps Zulu and ntp slaved 
system time. Please refer to the screen shot.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I am worried that WRT the three above problems we are trying to be

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is the point I am trying to raise.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only service guaranty gpsd should make is that what it tells you is

Laudable.

&gt;<i> Weren't you at all involved in the &quot;new-protocol&quot; discussion?  It didn't

</I>&gt;<i> clear about the goal at that time.
</I>
You are missing my point. I am not trying to start a philosophical debate.

I presented a list of observations, some real, others may be just perceived.
Maybe now is a good time to focus on qa for a little. I currently have not a 
lot of faith in gpsd. This is entirely my fault, because I have not followed 
along as carefully as I should have. 

When Rob made me look at the code again, I saw things that looked 
questionable. What I saw may be bugs, misinterpretations, a bad gps, or a 
drunk observer. Please indulge me, and help me work through my troubles.

One point on the list I made has been explained (speed diff between xgps and 
xgpsspeed), but the others are still open.

Cheers,
Remco
