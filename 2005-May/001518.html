<PRE>Here is my first cut at a PPS synchronisation for NTP.
It actually is simpler than I thought before.

When the device is activated, a thread is started that waits for DCD line
changes.  It autodetects the polarity and syncs the clock when the
detected edge is 'close enough' to the system time.  This means the normal
message-based timing has to pull the clock to within 100ms first.
This is necessary to avoid false locks (a second ahead or behind), but it
may  cause trouble when accuracy of the timing info is not good enough.
I have considered using two separate NTP SHM segments for the two
different sync sources, but for now they share one.  This means you cannot
use NTP fudge time to move them around independently, that will have to be
done inside gpsd.
We will have to see if this is practical.

The thread gets blocked when there is no PPS info but it neatly exits when
the device is closed.  Not a real problem, I think.  It could be forced to
exit after some timeout with an alarm call.

To have this working, you need a GPS that pulses the DCD line at each
seconds mark.  This probably does not happen with USB devices, but you can
always try...   When using -D 5 it should print a message each second:

gpsd: ntpshm_pps: precision -16

This means the pps time offset from system time is 2^-16 s at that moment.

Open issues:

- it should probably be a configuration option to include this code
- it uses an ioctl that probably only exists in Linux
- it requires the pthreads library, so that should be added to the linking
- it would work better when scheduling options are set

Right now it calls nice(-10) but I have also experimented with other
scheduler settings.  Unfortunately it turns out that gpsd eats all
processor time during startup (hunting for the correct speed) so that has
to change, or else the entire system hangs for a while when gpsd is
started.

I also found that there seems to be no strict separation between client
and server side routines and libraries.  For some reason the code in
libgpsd_core.c gets pulled in by xgps as well, requiring a -lpthread there
as well.  That is not correct, I think.  Clients should get linked only
with the routines required at their side of the TCP connection, not with
stuff that is internal to gpsd.
