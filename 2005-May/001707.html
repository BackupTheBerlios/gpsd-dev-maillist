<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The newest version in svn has some fixes but I don't think they will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (they are extra checks to avoid setting the time from the receiver when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not have a fix)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is what I can do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Print the values from the packet which will be used to compute the time,
</I>&gt;<i> together with local time (ntp synced, so it's close). This way some body
</I>&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;<i> knows sirf could blame the gps or gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything else I should print?
</I>
I don't think printing values is going to solve much.  The result will be
that it prints times that are 10 seconds off.
I also looked in the -D dump that you posted on a website, and the entire
packet contents are printed there.

It looks like your receiver is not outputting either GPS time or UTC time...
The message 0x29 time, which is supposed to be UTC, is all zeroes on your
receiver.  This is consistent with the comments in the code that say that
this does not work before version 232 (and yours is 231).
So, the program uses messages 0x02 and 0x04.

The time fields there are supposed to be GPS time.  sirfmon prints them
unmodified.  You report that they are &quot;a second or two ahead of UTC&quot; but
they should have been 13 seconds ahead.
gpsd subtracts the leap_seconds from that, which should be 13.  That is
how you get your &quot;10 seconds behind UTC&quot; time.

It sort of looks like this particular receiver attempts some GPS-&gt;UTC
correction of its own, by subtracting a fixed 10 or 11 seconds (that may
have been valid at the time it was built).
We will have to find some way to turn that off, or to identify the actual
offset and an indication that it is being applied.
