<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> One could also argue that it claims another SHM segment that is lost for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other purposes (like connecting 4 receivers without PPS???).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but the SHM interface is a mess that will need to be rethought
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>
We are dependent on ntpd for this.  It could be increased to 16 segments
but  it would require recompilation.  Not very practical.
I would prefer using the time information from the first or first and
second receiver only.
The argument to the ntpshm functions should be changed back from context
to session (session holds a pointer to context) so the functions could use
this information in some way.

&gt;<i> One of the things I'm thinking is that if a GPS emits PPS, the message-
</I>&gt;<i> derived time isn't interesting.  So maybe it should just use one segment
</I>&gt;<i> per device, and keep a state flag to tell it that if it's seen a PPS it
</I>&gt;<i> should stop sending SHM updates on message time.  What do you think?
</I>
It worked this way until my last patch.  Then I changed to 2 segments.
This has several advantages:

- you can use /etc/ntp.conf fudge to configure the offset between message
time and real time, when the magic constants in the code are not correct
for your receiver

- you can observe the offset and jitter of message time even when the
clock is locked to PPS

- you can easily see if PPS is functioning by looking at ntp status

- less chance of trouble when a message arives late.  in the original code
this would cause immediate loss of PPS lock, with the jitter ntp is
observing jumping op from microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds.  now,
the segment with PPS info remains stable and only the message segment
jitters.  ntp is not looking at that one when PPS lock is in action.

I think we must not try to do better than the filtering and
frequency/phase locked loops already present in ntpd.  Just providing raw
information without tricks is best.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The code is very careful to only honor CD pulsing that looks like PPS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I see it's checking that the time since last transition is around 1
</I>&gt;<i> second.  What's the significance of the variable &quot;pa&quot;?
</I>
The PPS pulse normally is a short pulse with a frequency of 1 Hz, and the
UTC second defined by the front edge.  But we don't know the polarity of
the pulse (my two receivers output a different polarity).
The pa variable is used to determine which way the pulse is going.
The code assumes that the UTC second is changing when the signal has not
been changing for at least 800ms, i.e. it assumes the duty cycle is at
most 20%.
