Ok, let's be subjective.

In 1996 I almost died. I tried to enter Moro Bay harbor in the fog with a 
broken radar. But what the heck, I have this fancy moving map thing with a 
gps. Let's see, ya, heading right for the harbor entrance. Should be close 
now. The breaking waves sound funny, echoy. Like in a big empty room.
Strange. Outboard motor noise from the left, better sound the horn, and stop.
Don't want to run into some body.

Out of the fog, 15 yards away, comes a sailboat running on outboard, going 
south. I yell, and ask him where he is going. Moro Bay, he says. Turns out 
he's local, and knows what he is doing. So I make a right turn, and follow 
him south, and safely into the harbor.

Analyzing my track later, I was headed right for Moro Rock. The echo effect 
was the wave noise bouncing of the rock cliff. If it were not for the sail 
boat, gpsd development would have ended right then and there.

Sure, I was stupid to rely on a single source of navigation, but it felt safe 
enough at the time.

Ever since then, my credo for gpsd was: It may not tell you anything, but it 
will never tell you a lie!

There are not too many OSS projects that can kill you outright, like gpsd can.
Sure, it's their own fault, they should not rely on a single source of 
navigation. But people are stupid, and I am (luckily) living proof of that.

This is why I think, gpsd is unlike any other OSS project, and a more 
conservative approach to QA is justified.

I can understand Eric's motivation, I can understand Rob's point of view, and 
I sure hope I made my point.

I don't care so much about this particular release, I am more interested in a 
general solution, that works for all of us.

Like a stable version ( tested to hell and back by the process we are using 
now) and an experimental/development version (what we have now).

Currently, we don't have a stable version that would satisfy my standard.
I consider anybody relying on gpsd an idiot. And I chose the word 'relying' in 
contrast to 'using'. Use it all you want, just don't rely on it.

I would like to have a version of gpsd that people can rely on. I believe 
that's what we all are working on. But, we don't have that, and we better 
start telling people that.

End of part 1  :-)

Cheers,
Remco
