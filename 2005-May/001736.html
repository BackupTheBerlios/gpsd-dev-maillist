<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Is there any reason the PPS code shouldn't always be compiled in if NTPSHM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support is enabled?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not really.  It was not included because it requires the pthread library
</I>&gt;<i> and an extra thread.
</I>
This doesn't bother me, not on modern machines.  I've add a note to the
install file about how to build without threads.

&gt;<i> One could also argue that it claims another SHM segment that is lost for
</I>&gt;<i> other purposes (like connecting 4 receivers without PPS???).
</I>
Agreed, but the SHM interface is a mess that will need to be rethought anyway.

One of the things I'm thinking is that if a GPS emits PPS, the message-
derived time isn't interesting.  So maybe it should just use one segment
per device, and keep a state flag to tell it that if it's seen a PPS it
should stop sending SHM updates on message time.  What do you think?

&gt;<i> The code is very careful to only honor CD pulsing that looks like PPS.
</I>
Yes, I see it's checking that the time since last transition is around 1 
second.  What's the significance of the variable &quot;pa&quot;?

&gt;<i> It could be a problem when the signal actually is a 10 KHz signal which
</I>&gt;<i> would eat a lot of processor time, but this is not very likely.
</I>&gt;<i> (I have a GPS receiver that outputs such a signal but nobody would connect
</I>&gt;<i> it to DCD on an RS232 converter I think)
</I>
I think this is a good reason to leave the ENABLE_PPS symbol in place but
switch the default to &quot;on&quot;.  Which, for purposes of my zero-config goals, 
is good enough.
 
&gt;<i> Carl mailed to me that he knows of no USB GPS receiver that supports PPS. 
</I>&gt;<i> Too bad, actually.
</I>
I'll make a note of this.
