<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> We don't have fields for TDOP and GDOP.  The sirf code to store them is
</I>&gt;<i> commented out, and the dop calculation in gpsutils.c simply omits them.
</I>
GDOP is derived.  It's the sum TDOP^2 + HDOP^2 + VDOP^2

The SiRF code to store them is commented out because SiRF doesn't actually
report them.  All it ships is HDOP.  Which is why we compute VDOP and
PDOP.

Adding a field for TDOP would be worth considering if any GPS actually
reported it.
 
&gt;<i> We have several ep* variables for estimated errors as well.
</I>&gt;<i> Some of this data is part of the fix, others are in gps_data.
</I>
The only such field left in gpsdata is epe.  It's redundant with
the information in the fix structure, and only present because 
Garmin GPSes report it.

&gt;<i> Well, maybe it is not possible to provide it on the TCP interface
</I>&gt;<i> (although I do not understand why a certain command, like R=2, could not
</I>&gt;<i> switch the data received on the serial link directly to the connection... 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe it breaks the basic rules of the protocol, and the way to end this
</I>&gt;<i> mode would need to be a disconnect, but TCP is transparent).
</I>
True.  But I wouldn't do it that way as a matter of style -- I don't like
it when protocols have modes you can't back out of.  I'd rather accept
the small overhead of ASCII-armoring and then decoding the data.
 
&gt;<i> The idea is just to have some way to connect sirfmon to the receiver just
</I>&gt;<i> as if we could open a serial port multiple times and read the same data in
</I>&gt;<i> all processes.  This is normally not possible, and that is part of the
</I>&gt;<i> reason for having gpsd.  However, gpsd provides other services as well and
</I>&gt;<i> this makes the interface unsuitable for sirfmon, which needs raw data.  So
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd should provide some other interface, maybe only available to root
</I>&gt;<i> and/or to those local users that could open the COM port directly, to
</I>&gt;<i> allow raw access to the serial data.  This could be via the control
</I>&gt;<i> socket.
</I>
You need to be careful distinguishing the read side from the write side
here.

The read part (R=2, a really-raw mode) would be easy.  I could
implement it in about ten lines of code, and it raises no real design
issues at all.  Whether we do it your way (irreversible escape to raw
mode) or my way (hex encoding) is a detail.

The write side is a whole 'nother kettle of fish.  We've already 
discussed the reasons that allowing any client to send arbitrary
control strings is a bad idea.  That capability would have to be 
confined to an application that uses the control channel.
But that means sirfmon always has to be root privileged, and
must talk to a channel other than the normal client socket.

Given those two constraints, I don't see a lot of point in
tying sirfmon to the damon in any way at all.
