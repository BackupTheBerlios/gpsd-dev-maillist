<PRE>I had the pleasure to have to support windows on a project a few years ago. It 
was a server not unlike gpsd. Windows has no select()/poll(), but an api that 
lets you do similar things. Just diffrent enough so that the whole code 
structure would not easily be able to support it.

This is where Cygwin came in. What a s**t fest that became. Undocumented 
limitations in its implementation of select(), subtle bugs, bugs that had 
been known since ages, but never fixed...

A friend of mine is working with Cygwin now. I can not quote him here, bad 
language. 

I wish luck to anybody who tries, but something like this would almost have to 
be a fork.
