<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If you look, you'll see that I now cast the return value of each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; getw() to whatever the appropriate type is at the point of call.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But that is incorrect.  It will not work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The cast is not there for the purpose of defining the return type, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather the source type.  Removing it and putting casts to the desired
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result type will break the macro's functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand your assertion here, perhaps because I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> what you mean by the 'source type'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The function of the get[bwl] macros is just to pull bytes out of an
</I>&gt;<i> array and assemble them into network-order byte/word/long quantities,
</I>&gt;<i> which before being cast are bit strings of unspecified integral type.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the cast to short within getw() accomplished was to force the value
</I>&gt;<i> to be considered a signed short before the macro's caller got hold of it.
</I>&gt;<i> But that signed short is actually a register-length int, since C promotes
</I>&gt;<i> everything to register-wide ints.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, casting the return of the macro to any signed integral type at the
</I>&gt;<i> point of call should be equivalent to the 'interior' cast I removed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a different theory, please explain it more clearly.
</I>
The source type is the type as defined in the message the GPS is sending. 
it is a 16-bit signed integer.
It is pulled out of the buffer as two unsigned 8-bit bytes that are strung
together in the proper order.  But this yields a 16-bit unsigned value. 
This must be immediately cast to a signed 16-bit value.  That is what the
(short) cast in getw does.

If this is not done and it is later cast to a 32-bit signed integer value,
the 16 bits are not sign-extended into 32 bits, but the value us merely
zeropadded.  So after your change, a negative value in the 16-bit word
will appear as a large positive value in the result.
