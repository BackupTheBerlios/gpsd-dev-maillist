</I>&gt;<i> support is enabled?
</I>
Not really.  It was not included because it requires the pthread library
and an extra thread.
One could also argue that it claims another SHM segment that is lost for
other purposes (like connecting 4 receivers without PPS???).

&gt;<i> On the SiRFII + PL2303 combination I have CD never changes, so this
</I>&gt;<i> code is a no-op.  That takes care of 80% of the market right there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only way this code could be a bad thing, seems to me, is if there
</I>&gt;<i> are GPes that throw CD up and down for reasons unrelated to the PPS.
</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't seem likely.
</I>
The code is very careful to only honor CD pulsing that looks like PPS.
It could be a problem when the signal actually is a 10 KHz signal which
would eat a lot of processor time, but this is not very likely.
(I have a GPS receiver that outputs such a signal but nobody would connect
it to DCD on an RS232 converter I think)

Before I started writing it my plan was to start a timer before the loop
and kill the thread when nothing happens for a minute or so, but it turned
out to be not simple and could cause problems when the receiver is in
standby or has no fix.

Carl mailed to me that he knows of no USB GPS receiver that supports PPS. 
Too bad, actually.
