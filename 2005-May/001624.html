<PRE>&gt;<i> That's a damn good question.  Now that you've pointed it out, it's
</I>&gt;<i> obvious why this was failing for Rob Janssen -- what's not obvious
</I>&gt;<i> is why it *wasn't* failing for me.
</I>
It was Andreas who had these problems.  I just checked why it worked here
and it turns out to be because I am not completely synchronized with svn,
because I have local changes that are not in there.
After some manual editing to get in sync I have the same trouble.
It is because of the change to &quot;first try the current baudrate&quot; which
cause gpsd_set_speed not to be called and thus the baudrate field to be
set to zero.

To hopefully remain better in sync, have included a patch that adds my PPS
changes when configure is called with --enable-pps.  It is switched off by
default.
I do not completely understand the configure process.  There is a
modification to the makefile required (-lpthread added to the link) but
for now I manually edit the Makefile...  I also don't understand why
-lpthread is required to build the clients, while the clients do not
require the libgpsd_core module that calls pthreads.  When libgpsd_core is
removed from the library and manually linked with gpsd it works ok.
