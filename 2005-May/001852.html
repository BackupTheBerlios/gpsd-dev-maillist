<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> My experience is that when small bugs are found at a high rate, the
</I>&gt;<i> density is high.  I.e. there is no reason to believe that after fixing 5
</I>&gt;<i> small bugs in a week, the program is reasonably bugfree.  It is more of an
</I>&gt;<i> indication that still many small bugs exist.
</I>
Yes.  So what does this have to do with the release tempo, exactly?

If you want to argue that fixing 5 small bugs in a week means we need
more time on QA and testing, fine.  I won't argue, because I agree
with you.  But you can't turn that into an argument that the release
tempo should slow down without another premise -- e.g. that faster
releases mean more bugs.
 
&gt;<i> This is what makes open source so strong: others can find and fix bugs
</I>&gt;<i> much easier.  But it also means one sometimes has to sitdown and take
</I>&gt;<i> time, which is sometimes made difficult when there are &quot;final calls for
</I>&gt;<i> fixes&quot; so often.
</I>
Why?  You can take the time to read the code at any time.  The codebase
is not changing on such a large scale as to prevent that.

&gt;<i> That is why I mention the &quot;nighly build&quot;, by which I mean a set of files
</I>&gt;<i> like an official version, but built from the latest svn version.  This
</I>&gt;<i> allows users to download recent sources and/or binaries without having to
</I>&gt;<i> use svn or even to compile.
</I>
I'm not seeing how nightly builds would solve any problems, but that's probably
because I don't see what problems a rapid release tempo is supposed to be
creating.

&gt;<i> I went through the Zodiac driver and found many errors.  But maybe that
</I>&gt;<i> was not indicative as it seemed to be orphaned.
</I>
Yes, it had been semi- or unmaintained for quite a while before you
started working on it.

&gt;<i> I put up this point when I noticed that -1 is used for invalid latitude
</I>&gt;<i> and longitude, yet -1 is a valid value for those.
</I>
Hm.  I thought those were guaranteed nonnegative.  Hold on...no,
you're right, the range is pi to -pi.  I'll change the #defines to
something arbitrary and out of bounds like 721, I guess.

&gt;<i> &gt; OK, I like that idea, but I have some portability reservations.  Do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; POSIX or X3J11 describe #defines for max or min values?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It needs investigation.  When it would be simple, I would have sent a patch.
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed that printf with the %f format can print &quot;nan&quot; when a value is
</I>&gt;<i> not a number.  What I don't know is if  scanf can scan the &quot;nan&quot; string
</I>&gt;<i> and set the variable to not-a-number, and if #defines for this value
</I>&gt;<i> exist.
</I>
I don't know that either.

&gt;<i> &gt; Hm.  This is a significant problem with the multi-session
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architecture.  I wish you had prought it to my attention sooner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It only came to my attention during my work on the Trimble and plugging 3
</I>&gt;<i> receivers between 2 ports.
</I>
I've been looking at the code.  I don't think it will be as difficult as I
first thought.  I'll take a whack at it tonight.
 
&gt;<i> Ok, fine with me...   of course it requires a much wider change to bring
</I>&gt;<i> the sniff into the mainloop than to separate the receiver drivers into
</I>&gt;<i> separate threads, but on the other hand it could be less risky because
</I>&gt;<i> there is no locking of data in the current implementation and it could be
</I>&gt;<i> required when separate threads start to read and write into the same
</I>&gt;<i> datastructure.
</I>
You have put your finger precisely on the reason I think it is less risky.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I think increasing the usleep() would be an acceptable fix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, my feeling from the beginning was that the variable usleep was a bit
</I>&gt;<i> over-engineered and could simply have been a fixed usleep for 20 or 30 ms.
</I>&gt;<i> As long as it is above 10ms it will allow other tasks to be scheduled even
</I>&gt;<i> when those are of lower priority.
</I>
Interesting; apparently you know something I don't.  What makes 10ms a
magic number in this contecxt.

&gt;<i> However, when this code is changed to be in the main select loop the
</I>&gt;<i> FIONREAD ioctl can simply be dropped and the select will handle the
</I>&gt;<i> timeout.
</I>
Yes, I see that.

&gt;<i> What remains is &quot;why is it failing under high load&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> I have not found that yet.   I was simply copying a lot of disk data
</I>&gt;<i> (which causes some buffermanagement trouble especially with Reiserfs, and
</I>&gt;<i> thus causes swapping) and suddenly gpsd started using much more CPU, and I
</I>&gt;<i> saw that only the PPS threads were still functioning normally but the
</I>&gt;<i> packet handler was stuck hunting for valid packets.  No idea yet why it
</I>&gt;<i> got an error and why it would not recover.
</I>
I'd be inclined to suspect some trouble in the serial drive leading to
data loss, with the result looking like endless garbage to the
sniffer.  That possibility is somewhat worrisome, because we can't
fix it.  I actually hope it's a bug in gpsd instead.

&gt;<i> &gt; OK.  Is this a reason not to release?  Doesn't seem so to me.  Releases
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aren't expensive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not so much for the developer, but we must also think about the user.
</I>&gt;<i> When releases are once or twice per week, those who want to make actual
</I>&gt;<i> use of the product tend to get a little overwhelmed and do not track them
</I>&gt;<i> anymore.
</I>
I'd worry about this seriously if gpsd were a word processor or something.  
As it is, the people who are exposed to our frequent releases are pretty
hard-core techies.  I suspect they consider frequent releases a sign of
health.  It's distro-release frequencies that set the intervals for users.
