<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> PPS support in the code is good, but in the receivers it seems to be poor.
</I>&gt;<i> I have yet to see a first report of someone using it.  I have two
</I>&gt;<i> receivers that work, but does someone else?
</I>
Not me.  All my test units are USB.  Alas, when Carl says PPS seems to
be an RS323-only feature, I believe him.

&gt;<i> After reading docs and also Carl's mail, I believe that the FIFO is only a
</I>&gt;<i> very small part of the problem.  At 4800 baud it could be responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> maybe 15ms of jitter.  That is less than what I typically see at 19200
</I>&gt;<i> baud, and much less than the &quot;wander&quot; that I observe routinely.
</I>
OK, I'll remove that from the TO-DO list and add this discussion to the
hacker's guide.

&gt;<i> It would be advisable to make sure that message 52 (PPS time) is enabled
</I>&gt;<i> when possible.  I have not yet researched how that would be done, but I
</I>&gt;<i> have added support for handling this message should it be arriving.
</I>
Carl: does MID 52 need to be explicitly enabled?  If so, how is it done?

&gt;<i> What happens now is that the segment is made available for use when this
</I>&gt;<i> or another receiver comes back.
</I>
Yes, I looked at the code and saw that.  I agree with you that trying to
be more clever about it would probably just get us into trouble.

&gt;<i> I think a scan should be made along all the possible error fields and
</I>&gt;<i> other uncertainty info and make sure that for each protocol the data ends
</I>&gt;<i> up in the right place.  There are no fields for some of the dop values and
</I>&gt;<i> they are just discarded.
</I>
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're getting at here.  What &quot;right place&quot;
at what level, and which DOP fields are missing where?

&gt;<i> More of this data should be displayed in xgps (maybe after clicking some
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;advanced...&quot; button).
</I>
You mean uncertainty fields?  I agree.
 
&gt;<i> I would like xgps (or another program) to be more like sirf(mon) in that
</I>&gt;<i> it be a dashboard where as much as possible of the operation of the
</I>&gt;<i> receiver can be overseen. 
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i>                        I also thought about a version of sirfmon that
</I>&gt;<i> can attach to the daemon.  This could take the form of a &quot;really raw&quot; mode
</I>&gt;<i> (R=2) that passes on everything received from the serial link,
</I>&gt;<i> untranslated.
</I>
I don't think we could do completely untranslated.  It would have to be
hex-encoded, at least -- otherwise Bad Things would happen when data
characters happened to include \n.

&gt;<i>         And also allows a &quot;raw command&quot; to be sent.  Then we would
</I>&gt;<i> not need to stop the daemon to do closer study and control of the
</I>&gt;<i> receiver.
</I>
I've thought about this particular feature before, not in the context
of a super-sirfmon but on its own.  It's not a good idea.  The security
implications alone would be a showstopper.  If we don't restrict sending 
arbitrary data to the GPS to the control channel, DoS attacks against
applications using the GPS would be far too easy,  This might be a 
good subject for a note in the Hacker's Guide.
