<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> To keep the clock really accurate, a kernel service is required that
</I>&gt;<i> samples the system time inside the interrupt service routine that is
</I>&gt;<i> called when the status line changes.  In earlier kernels (around 2.0/2.2)
</I>&gt;<i> there was an easily applied patch that allowed this, and I think there
</I>&gt;<i> also has been a kernel module to do it.  But I can no longer locate it for
</I>&gt;<i> recent kernels.
</I>
Hmmm...interesting possibilities.

If you can find that module or recreate it yourself, I think this is
the logical project to maintain it.  Furthermore, I think a lot of
people would be happy to see us do that; from conversations I've had
on the road recently (FUDcon, Penguicon, and elsewhere) it seems our
cred as the go-to guys for all things related to GPS infrastructure is
high and still rising.

Better: I may be able to get such a module into the mainline kernel.
I think I have some chips with Linus I could call in for this, and it
doesn't sound like a bad use for them.

And note: while my personal rep has not hurt any, this project is
making influential friends mainly because we've been turning out good 
solid work and have a very talented, savvy group of core contributors 
here.  I'm proud of y'all, and other people are noticing too.
