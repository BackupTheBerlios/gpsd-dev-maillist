Along with this, I'd like to overstep my authority and speak for all
distributions that make prebuilt packages and say that frequent
releases &quot;just because&quot; are annoying. But shipping bugs is worse, so
bugfix releases are desirable.

That being said, a weekly release makes for a convenient test point:
&quot;all you users - I plan to ship this on friday as version foo. test it
against your current setup&quot;. That's what motivated me to build 2.24
wherein I discovered that the zodiac module used the
not-universally-available log2().

If the current bug list is small/empty, let's call it stable, and
don't mess with it any more. It may not have every feature out there,
but at least everything works correctly in a manner that makes sense.
We'll patch it and crank the patchlevel if we do find bugs, but there
should be a feature-frozen stable release that can be used everywhere.
Looking at the various &quot;ports&quot; systems out there, I see that there is
a lot of tolerance for a project with frequent releases, just so long
as much of the activity can be kept constrained to a -devel or
-snapshot branch and regular users can just use the -stable branch.

I'm not opposed to kicking out snapshots, and even calling versioned
development snapshots, but I would also like to see a slow moving
stable track.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
