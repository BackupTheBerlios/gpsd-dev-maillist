<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Would it be possible to be a little more patient and allow people to send
</I>&gt;<i> in reports and/or to find problems?
</I>
What good would patience do?  That is, what do you believe we would
accomplish by slowing the release tempo?  

Do you believe that this would somehow increase the amount or quality of
bug reports and fixes we get?  If so, why do you believe that?

My experience suggests the opposite, that frequent releases is better
for flushing bugs out into the open.  I wrote a paper about this once :-).

&gt;<i> I see an urge to release a new version every week, which does not seem to
</I>&gt;<i> be warranted by new features.
</I>
Indeed it is not warranted by &quot;new features&quot;.  I am proposing to
release 2.26 specifically to get a bugfix shipped -- gpsdrive wants a
leading zero if longitude is &lt;100.

&gt;<i> I doubt that the audience is looking for a new version to install.
</I>&gt;<i> When you want to have an easily accessed version for people to try the
</I>&gt;<i> newest fixes, I think it is better to put a &quot;nightly build&quot; up for
</I>&gt;<i> download.
</I>
Well, we could tell people to pull svn head for the latest version.  But
since I don't presently anticipate any benefit from slowing down the 
release tempo, I don't see why we should make testers jump through that
extra hoop.  Perhaps you will change my mind, though.

In fact, I'll go further than that: if you persuade me that you have 
a compelling theory about how and when to time releases, I will
cheerfully hand you the release-manager baton.  It's not a job I
feel any real need to hang on to.

&gt;<i> My opinion is that a current priority should be to walk through the code
</I>&gt;<i> to find possible inconsistencies, to try to validate returned data, and to
</I>&gt;<i> investigate the functionality we are trying to provide and see what things
</I>&gt;<i> are still missing there.
</I>
Quite reasonable, but I don't see what it has to do with changing the
release tempo.  My feeling is, anyway, that we're about done adding
features; this is part of what I was getting at when I write about the
to-do list shrinking.

&gt;<i> Examples are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - validate that all received values are correctly scaled to the documented
</I>&gt;<i> units.  I have been busy with this but then someone else still found an
</I>&gt;<i> error (NMEA speed)
</I>
I think that one is pretty well knocked on the head at this point.  There
aren't that many values that get scaled, and we've walked through them all.
 
&gt;<i> - check that &quot;xxx_NOT_VALID&quot; values are outside the normal range for that
</I>&gt;<i> value. 
</I>
OK.  grepping....

gps.h:48:#define TIME_NOT_VALID	0
gps.h:55:#define UNCERTAINTY_NOT_VALID	-1
gps.h:57:#define LATITUDE_NOT_VALID	-1
gps.h:59:#define LONGITUDE_NOT_VALID	-1
gps.h:62:#define ALTITUDE_NOT_VALID	-999
gps.h:65:#define TRACK_NOT_VALID	-1	/* No course data yet */
gps.h:68:#define SPEED_NOT_VALID	-1	/* No speed data yet */

There, that wasn't very hard, was it?  About the only subtle bit is noticing
that it's OK to use 0 as a time value  because GPSes didn't exist in 1969.

&gt;<i>       check if we could use magic values like &quot;nan&quot; instead of arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> constant values
</I>
OK, I like that idea, but I have some portability reservations.  Do
POSIX or X3J11 describe #defines for max or min values?

&gt;<i> - work a bit on the demo applications to provide a good first experience
</I>&gt;<i> after installation, and also make them more useful for our own testing
</I>
Here I'm in complete agreement with you.  I would like to see somebody
take a lead on this.  Preferably somebody other than me, so I can 
concentrate on the daemon.

&gt;<i> There also are some problems that need additional investigation.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, when having two receivers connected and disconnecting one,
</I>&gt;<i> when a packet error occurs the program starts to hunt for correct data
</I>&gt;<i> from that specific receiver and completely forgets about the other.
</I>&gt;<i> It also does not handle client requests anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course this is because while doing packet_sniff the program does not
</I>&gt;<i> walk through the main select loop.  I think we either need to modify the
</I>&gt;<i> packet_sniff code so that it becomes part of the main loop, or we change
</I>&gt;<i> to multithreading and start a separate thread  for every receiver while
</I>&gt;<i> the main loop concentrates on handling the clients.
</I>
Hm.  This is a significant problem with the multi-session
architecture.  I wish you had prought it to my attention sooner.

I lean towards the former.  Threading makes me uncomfortable.  I don't mind the
use of it we've made so far because it's for features that are, basically,
optional.  I don't want to make it part of the normal organization of control
if we can help it.

&gt;<i> I have also noticed today that while the system is heavily loaded the
</I>&gt;<i> program can be forced into such an error situation where it ends up doing
</I>&gt;<i> packet_sniff all the time and not recovering.  Because the usleep in
</I>&gt;<i> packet_sniff is very small, the CPU usage is high, and the heavy loading
</I>&gt;<i> problem is worsened.
</I>
I think increasing the usleep() would be an acceptable fix.
 
&gt;<i> At the moment I am working on a driver for my Trimble receiver.  It
</I>&gt;<i> handles a few received packets, but I need to decode more and also handle
</I>&gt;<i> the sending of control packets (to enable sending of other messages).  I
</I>&gt;<i> will require a day or two to finish it.
</I>
OK.  Is this a reason not to release?  Doesn't seem so to me.  Releases
aren't expensive.
