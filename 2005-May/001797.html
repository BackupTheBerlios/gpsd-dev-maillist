<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the problems with USB receivers reported by two people should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> investigated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know of one bug report that could fall in this category --
</I>&gt;<i> Roeland Th. Jansen reporting no data from a BU-303. Since I have a BU-303
</I>&gt;<i> and mine is working, I suspect something specific to him is going on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the other report you're thinking about?
</I>
I think someone else was reporting exactly the same thing with the
same receiver.  Maybe search the mail

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would also be nice to know a possible cause for Remco's 10-second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, it sure would.  But the last we heard from Remco he seemed to have
</I>&gt;<i> concluded it was a defective GPS and was planning to ship it to Carl
</I>&gt;<i> Carter.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we want or need to wait on that.
</I>
In that case, no.  But I hoped that he would connect it to another system.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have not read about the SHM patch but I see it has been merged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it has.  Nice work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I am not sure if something has to be done about the bindings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for reminding me, I think it means I have to bump the
</I>&gt;<i> shared-library
</I>&gt;<i> major version because it made an incompaible structure change.
</I>
I was thinking about your idea of setting bindings between receiver and
shm segment via the control socket.  However, I think it is not necessary.
People with 3 receivers will have to live with too few segments, or
recompile a few things.


Why don't you put a bounds check in that loop in processGPGSV?
This construct is just asking for trouble IMHO.
When out-&gt;satellites goes &gt;= MAXCHANNELS (which it does!) that loop should
just terminate.
