<PRE>&gt;<i> As a final test for my sanity:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the difference you (Rob, Eric) are seeing between the sirfmon UTC
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> local system time? +-1 second accuracy will do, never mind the TZ.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the answer is what I expect, I am willing to send the gps to any party
</I>&gt;<i> interested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the answer is not what I expect, I will fly to South Africa, and check
</I>&gt;<i> myself into a mental health facility :-)
</I>
I think I found something that may save you.

As defined in the POSIX standard, Unix time does not handle leap seconds
at all.  See the &quot;Unix time&quot; entry in wikipedia, for example.
This means that every time a leap second is inserted, Unix time for past
evens slips by one second (because the clock is reset so that the normal
conversion between &quot;seconds since 1970&quot; and display time still yields the
correct result.

It appears that people have tried to solve this, which of course fixes
some problems and introduces many others.
There appears to exist a timelibrary by Arthur David Olson (mentioned in
some articles but I could not yet find the actual thing) that uses an
epoch of 1970-01-01 00:00:10.
(probably to average between the two possible wrong choices)

Maybe your system uses this time library and thus breaks the POSIX rules?
Could you try connecting your receiver to a system that has been installed
with a different Linux distribution?

If this is the cause, we may need to detect this condition and compensate
for the difference.  However, then I first need documentation of that
library.
