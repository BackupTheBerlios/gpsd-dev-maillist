Never.  The whole point of pow is that to raise a number to an integer
power only requires simple addition to the exponent.  It is usually
hundreds of times faster than the fmuls.  For one thing the way
IEEE requires fmuls to operate FISTPL to be executed.  that flushes the
instruction pipeline on a P4 and kills performance.

In any case, since everyone now has GHz++ machines not doing any work
at all this is not really relevant to a desktop project.

</I>
gcc almost always adds that nasty FISTPL and all is lost after that.
Sure FMUL is faster than FDIV, but it still consumes hundreds of cycles.
Just flushing the pipeline with the FISTPL can cost that, then you have
the multiply.

Sadly the new Intel doc no longer gives instruction timing.  Got the
IA-32 manuals right here and it is nowhere to be found.  I'll try to dig
out some old Intel manuals when I get in to my office on Tuesday.  If
someone has a pointer to clock info on the P4 I would really appreciate
it.

&gt;<i> &gt; I would argue instead not to use a tool that imposes such silly contraints

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO, the current problem is the feverishness in which the warnings are
</I>&gt;<i> hunted down and removed.  It may be that the tool has uncovered 3
</I>&gt;<i> potential problems, the hacking of the code has also introduced at least 2
</I>&gt;<i> new bugs and possibly more.  That is not a good score.
</I>
Agreed.  The tweaking of FP math is merely a remembrance of when I got
paid to count clocks for a living.
