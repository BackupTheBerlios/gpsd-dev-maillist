I'm sure I sound like someone else when I say this, but it's more than
just Linux. Still, grasping the concept of &quot;Linux&quot; does seem do at
least half of the work of educating folks about life without Microsoft
products. For the purposes of this discussion, I will accept &quot;Linux&quot;
as shorthand for &quot;BSD, Linux, UNIX communities and all others who
reject domineering, buggy software monocultures.&quot;

I'm getting this awful confused feeling that you were thinking of me:
I feel like it might be pretentious to think so, I'm somewhat awed by
the significance of getting an open-source developer on the standards
committee, amused by it because of some prior committee experience (it
took a long time to get anything done), and a bit joyful because a
someone with real world development experience may be working on a
standard (which seems to be a rare event).

If you think I'm not gonna fumble it too badly, I'll happily work on this.
