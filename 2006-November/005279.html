<PRE>This is all hypothetical.  AdSense doesn't generate gushers of money,
by all accounts.  Realistically, it's likely to be most of a year
before we hit Google's $100 payout minimum.

If and when there's real money in the AdSense account, I'll broadcast that
fact on the dev list and take proposals for how to spend it.  Priority
will go like this:

* First, to hardware which uses different chipsets than anything we have.
  Yet another vanilla SiRF-II+PL203 device just isn't interesting at this 
  point.

* Second, to the developer willing to take the lowest subsidy.  That way
  whatever money we have gets used most efficiently.

Important point: when I pick a winner, I'll send the agreed-upon bucks 
on receipt of first useful test results, not in advance.  We *don't* 
want to create incentives for people to grab a subsidy and then vanish.

On the other hand, if you get a subsidy, you keep what you buy.  I refuse
to take on the hassle of chasing people for equipment the &quot;project&quot;
supposedly owns.  First, that's too much like work; and second it would
feel mean and ungenerous to do it.

Now please nobody bug me about this for at least six months.  We have
work to do.
