Testing! Testing! Testing!  I've never used 'gpsfake', but if I understand it, 
it can only send data from canned GPS capture logfiles. Very useful in the 
right circumstance, but not what I need ATM. For example, in testing my new 
Gtk2 'xgps', I needed to simulate the number of satellites in the 
constellation changing from 1 to 'n' (e.g. to be sure that the Gtk2 toolkit 
is doing what I expect with dynamic resizing of scrolled window contents). 
Very hard to do that with 'gpsfake'. And that's just 1 example of many.

&gt;<i> Michael's &quot;crude-but-effective NMEA data simulator&quot; might well
</I>&gt;<i> belong in our test tools.  I'm open to the possibility.
</I>
Actually, it's my tool, not Mike's. :^)

And it's way too crude (in uncountable ways) to ever make it into the GPSD 
distro.

Every so often for the last few years, I think about making a GUI version. Up 
'til now, I always come to the conclusion that my crude NMEA simulator works 
well enough for my purposes.

I bet someone, somewhere has already written some sort of GUI, open-source 
NMEA data simulator.

... Off checking Freshmeat ...

Came up empty.

... Google ...

Nothing promising-looking.

... Checking my personal GPS links ...

These guys sell one for Windows (ick!):

Hmmm.... Maybe this winter if I get really bored I'll tackle that. Of course, 
what would ESR say about the politics of putting a Gtk2-based NMEA simulator 
into GPSD without also providing a Qt-based one? G,D,R.... ;^)
