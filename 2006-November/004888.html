<PRE>I'm off to Austin tomorrow morning.  Issues for while I'm gone:

1. We're still waiting to find out if dropping back to the 3654 rev
of the TNT code un-broke it.  Massimo Burcheri, where are you?

2. I understand Gary is working on (a) fixing ntsphm (which I 
probably broke, mea culpa) and (b) resolving some strange and
probably timing-dependent problems in the Garmin serial driver
(those are *not my fault* :-)).

3.  I assume Jeff Francis is going to try to clean up what he 
described as &quot;ugly, hacky&quot; changes to cgps.

4. Chris is apparently hard at work on the iTalk driver.

Here's my wishlist for when I get back:

1. If somebody could confirm that TNT is working again, that would
make me extremely happy.

2. Chris, I think gpsctrl is close enough to working on my SiRF that
you might be able to pull it the rest of the way with an hour or two
of work.  Don't feel obligated, because that code is my responsibility
not yours -- but, if you have the spare time,..

3. I plain haven't had time to look into Petr Slansky's problem with
the PGRME messages.  (And, to be honest, I have trouble parsing his
English sometimes.)  It would be real nice if somebody would take
that off my plate.

Items 1 and 3 are the remaining release blockers.  I'd like to
ship 2.34 with gpsctrl fully working, but I'm not planning to hold
it just for that.

Gary, if you think the problems with the new Garmin serial code are
serious enough to delay the release, you get to call hold.
