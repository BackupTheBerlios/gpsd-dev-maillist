&gt;<i> Heads up, I'm working on a big patch. Possibly too big for 2.34.

This is good. I can deal with big patches given advance notice.

&gt;<i> I want to be able to write a C packet sniffer, for one of our test
</I>&gt;<i> programs, that doesn't drag in serial handling and drivers and all
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of libgpsd_core.
</I>
I was wondering when you'd say that.

&gt;<i> So what the patch does is pull apart two data structures that are too
</I>&gt;<i> entangled at the moment.  The parts of the session structure that are
</I>&gt;<i> packet-sniffer scratch storage need to migrate out to their own
</I>&gt;<i> struct.  I'm thinking maybe I might move that into a packet.h header
</I>&gt;<i> and collect all the associated magic definitions there, too.
</I>
Seems reasonable.

&gt;<i> This patch doesn't make any logic changes at all; it's the mechanical kind
</I>&gt;<i> of refactoring step where if it compiles at all you can be pretty sure
</I>&gt;<i> it's right.  Trivial changes, but lots of them and all over the place.
</I>
And are you going to compile with all possible driver combinations? it
doesn't take that long, especially if you script it. :)

&gt;<i> Consequently, if anybody is doing driver-level work, crossing with
</I>&gt;<i> this patch is liable to cause you some annoyance.  So here's how I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to play it.
</I>
As we've backed off the throttle for a bit, I don't anticipate much
hackery that this will interfere with.

&gt;<i> 1. First, I'm going to finish the patch and regression-test the bejeezus out
</I>&gt;<i> of it.
</I>
Good good.

&gt;<i> 2. Then I'm going to wait until about 3 or 4AM this morning, at which time
</I>&gt;<i> Gary and Chris (being three hours west of me) should be sound asleep.
</I>
Hah! 3 hours west of you means I'm still awake.

&gt;<i> 3. While I'm waiting, if any committer tells me &quot;Stop!  You'll
</I>&gt;<i> crap in the middle of my troubleshooting!&quot;, I'll wait for a better
</I>&gt;<i> day, possibly until after we ship 2.34.
</I>
I'm not doing anything that this would step on.

&gt;<i> 4. Otherwise, I shall hope everyone has done their nightly commits
</I>&gt;<i> and bang this sucker in there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be a good idea to svn up while you're drinking your
</I>&gt;<i> morning beverage-of-choice tomorrow. :-)
</I>
I've got other fluff to work on.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
