<PRE>  I'm at a three day-meeting in California for work, and had an hour to
spare this evening to play.  I threw together the included patch to
cgps.c, mostly just to see if I could actually do it.  There is so much
wrong with this code, I'm not even sure where I would start listing the
issues.  The point, though, was not to write beautiful code, it was to
get something on the screen as quickly as possible to see whether or not
an ASCII satellite view would even work.  Happily, if your xterm is big
enough, it does!  Crank up a nice big xterm (mine is 184x57), run cgps,
and hit the 'f' key to toggle the satellite view on and off.  I'm not
really interested in bug reports as far as functionality or code style
go, as this is going to be completely re-written the right way later
before ever going into SVN, but I *am* interested in hearing if it's a
desirable feature, and suggestions on what might make the output cleaner
(my circle-drawing algorithm, for example, draws awful circles, but it
was the first hit I came up with in a Google search).

  I've got some more fundamental stuff to clean up in cgps before I
start adding bells and whistles, but if people like it, I'll probably
add this (or a much better-written version of it) at some point in the
future.  Have fun.  It also includes almost everything necessary to
handle SIGWINCH to do window resizing (which I'll do before adding the
satellite view).
