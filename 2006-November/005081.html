<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> OS X has no build system.  Many people use &quot;fink&quot; for that.  Dunno if
</I>&gt;<i> there is a fink package for gpsd.  The OS X users I hear about are building
</I>&gt;<i> from SVN.
</I>
The fink page says: &quot;Fink uses Debian tools like dpkg and apt-get to
provide powerful binary package management.&quot; So the right thing is
to make sure xsltproc/libxslt is declared as a build-time requirement
of gpsd in the .deb the fink people are using.

Rule: anybody who is smart enough to build from SVN is smart enough to
type &quot;yum install libxslt&quot; or &quot;apt-get libxslt&quot; one time when
configure tells them they need it.  I will improve the configure.ac
message so the reader gets a clue to look for xsltlib in that case.

That takes care of both Mac OS X situations and the SVN people in general.

&gt;<i> I know about that.  It already has an xmlto dependency and that depends
</I>&gt;<i> on xsltproc.  What  I meant was the &quot;gpsd&quot; does not have the ebuild, as
</I>&gt;<i> distinct from a 3rdparty maintained gpsd ebuild.
</I>
Now it does.  It's in the source distribution and Amaury is on our dev list.
 
&gt;<i> That ebuild is still stuck at 2.32 for amd64 so no use to me.
</I>
How's that?  I don't see any version number mentioned in it.

&gt;<i> BTW, it  includes two patches to gpsd.  Not sure what they do...
</I>
Appears they're fixes for Gentoo's spin of the hotplug system.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; That's what package build dependencies are for.  I think the real bug
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here isn't failing to ship man pages, it's failing to declare the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; external dependency on xsltproc/xmlto properly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then you have to maintain all the packages instead of just one tar.gz.
</I>&gt;<i> So many distros bork the packages so badly that  whenever I care about a
</I>&gt;<i> package I get it  straight from the maintainer.
</I>
You're right.  That's why I maintain our RPM specfile and export it
with the source distro, why I cheerfuly pulled the ebuild into the
repo, and why I'd put a .deb template in the repo as well in a second
if somebody offered one.  This reduces the window in which the
packagers can screw up -- if they just take the package declaration we
ship, everything is usually fine.
