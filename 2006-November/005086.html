<PRE>Two little points: do with them what you will...

1) I've been known to extract a tarball just to read the manpages it
contains. Sometimes it's because the system I'm using the package on
doesn't have manpages, sometime reading the manpage helps me decide
whether to install the package.

2) Many projects have an explicitly stated policy that development
happens in current/HEAD... patches are to be submitted against
current. If a patch does not conform, the submitter is gently educated
on how to do it right. So we might have to do a bit of handholding,
but I don't think I've had to tell anyone more than once &quot;please use
diff -u&quot; or &quot;can you send a diff against HEAD&quot;?

When you have your Release Engineer hat on, you do things like
generate configure and Makefile.in ... I fail to see the problem with
generating other things (like manpages) that users are not expected to
change. It's not as if we're taking the sources away - we're offering
them the luxury of ignorance. They don't have to know anything about
how the documenation gets there, just that the manpages are there.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
