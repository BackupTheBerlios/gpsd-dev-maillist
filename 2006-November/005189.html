</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hm. I totally didn't get the red/black distinction. It went right over

</I>
Actually, as you probably already know, application designers should never 
rely on color alone to convey the information, since users might not pick up 
on that (e.g. colorblindness), as you've aptly demonstrated. Any good User 
Interface Guideline should mention that. And, yes, I've worked with the 
occasional color-blind user before. To me the red/black text is an extra cue, 
but not the primary one, by design.

&gt;<i> &gt; In your satellite presentation, I suspect that the color of the orb
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reflects the signal strength, but why is PRN #2 bright green when the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; others are darker green? And why do some orbs have a non-filled outline?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is that an indication of &quot;part of nav solution&quot;? And why is there an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; orange-ish, non-filled orb (PRN #135)? Is that a WAAS bird? Not trying to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;play dumb&quot; with this; I just think that it's easy for anyone to consider
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their design &quot;intuitive&quot; and others, well, not so much. :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Playing dumb is good. It makes sense to me, but there are billions and
</I>&gt;<i> billions of you out there who aren't me, who can't read my mind...
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, It sounds like you had to think about it. Thats may be a sign
</I>&gt;<i> that I need to revise my interface.
</I>
I don't know about revising it. A simple &quot;legend&quot; box would be helpful though, 
IMHO. In fact, maybe I could use my own advice and implement some text in my 
app (in one corner of the &quot;Satellite Geometry&quot; drawing area) to explain what 
a green/grey circle means.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; [ROT13]
</I>
&lt;begin de-rot13 quote&gt;

bright green for really strong signal, dark green for not quite as strong.
yellow is marginally usable. red is weak. orange is for SBAS PRNs which don't
actually contribute ranging information. Filled means they were used in the
navigation solution hollow, otherwise. You understand why the SBAS birds are
hollow, right?

&lt;end de-rot13 quote&gt;

D'oh! Missed that one. The thought of ROT13 actually crossed my mind when I 
first saw the text but was foolishly, immediately dismissed because you put 
it under '&gt; Suggestions?' instead of along with &quot;I'm not gonna tell you what 
it all means&quot;.

So I guess my intuition about your presentation of the satellite data was 
pretty close after all, eh? I guess that means that you did a good job. Or 
that we're both hopelessly brain-damaged. ;^)

But, no, I did not know the reference to &quot;SBAS&quot; at all until I Googled it. (I 
haven't seriously studied the GPS system since long before WAAS was a 
household word, at least amongst GPS geeks like those of us on this list.) 
Between Eric's &quot;Roche limit&quot; reference and your &quot;SBAS&quot; reference, I'm 
learning a lot today. :^)

And I'd still argue that my green/grey coloring to indicate &quot;part of nav 
solution&quot; is no more or less intuitive than your hollow/filled paradigm. So 
basically, so far, you haven't convinced me to change it. Maybe you and Eric 
(and Gary whenever he joins in) can gang up on me and twist my arm. ;^)

&gt;<i> &gt; Coward! ;^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hardly... I just wanted to see if you'd understand why I plotted stuff
</I>&gt;<i> the way I did. Now you unstand the concept flopping about in this blob
</I>&gt;<i> of porridge I call a brain.
</I>
I stand corrected.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Oh, one more: I'd prefer to see more elevation lines, and more azimuth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; radials. But I like that kind of eye candy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On a bigger drawing area like yours, I might agree. On the small one in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'xgps', I disagree -- too much clutter. Your drawing area is (fixed at)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 640x640 pixels -- I don't have that luxury.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you have the luxury of knowing your screen size at runtime and
</I>&gt;<i> being able to redraw accordingly. Where you have lotsa pixels, you can
</I>&gt;<i> draw ... 15degree lines... where you don't have so many... 45degree.
</I>&gt;<i> Lookee there... you suggested the same thing a couple of paragraphs
</I>&gt;<i> down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you really need to know the satellite Azim/Elev precisely, well,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's what the table is for and that's why I kept it around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not so much for the precision as to aid visualization.
</I>
How precisely do you need to visualize it? Aren't the &quot;N,S,E,W&quot; markers 
enough? Not arguing, just curious. The only time I really care about where 
the satellites are is when I'm positioning an antenna (or the receiver 
itself, in most cases, since the antenna is often built-in in my latest GPS 
hardware). In that case, I just want to know where I might be blocking a 
particular satellite's signal with part of a building, etc. Knowing that the 
satellite is &quot;SSW&quot; (or even &quot;SW&quot; for that matter) is plenty good enough for 
me. I don't really care if its 155deg or 160deg azimuth in such a case (and 
if I did, I'd look at the table).

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe we should draw azim/elev lines if the main window is resized such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the drawing area available for the Satellite Geometry is above some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pixel threshold? That, I'd consider.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't thinking of a binary &quot;has grid/no grid&quot; as &quot;how much grid can
</I>&gt;<i> we comfortably and meaningfully fit?&quot;
</I>
I might be convinced to try that. But I abhor clutter, especially if I'm 
convinced that it adds little functionality. I'll look into implementing this 
with your suggestion in mind.

&gt;<i> I suspect our wives are going to be heavily involved in the &quot;honey,
</I>&gt;<i> what does this picture say to you&quot; testing process...
</I>
But since women are statistically much less likely to be color-blind, maybe 
they're not the best choice to survey when discussing color-related issues? 
Or maybe it's just the opposite? :^)
