<PRE>Marr &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">marr99 at highstream.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I was really hoping for more people's input on this issue. Is the
</I>&gt;<i> subscription to the 'gpsd-dev' list that small or do most people
</I>&gt;<i> just have no strong opinion? Our sample size is awfully small here.
</I>
The gpsd-dev currently has 52 members.  Make of that what you will.

&gt;<i> I'm still confused about the need to pinpoint the exact center.
</I>
Sorry, it's just the way my brain works.  It's not logically
necessary, but I find it visually uncomfortable when I have to spend
effort to do that.  Call it aesthetics if you like, it's just that my
&quot;aesthetic&quot; reactions to such things tend to be very detailed and
analytical.

(My whole family is like this, by the way.  Two of my sibs are
commercial artists, a third is an architect, and I'm the engineer and
second-generation mathematician.  We figured out many years ago that
all five of us have both artist and engineer genetic talents. The
artists stand out from their peers because they think much more
analytically than normal for their professions.  And me, well, perhaps
you've noticed that the project website is quite pleasant to look at
in its spare, understated way.  Both the 'pleasant' and the 'spare,
understated' are forms of art.)

&gt;<i> &gt; How about a compromise...could you add a colored center dot, space the text
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so it's not stepped on, and then thin-wall the circle in gray so it's still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a boundary on the text but easier to ignore?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could, but the design I have now colors the circle green or gray depending 
</I>&gt;<i> on whether it's part of the navigation solution (&quot;in use&quot;) or not. So it 
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like I'd be throwing that information away with your scheme, unless 
</I>&gt;<i> you mean that I should color the &quot;center dot&quot; (1-pixel?) that way. If I 
</I>&gt;<i> agreed to that, I'd argue that a 1-pixel center dot is too small to see the 
</I>&gt;<i> color and would require a larger filled circle, at which point I'd say that 
</I>&gt;<i> the outer encompassing circle is superfluous and therefore just more visual 
</I>&gt;<i> clutter.
</I>
Fair point.  OK, how about a thin-walled colored circle and a neutral pipper?
That would make me just as happy.  In fact, now that I think about it, I'd
like it better.

&gt;<i> As you might imagine, I have been thinking about this whole issue since we 
</I>&gt;<i> discussed it yesterday.
</I>
Indeed...
 
&gt;<i> I considered shrinking the circle to an orb the size of the current Motif 
</I>&gt;<i> 'xgps' and showing PRN above and SNR (Signal:Noise Ratio) below. However, my 
</I>&gt;<i> gut feeling is that anytime you display data blocks outside the circle, 
</I>&gt;<i> there's really no controversial-free way to do it. And I don't want to go to 
</I>&gt;<i> an Air Traffic Control (radar scope) style of 'leader line to an 
</I>&gt;<i> operator-movable data block' either!
</I>
I'd actually kind of like that.  But if you throw up all over it with a 
reaction of &quot;that's too complicated!&quot;, I won't give you an argument :-).

&gt;<i> Also, I noticed that the Motif 'xgps' does some things I never
</I>&gt;<i> realized. Like putting a 1-pixel black pipper in the center if the
</I>&gt;<i> SNR is anything besides 0dB.
</I>
I did that.  I think my original intention was to highlight which
satellites are part of the nav solution -- it's not supposed to be
just nonzero dB.  I wonder if somebody mucked with it and I didn't
notice?

&gt;<i>    And it colors the PRN text label blue when the satellite is part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> nav solution and grey otherwise.
</I>
That was Chris.  I like his indicator better, so we could drop my pipper
code at this point.

&gt;<i>            I don't have any specific objection to that 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, but I'd never call it &quot;intuitive&quot;. I only noticed it while looking 
</I>&gt;<i> at the code! I think I've been arguing all along that almost nothing about 
</I>&gt;<i> any GPS satellite presentation is truly &quot;intuitive&quot;.
</I>
Chris has been arguing that point, but I'm more on your side here.

&gt;<i> I've begun to convince myself that the best way ahead might be to implement 
</I>&gt;<i> _both_ schemes -- mine and &quot;not mine&quot; (ostensibly, &quot;yours&quot;).
</I>
I'm kind of conflicted about this.  On the one hand, my Unix instincts say
&quot;the more options, the merrier&quot;.  On the other hand, what I've been learning
about good UI from the Mac world says &quot;screw that, get it *right*&quot;  And
on the gripping hand, a lot of me says &quot;don't design it by comittee!&quot;

Nevertheless, mostly because this is an educational conversation, I'll
tell you my preferences.

&gt;<i>    - Should SNR (in dB) be displayed at all? If so, should the text be 
</I>&gt;<i> colorized to indicate any SNR threshold(s)? If so, how?
</I>
I don't think numeric SNR is needed.  I'd go for green/yellow/red coding
the way xgps does it; the exact figures belong in the tabular display only.
 
&gt;<i>    - What should be the iconic representation of the satellite? A circle? If 
</I>&gt;<i> so, what radius? Filled or unfilled (or dependent on &quot;in use&quot;)?
</I>
Either a circle or a small diamond would do it for me.  It should be
just barely large enough to be visible at a glance -- that is, I want
to to be unable to mistake it for cruft on my screen, but I also want
the visual center to be as easy to pin as possible.

I'm cool with either (a) always-filled icons, or (b) filled to indicate
in-use and hollow to indicate not-in-use.  Mild preference for the former.

&gt;<i>    - What color should the circle be? Based on SNR? Based on &quot;in
</I>&gt;<i> use&quot;? Based on PRN (e.g. WAAS are different, like Kuethe's site)? If
</I>&gt;<i> SNR-based, how many colors and what colors? If based on &quot;in use&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> what 2 colors? Same question if PRN-based.
</I>
I care less about this.  I'd say color-code on SNR a la xgps and --
hah! -- use *shape* for the GPS/WAAS distinction.  Yes, that's the
right thing.  I like the idea of little disks for the GPS birds and
diamonds for WAAS.

I just had a thought.  How difficult would it be to pop up a floating
legend when you mouse-hover on a sat icon?  *That's* where SNR and
other details belong!

&gt;<i>    - If the circle does not encompass the text, where should the PRN text be 
</I>&gt;<i> drawn? In what color(s)? Where should the SNR be displayed? Both in the same 
</I>&gt;<i> block? One above and one below the circle?
</I>
I say PRN only, and I don't care where it's displayed as long as the 
relationship to the sat icon is consistent.  I like Chris's blue/gray
hack as a used indicator better than my center dot, but wouldn't
barf at filled/unfilled.

I hope that was helpful, or at least interesting.
