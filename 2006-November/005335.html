<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt;I want to be able to write a C packet sniffer, for one of our test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;programs, that doesn't drag in serial handling and drivers and all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the rest of libgpsd_core.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering when you'd say that.
</I>
Heh.  *I* was wondering if you'd see something like this coming from
the gpsfake work, and decided that was quite likely.

The goal, as you probably conjectured, is to make adding new
regression tests less of a pain in the tuchus. To that end, I've
decided I don't want to maintain two packet sniffers (one in C and one
in Python) anymore.

So I'm going to disentangle the C packet sniffer from the rest of the code
and figure out some way to glue it into gpsfake.  This patch is the first 
(and most difficult) step in the process.

&gt;<i> And are you going to compile with all possible driver combinations? it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't take that long, especially if you script it. :)
</I>
Yeah?  Show me the script :-).

&gt;<i> &gt;2. Then I'm going to wait until about 3 or 4AM this morning, at which time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Gary and Chris (being three hours west of me) should be sound asleep.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hah! 3 hours west of you means I'm still awake.
</I>
I suppose so.  Reckoned without hacker scheduling, I did.  Do you have
any particular time preference?

&gt;<i> I'm not doing anything that this would step on.
</I>
Good.
 
&gt;<i> I've got other fluff to work on.
</I>
I hope figuring out why the TSIP driver seems to start ignoring the
stuff gpsfake throws at it is on the list somewhere.  And if you can
determine that instead it's gpsfake that is somehow screwing up, that
would be useful too.

We've *got* to have a regression-test infrastructure that's sound,
especially if we're going to start adding new drivers like crazy after
2.34.
