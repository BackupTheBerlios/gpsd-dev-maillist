<PRE>I just checked in a change that gives the probe_subtype driver method a 
second argument, which is a packet sequence number -- 0 when the device
is recognized by a probe_detect method or a new device driver is switched
to, &gt; 0 just after receipt of each full packet.  

Existing probe_subtype methods have been modified so they fire only when the
sequence number is 0, except for the NMEA one.  This one now interleaves its
probe string sends with the first several packets received.

Interestingly, this seems to *immediately* make detection of SiRF devices
running in NMEA mode reliable.  That means that gpsctrl should be finished
for the SiRF case very shortly.

I implemented this because I think it might also solve Davor Emard's
problem with the Garmin GPS-10.  He was reporting that all the probe
string sends being done at once confuses that device.

Looks like even the SiRF chips are vulnerable to having their input
buffer spammed, and we were doing it inadvertently.  I have a happy
feeling that I've not just fixed a bug here, but located and nuked
what would have been a source of bugs in many future devices.
