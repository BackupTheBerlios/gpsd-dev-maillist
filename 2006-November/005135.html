Unsurprisingly, I also think that you (Eric) are taking it too seriously. In 
fact, I think casting this as a political issue is downright silly. However, 
I'm more than willing to let my new version stand or fall on its own merits 
(or lack thereof), especially since it's clear that Eric is receptive to 
adding the new code, even if it won't ever replace the old code.

As far as the Motif issue, I'm a long-time (14 years, on-and-off) Motif 
user/programmer and like the toolkit a lot, especially since its 
documentation seems to run rings around Gtk (and especially Gtk2). However, 
it seems that &quot;the writing is on the wall&quot; -- even Slackware (my beloved 
distribution of many years) has silently dropped the OpenMotif package in the 
latest Slackware 11.0 6-CD release. Yes, I know about Lesstif (I was writing 
Motif apps in SunOS and eventually GNU/Linux since before most [including 
myself] had ever heard of Lesstif -- any of you remember &quot;Moo-Tiff&quot;, the $100 
[ouch!] Motif clone for GNU/Linux?) And although I still maintain several 
Motif-based apps, I haven't written any _new_ Motif apps in many years now. 
In my experience, Motif got a very bad (undeserved) reputation from _users_ 
because the defaults were very ugly -- something that was easily changeable 
via the &quot;app-defaults&quot; settings. But I've rarely heard Motif _programmers_ 
complain too loudly about the toolkit.

Having said all that, I'm going to start a new thread to describe the new 
Gtk2-based 'xgps' in detail. I've also got a few screenshots so that you can 
see what I've been thinking about.
