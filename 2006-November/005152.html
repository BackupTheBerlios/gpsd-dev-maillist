<PRE>Marr &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">marr99 at highstream.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Yeah, I know that nobody will bother reading this -- they'll just
</I>&gt;<i> jump to the screenshots. :^)
</I>
*I* read it.  Carefully.  Seemed to be required by the sort of, er,
management job I've fallen into.

&gt;<i> To me, this new version, which mimics another of my long-used GPS
</I>&gt;<i> applications, provides a greater data density on the satellite
</I>&gt;<i> display without sacrificing too much space. In fact, this greater
</I>&gt;<i> data density is the reason that I moved the &quot;Satellite Info&quot; table
</I>&gt;<i> to a (secondary) notebook tab (more on that below), since I don't
</I>&gt;<i> see much use for it now except to provide (1) the exact satellite
</I>&gt;<i> azim/elev and (2) a nice tabulated format for times when that
</I>&gt;<i> display presentation is more useful (e.g. ordered by PRN).
</I>
I say well done.  The satellite picture is cool and geeky, but the 
tabular sat data never seemed very very interesting other than as
a sort of &quot;See?  We can do this!&quot; demonstration.  

&gt;<i> Like the old app, the new app displays and updates all of the same
</I>&gt;<i> data coming from the GPS receiver via 'gpsd', including the new
</I>&gt;<i> field to show the GPS receiver type/firmware. All that data is
</I>&gt;<i> displayed in a single &quot;tab&quot; labelled &quot;GPS Info&quot; of a 2-tab
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;notebook&quot; widget.
</I>
That's all good.

&gt;<i> I've taken the liberty of renaming &quot;GPS Type&quot; to &quot;Receiver Type&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> since I find that term more precise. More importantly, I've renamed
</I>&gt;<i> the erroneously-named &quot;Course&quot; to &quot;Track&quot;, which is what the GPS
</I>&gt;<i> receiver is actually providing, of course (no pun intended!).
</I>
Um, I guess I should fix that in xgps, then. Jeff, take a  note for
cgps.

&gt;<i> Unlike the old Motif app, which hard-codes a fixed number of
</I>&gt;<i> satellites to be displayed, thereby wasting screen real-estate most
</I>&gt;<i> times, this &quot;Satellite Info&quot; table in the new app is not constrained
</I>&gt;<i> by a fixed number of satellites. The table is dynamic and resizes,
</I>&gt;<i> using a vertical scrollbar as needed (which is not obvious in my
</I>&gt;<i> forthcoming screenshot).
</I>
Excellent!
 
&gt;<i> One of the things that I always hated about the Motif version of 'xgps' is 
</I>&gt;<i> that it only shows 1 line of raw incoming GPSD data and that there's no way 
</I>&gt;<i> to pause the display refresh (so that you have slightly more than a 
</I>&gt;<i> snowbaIl's chance in hell of reading the doggone thing).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My new version fixes both of those shortcomings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've added a scrollable, multi-line text area to show the raw incoming GPSD 
</I>&gt;<i> data.
</I>
Again excellent.

&gt;<i> I've worked to keep the overall default initial application size
</I>&gt;<i> under 800x600 pixels.
</I>
And a heartfelt thank you for writing a test client that doesn't require
the latest snazzy whizzy hardware to run.  

This indeed sounds very promising.
