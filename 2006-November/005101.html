<PRE>  Ok, first try got eaten by the remailer for being too big.  This time I'll include only the diff...




  I promise not to be perturbed. ;^)  I'd like to take you up on that.

  I've included a pretty huge patch to cgps.c.  I re-did a pretty
substantial amount of it.  It should be substantially easier now to
add/remove fields from the display.  I also re-wrote the very brittle
(and very hard to understand) code that choses what to display/omit
based on screen size.  Finally, I dropped the horizontal, altitude,
course, and speed error fields, as they give the impression of being
little more than random number generators (ie, a course error of &#177; 90
degrees and a speed error of &#177; 60mph while driving down the freeway
isn't very useful).  They're easy to put back in later, if desired. 
Omitting them allows the use of much smaller xterms (very nice for
displaying multiple cgps displays at once on a 1024x768 laptop).  I
removed the input screen, as it was mostly for show, and moved the
&quot;Status:&quot; field into the main data display.  Finally, I changed the code
to only display satellites used to generate the fix if the display is
small enough to not display all satellites.

  Thoughts?  Does it work for everyone?  Works fine with all three
public gpsd servers I know about.  Also tested with a wide variety of
xterm sizes.  I *think* I've exorcized all of the off-by-one errors from
the screen size logic.
