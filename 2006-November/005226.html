Well, without going into the details, my rating in spatial perception is very 
high too. Or, more precisely, it _was_ (about 15 years ago). Maybe not so 
much anymore!

I was really hoping for more people's input on this issue. Is the subscription 
to the 'gpsd-dev' list that small or do most people just have no strong 
opinion? Our sample size is awfully small here.

Or maybe I can assume that people who've made any comment on the topic without 
suggesting changes to the satellite representation (Petr, Remco, Mike Davis) 
are happy with it. Hmmm... Yeah, that tends to stack the deck in my favor, 
doesn't it? ;^)

&gt;<i> I'm looking at the screenshots again, and I think I understand what's
</I>&gt;<i> missing. The circles need, at minimum, a center mark or crosshairs. 
</I>
I actually had just that (a pipper [or 'reticle', if you will] at the center) 
several years ago when I first started using that display on my GPS moving 
map. The pipper got deleted not too long afterwards -- it was just more 
clutter that contributed nothing.

&gt;<i> Without that, the visual clutter from the enclosed text makes it effortful
</I>&gt;<i> for me to locate the center of each.
</I>
I'm still confused about the need to pinpoint the exact center. Between you 
wanting a pipper and Chris (and you) wanting lots of azim/elev lines, I'm 
left wondering what you guys are trying to do? How precisely do you need to 
know where the satellite is? If you want the exact azim/elev, well, as I've 
said before, that's what the table is for!

&gt;<i> How about a compromise...could you add a colored center dot, space the text
</I>&gt;<i> so it's not stepped on, and then thin-wall the circle in gray so it's still
</I>&gt;<i> a boundary on the text but easier to ignore?
</I>
I could, but the design I have now colors the circle green or gray depending 
on whether it's part of the navigation solution (&quot;in use&quot;) or not. So it 
sounds like I'd be throwing that information away with your scheme, unless 
you mean that I should color the &quot;center dot&quot; (1-pixel?) that way. If I 
agreed to that, I'd argue that a 1-pixel center dot is too small to see the 
color and would require a larger filled circle, at which point I'd say that 
the outer encompassing circle is superfluous and therefore just more visual 
clutter.

As you might imagine, I have been thinking about this whole issue since we 
discussed it yesterday.

I considered shrinking the circle to an orb the size of the current Motif 
'xgps' and showing PRN above and SNR (Signal:Noise Ratio) below. However, my 
gut feeling is that anytime you display data blocks outside the circle, 
there's really no controversial-free way to do it. And I don't want to go to 
an Air Traffic Control (radar scope) style of 'leader line to an 
operator-movable data block' either!

Also, I noticed that the Motif 'xgps' does some things I never realized. Like 
putting a 1-pixel black pipper in the center if the SNR is anything besides 
0dB. And it colors the PRN text label blue when the satellite is part of the 
nav solution and grey otherwise. I don't have any specific objection to that 
behavior, but I'd never call it &quot;intuitive&quot;. I only noticed it while looking 
at the code! I think I've been arguing all along that almost nothing about 
any GPS satellite presentation is truly &quot;intuitive&quot;.

I've begun to convince myself that the best way ahead might be to implement 
_both_ schemes -- mine and &quot;not mine&quot; (ostensibly, &quot;yours&quot;). I can add a 
'mouse button click' event handler to the graphical &quot;Satellite Geometry&quot; 
drawing area. Then, for example, a user could mouse click (left, middle, 
right, whatever) to scroll to the next presentation scheme. In fact, I'd even 
considered using the same concept to allow turning the semi-controversial 
grid lines on and off. Of course, I'd add some text to the corners of the 
drawing area as a hint about such mouse behavior.

That might be the only way to end this issue (for now) and move forward.

If I decide to implement that, I need you guys to tell me _exactly_ what you 
want. It means agreeing among yourselves on the answers to, as a minimum, 
these questions, all pertaining to just the graphical portion of the 
satellite display: 

   - Should SNR (in dB) be displayed at all? If so, should the text be 
colorized to indicate any SNR threshold(s)? If so, how?

   - What should be the iconic representation of the satellite? A circle? If 
so, what radius? Filled or unfilled (or dependent on &quot;in use&quot;)?

   - What color should the circle be? Based on SNR? Based on &quot;in use&quot;? Based 
on PRN (e.g. WAAS are different, like Kuethe's site)? If SNR-based, how many 
colors and what colors? If based on &quot;in use&quot;, what 2 colors? Same question if 
PRN-based.

   - If the circle does not encompass the text, where should the PRN text be 
drawn? In what color(s)? Where should the SNR be displayed? Both in the same 
block? One above and one below the circle?

Now you can be the designer and I'll just ask questions and implement what you 
suggest as scheme #2. This is actually much easier. Now if anyone complains, 
I just point them to you. ;^)

Seriously, let me know what you guys agree on (assuming that's possible) and 
I'll attempt to implement it as the primary scheme (with my scheme as the 
secondary). However, I reserve the right to reverse the order, based on user 
input, if this ever comes to fruition.

How's that?

Marr's theory: When a compromise is hard to reach, don't compromise -- provide 
the user with _all_ the options. ;^)
