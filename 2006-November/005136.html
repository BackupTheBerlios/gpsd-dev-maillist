<PRE>Hi all,

As I mentioned earlier this week, I've spent some (sporadic) time over the 
last several days working on a Gtk2-based replacement for 'xgps'.

The app still needs a lot of things done before it's ready to be released into 
the wild, but the GUI has come along nicely enough that I wanted to release 
this detailed description of how it all works so that I can get some 
feedback.

Since I don't know how (or if) this mailing list will handle graphical 
attachments, I'll include my screenshots in another message.

Yeah, I know that nobody will bother reading this -- they'll just jump to the 
screenshots. :^)  But I wanted to give some explanation for my changes and my 
reasoning while developing this new app.

The new Gtk2 version of 'xgps' should be mostly recognizable to users of the 
older Motif version, but there are several changes. I'd call them all 
&quot;improvements&quot;, but I'm willing to let the developers (initially) and users 
(eventually) make that call. :^)

Let's begin.....

The area labelled &quot;Satellite Geometry&quot; displays the satellite positions just 
like the old app. Some things are done differently, though. The old app just 
displayed the PRN of the satellite near the graphical representation, which 
was color-coded grey, yellow, or green depending on the signal strength.

The new version displays the PRN too, of course. However, I'm not fond of 
looking in the satellite table for details (signal strength and whether the 
satellite is part of the navigation solution) that could easily be conveyed 
right in the graphical representation of the satellite. Therefore, the new 
version also displays the numerical signal strength within the circle that 
represents the satellite. The text is color-coded red when it's below a 
certain threshold (currently 38 dB, but configurable in the code). 
Additionally, the color of the circle which represents the satellite is 
itself color coded -- green when it's part of the navigation solution and 
light grey otherwise.

To me, this new version, which mimics another of my long-used GPS 
applications, provides a greater data density on the satellite display 
without sacrificing too much space. In fact, this greater data density is the 
reason that I moved the &quot;Satellite Info&quot; table to a (secondary) notebook tab 
(more on that below), since I don't see much use for it now except to provide 
(1) the exact satellite azim/elev and (2) a nice tabulated format for times 
when that display presentation is more useful (e.g. ordered by PRN).

Like the old app, the new app displays and updates all of the same data coming 
from the GPS receiver via 'gpsd', including the new field to show the GPS 
receiver type/firmware. All that data is displayed in a single &quot;tab&quot; labelled 
&quot;GPS Info&quot; of a 2-tab &quot;notebook&quot; widget. 

I've taken the liberty of renaming &quot;GPS Type&quot; to &quot;Receiver Type&quot;, since I find 
that term more precise. More importantly, I've renamed the erroneously-named 
&quot;Course&quot; to &quot;Track&quot;, which is what the GPS receiver is actually providing, of 
course (no pun intended!).

The other tab of the notebook widget is labelled &quot;Satellite Info&quot; and displays 
the details of the satellite position and signal strength. It has exactly the 
same data as the old app. With the improved &quot;Satellite Geometry&quot; display, 
it's not really needed that often and is relegated to the 2nd tab.

Unlike the old Motif app, which hard-codes a fixed number of satellites to be 
displayed, thereby wasting screen real-estate most times, this &quot;Satellite 
Info&quot; table in the new app is not constrained by a fixed number of 
satellites. The table is dynamic and resizes, using a vertical scrollbar as 
needed (which is not obvious in my forthcoming screenshot).

One of the things that I always hated about the Motif version of 'xgps' is 
that it only shows 1 line of raw incoming GPSD data and that there's no way 
to pause the display refresh (so that you have slightly more than a 
snowbaIl's chance in hell of reading the doggone thing).

My new version fixes both of those shortcomings.

I've added a scrollable, multi-line text area to show the raw incoming GPSD 
data. Currently, I accumulate 12 lines of data but that's easily configurable 
in the code, of course. Of those 12 lines, a little over 7 of them (using an 
8-point font) are visible at one time in the text buffer. That, too, is 
configurable at the code level, by deciding how large (in pixels) you want 
the vertical portion of the widget which contains that text area.

This text area is displayed by default but can be hidden with the little 
downward-pointing arrow to the left of the &quot;Raw GPSD Data&quot; label (see the 
screenshot).

There are 2 good reasons to consider &quot;hiding&quot; the text area. (1) To avoid the 
distraction of rapidly scrolling lines of text when you're not interested in 
that data and are trying to concentrate on the other (GPS, satellite) data. 
(2) To give more room vertically to the drawing area which is used to display 
the &quot;Satellite Geometry&quot;.

The &quot;cannot pause&quot; limitation is addressed by the addition of a new toggle 
button labelled &quot;Pause&quot;. When activated, it changes to a red background and 
is relabelled &quot;Paused&quot;, as a reminder that the display refresh is halted. 
Everything stops updating when this happens -- the &quot;GPS Info&quot; tab data, the 
&quot;Satellite Info&quot; tab data, the &quot;Satellite Geometry&quot; display, and the &quot;Raw 
GPSD Data&quot; text buffer. As an additional reminder and to also act as a visual 
segregator, I write &quot;--- paused ---&quot; in the text area as well. The blue color 
of the toggle in its unselected state is a personal choice, configured via my 
Gtk resource file (more on that later).

I've added a 'De-Jitter' toggle to control the &quot;J&quot; command setting to 'gpsd'. 
Like the 'Pause' toggle, it has an appropriate tool-tip to explain its 
intent/usage.

Most of the important items (widgets) have been &quot;named&quot; in the code so that 
they may be referenced in the Gtk2 resource configuration file (e.g. 
&quot;~/.gtkrc-2.0&quot;). I'll eventually provide some intelligent samples of what one 
might add to such a file to control the application's appearance.

In general, this new app is _much_ more tolerant of things like font changes, 
resizing of the window, etc, without breaking the appearance of everything 
else. It's not nearly as fragile as the Motif version in this regard. (Note: 
The Motif version could certainly be improved -- we had that discussion 
on-list a while back [but I didn't sense much enthusiasm for that plan]; it's 
not a Motif toolkit shortcoming. However, I decided that going to Gtk2 was, 
overall, a better long-term solution.)

Of course, to fully appreciate the effect of things like resizing the window 
and hiding the &quot;Raw GPSD Data&quot; area, you need to run the app. For now, you'll 
have to take my word for it. :^) In general, the &quot;Satellite Geometry&quot; area, 
while retaining a 1:1 aspect ratio, takes advantage of any increase in the 
application's main window being resized, which is another improvement over 
the fixed-size of the satellite geometry area shown with the old Motif 
application.

I've worked to keep the overall default initial application size under 800x600 
pixels. Yes, I still have a laptop with that resolution and no, I don't plan 
to replace it (my GPS + moving map &quot;road warrior&quot;) just yet -- I'm many 
things and &quot;cheap bastard&quot; is near the top of that list. ;^) Basically, with 
my current settings, the new app is only slightly wider and slightly taller 
than the old one, but includes more functionality. The default initial 
satellite geometry display is smaller on the new app than the old, but, as I 
stated above, unlike the old app, the new app will expand the area 
intelligently as the main window is resized.

As I've said before, my new 'xgps' needs more work and a lot more testing 
before I'm ready to submit a trial version, but what I have so far looks very 
promising.

One of the many issues I still need to address is the control of the 
'units' (speed, altitude, EPH, etc). I've got some ideas on how I want to 
handle that, which will affect the screenshots, but I wanted to get some 
screenshots &quot;out the door&quot; now.

Please let me know what you guys think. Looking forward to hearing all ideas, 
comments, criticisms, etc.

Regards,
Bill Marr
