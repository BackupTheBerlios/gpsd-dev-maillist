<PRE>Michael R. Davis &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">mrdvt92 at yahoo.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I'd like to see a run-time option too because my GPS receiver still
</I>&gt;<i> has that 10 seconds delay under SiRF so I have pop it back to NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> every time GPSD has it way with it.
</I>
This is actually an argument for an /etc/gpsdrc config file, not a
command-line option.

Think about it.  The assumption that drives much of gpsd's design is that it's
going to get silently called by a hotplug script when needed.  You don't want
a way of requesting no-reconfigure that would require you to hack the hotplug
agent -- and if you *did* want that, I'd refuse to do any such stupid thing!

A config file, on the other hand, is indifferent to how the daemon is invoked.

Now I'll let you in on a secret.  The internal machinery to set no-reconfigure
at runtime already exists; I had to build it it in order to stop gpsctl from 
heedlessly stomping on GPS settings.  There's an .enable_reconfigure flag
in the session-context structure; gpsd sets it, gpsctl doesn't.  It controls
whether the configurator method is called at device-open and driver-switch 
time.

I haven't exposed this flag yet for a couple of reasons:  

One, I think its granularity is wrong -- you probably want to be able
to set it by device type, so you can specifically say &quot;don't
reconfigure SiRFs&quot;.

Two, adding a config file is a big step and not one to be taken casually.
I'm not going to do it without thinking through the syntax and semantics
*extremely* carefully.  Design and processing of language-like markups
is my thing, I'm confident I can come up with an excellent design -- but
not if I rush into it.

Three, like a command-line option, a config file is an easy out for
lazy programmers.  As I pointed out to Chris Kuethe some time back, 
no-reconfigure just addresses a symptom -- the truly right thing
would be to have gpsd store its config changes and revert them on
exit.  But the second I implement a runtime no-reconfigure, the
pressure to implement the *right* design goes away.

I've long refused to reintroduce a device-type or speed switch to the
daemon for exactly the same reason -- I don't want us to have an easy
out from making the packet-sniffer and hunt loop work correctly.

So.  Please go figure out why your GPS is laggy in SiRF mode, or bug SiRF
technical support until you get an answer.  That's what you *really*
need to know.  Solve the problem, don't just evade it!
