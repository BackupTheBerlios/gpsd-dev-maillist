<PRE>Chris, the query in gpsd.php had a problem you need to be aware of if you ever 
write another special-purpose client.  (Copied to dev for the record; other
people might run into similar problems.)

You were using the old-style queries, specifically SPAMQY.  While these
are OK to use with J=1 if you're polling repeatedly, it's a dicey way
to go if you're doing a single-shot query.  Even repeating it a few
times won't necessarily work.

The problem is that your queries are in a race with the daemon's logic for 
assigning and initializing a GPS.  It won't try to assign a GPS to your
channel until the first command that demands actual device information,
the S in this case.  

Then the race begins. The daemon will be interleaving reads of whatever
packet fragments the GPS is shipping with reads from your client
socket.  It is entirely possible that the rest of your commands
will get processed before the daemon reads and processes enough GPS 
sentences to get a fix -- especially if the serial device is 
slow and the GPS has a long initialization sequence.

I've fixed this in gpsd.php by having it set watcher mode and
read a couple of O responses before issuing SPAMQY.  That way
the daemon paces the action, actually telling the PHP when it
receives packets.  By the time SPAMQY is issued there is certain
to be data, if the GPS is reporting any at all.

To be certain of having full fix data, you'd need to wait for as many O
responses as there are sentences that set fix data in the device's
normal cycle.  For SiRFs, one read will do because normally only one
sentence in the cycle ships fix data.  For NMEA devices you don't have
a full fix before five reads, enough for an entire
GPRMC/GPGGA/GPVTG/GPGLL/GPGSV cycle in whatever permutation the device
ships it.

In practice, three O reads will always be enough to get you *some* fix
information -- worst case is your first O came from a GPGSA and all
you get is a mode, and then you get GPVTG, but you'll always get lat/lon 
on the next O.

As I said, clients that poll SPAMQY repleatedly won't have a problem;
the race effects will show up but be limited to noise in the first
few seconds of samples.
