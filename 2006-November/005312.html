<PRE>Mick Durkin &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">mick.durkin at saunalahti.fi</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> So this is a case where we are allowed to jump out of the for() loop because 
</I>&gt;<i> we got a result before finishing? I wouldn't have proposed that because of 
</I>&gt;<i> all the dire warnings about the evil &quot;goto&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realise there is a place for the construct (as mentioned by the Great 
</I>&gt;<i> Prophets K&amp;R), but my nuts are not large enough to suggest using it yet!
</I>
I've been writing C code for 24 years, which means that while there
are people more expert in the language out there, you would have to
work fairly hard to find them.  My nuts are more than large enough to
use a goto when appropriate. :-)

The taboo against goto arose in an earlier age, one I myself am just
barely old enough to remember.  At that time, in the late 1960s,
programming and programming language design were both crude and
primitive arts.  Programmers tended to think in assembler even when
they weren't writing in it; they wrote huge ugly impenetrable blocks
of code laced with forward and backward gotos.

Edsger Dijkstra noticed this was a bad idea. In 1968 he wrote a paper called
&quot;Go To Considered harmful&quot;.  You can read it here:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/">http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/</A>&gt;.  And you should, it's a classic.
 
Bear in mind as you read that we hadn't really figured out
modularization yet; Unix itself wasn't invented until a year later,
and much of the discipline today's programmers absorb through their
pores about writing programs as loosely-coupled small subroutines
had not yet evolved.

Dijkstra advocated the banning of gotos as a way to force programmers
to write in a more comprehensible way.  This was a worthy proposal,
which programmers of a certain age (including myself and Gary Miller)
received as wisdom in the 1970s and came to obey religiously, if only
because it allowed us to feel a bit superior to our unenlightened
forebears.

But the last sentence of Dijkstra's paper contains an important
qualification: &quot;The exercise to translate an arbitrary flow diagram
more or less mechanically into a jump-less one, however, is not to be
recommended. Then the resulting flow diagram cannot be expected to be
more transparent than the original one.&quot;

In other words, Dijkstra himself admits there are times when the
structured, &quot;jumpless&quot; version of a program is harder to read than the
version with goto statements in it.  When that happens, the taboo
against gotos has become harmful rather than helpful.

The mavens of modern C style (which includes me, in a minor way) have
broadly agreed on a set of heuristics for when goto is appropriate,
and which are less restrictive than Dijkstra's taboo.  Here they are.

1. The goto backward is always forbidden.  It's just too confusing,
and situations where you might think you need it are better handled with
a looping construct or setjmp/longjmp.  

2. gotos that could be trivially expressed in more structured ways,
e.g., by a return statement or a while or for loop, are also always
forbidden.

3. The goto forward is permitted under specific circumstances, only
when the code with goto is easier to read than the version without it.

4. As a general rule, *never* code a goto forward if the target is more
than about 20 lines down; otherwise you lose the property that the 
goto and its target can be seen and understood as a unit even in a 
small editing window.

5. For gotos of less than 20 lines span, the evilness of the goto is 
inversely proportional to span length.  A goto that skips one or two
lines may be considered harmless; one that skips ten lines should
be viewed with deep suspicion.

6. A good sign that you *should* use a goto is when you find yourself
certing lots of silly flag variables and if-statements for which the
only purpose is to terminate a loop construct or switch-based state
machine.

7. Breaking out of deeply-nested loops is one circumstance in which the
goto is permitted.  (This is undoubtedly the most common one.)

8. The code pattern that would be expressed by a Python for/else is
another circumstance in which the goto is permitted.  That is, if
you want to execute a code snippet only if the loop terminates
normally, it is permitted for the inner loop code to goto a target
just past the snippet.  But see rules 4 and 5 on the snippet length.

9. Jumping forward across cases in a switch/case block is permitted,
and may be good style in certain hand-coded implementations of
deterministic finite-state automata.

10. Remember the meta-rule: use goto only when it *increases* the
clarity and concision of the program.
