You don't _have_ to scroll to see 12 channels. You can resize the main window 
vertically and/or collapse the &quot;Raw GPSD Data&quot; and/or use a smaller font (via 
the Gtk2 resource file) for the satellite table. That ought to be enough 
options to keep most people happy, no?

&gt;<i> The old one displays more information using less real estate.
</I>
Arguable, depending on what data you're interested in. You like the satellite 
list. I like seeing more (and pause-able) GPSD data. Putting the satellite 
list (which is less needed, IMHO, now that I display the exact signal:noise 
ratio in the graphical satellite display) on a 2nd tab while expanding the 
GPSD data area seemed like a good compromise to me -- we each have all the 
data we ever had in the old app (and more); yours is just 1 click away.

Without trying to sound glib, if you really like the old one, you'll be able 
to keep using it, since ESR has stated that this new app cannot replace the 
&quot;agnostic&quot; old app, although you'll have to continue to deal with Motif, 
something which doesn't bother me at all, incidentally.

If you have some specific recommendations, I'm &quot;all ears&quot;.

&gt;<i> Thanks for doing this.
</I>
You're welcome. :^)

&gt;<i> You just don't know how much the Motif dependency is 
</I>&gt;<i> bugging me.
</I>
Not enough to have written your own Gtk or Qt or WxWidgets or FLTK client, I'm 
guessing. ;^)

P.S. Sorry for the delayed reply. Your email arrived 1 day after you sent it!

Regards,
Bill Marr
