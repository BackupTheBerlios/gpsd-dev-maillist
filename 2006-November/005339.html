<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt;The goal, as you probably conjectured, is to make adding new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;regression tests less of a pain in the tuchus. To that end, I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;decided I don't want to maintain two packet sniffers (one in C and one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;in Python) anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;So I'm going to disentangle the C packet sniffer from the rest of the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and figure out some way to glue it into gpsfake.  This patch is the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(and most difficult) step in the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And since the C sniffer is the one that gets way more use, we may as
</I>&gt;<i> well try reuse it (python bindings) ... right?
</I>
Exactly.  Equally to the point, we want to be *certain* that gpsfake 
is packetizing data streams the same way the daemon would.  Best way
to guarantee that is to have them use the same sniffer mode.

&gt;<i> Indeed, adding protocols to gpsfake is a pain. I think you might want
</I>&gt;<i> to revisit the format. For my local playback engine, i just have
</I>&gt;<i> (optionally) timestamped hexdumps.
</I>
Hmmm...that's not a bad idea.  Let's revisit that after 2.34 ships.
I don't want to use hex for NMEA variants, losing the readability 
would be sad, but a little conditional logic would take care of that.

&gt;<i>                  It's protocol-independent and
</I>&gt;<i> allows me to preserve timing characteristics (if necessary, which so
</I>&gt;<i> far it isn't). 
</I>
Agreed, so far it isn't.  But I like the idea of preserving that info, if
possible.

&gt;<i> &gt;Yeah?  Show me the script :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> script sent via private mail. anyone else who wants a copy can have
</I>&gt;<i> one, it's just a bunch of nested loops to set up the --enable and
</I>&gt;<i> --disable flags...
</I>
Got it.  Haven't run it yet, but I will.  I'll probably polish it a bit
and put it in the repo, too.  Good tool for developers to have handy.

&gt;<i>                             This'll get right painful when we get
</I>&gt;<i> up to 13 or 14 drivers and that's looking like a very real possibility
</I>&gt;<i> in the near term.
</I>
2^n combinatorial explosions are indeed a bitch that way, yes.

&gt;<i> &gt;I hope figuring out why the TSIP driver seems to start ignoring the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;stuff gpsfake throws at it is on the list somewhere.  And if you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;determine that instead it's gpsfake that is somehow screwing up, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;would be useful too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Knee-jerk reaction, it's gpsfake - this doesn't happen reading from a
</I>&gt;<i> fifo or a real gps. Knee-jerk reaction, it's the daemon. it's job is
</I>&gt;<i> to process packets, and quite frankly, it ain't.
</I>
I'm wondering vaguely about timing problems in gpsfake's internal threading.
 
&gt;<i> Are we sure that gpsfake isn't subtly corrupting things
</I>&gt;<i> (byte-stuffing?). Is the tty being naughty?
</I>
I'm not certain of either of these.  To be investigated.  Actually, since
it's up to Gary to fix the Garmin stuff, I'd say this is priority one for
you and me.
 
&gt;<i> How badly do you want 100% test coverage prior to release?
</I>
It would be nice, but if Gary gets the Garmin stuff working I have
enough confidence in the code as it is to ship it.

I do want us to get the Trimble regression tests right, though, and that
meanst fixing the no-see-Trimble-packets problem,
