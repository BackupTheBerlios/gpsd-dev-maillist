<PRE>Hi Eric,

&gt;<i> I've been writing C code for 24 years, which means that while there
</I>&gt;<i> are people more expert in the language out there, you would have to
</I>&gt;<i> work fairly hard to find them.  My nuts are more than large enough to
</I>&gt;<i> use a goto when appropriate. :-)
</I>
I have been programming in C for almost as long (20 years).

&gt;<i> Edsger Dijkstra noticed this was a bad idea. In 1968 he wrote a paper called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Go To Considered harmful&quot;.  You can read it here:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/">http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/</A>&gt;.  And you should, it's a classic.
</I>
I seem to recall that he wrote a followup article on this as well, but
I can't remember.

&gt;<i> The mavens of modern C style (which includes me, in a minor way) have
</I>&gt;<i> broadly agreed on a set of heuristics for when goto is appropriate,
</I>&gt;<i> and which are less restrictive than Dijkstra's taboo.  Here they are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The goto backward is always forbidden.  It's just too confusing,
</I>&gt;<i> and situations where you might think you need it are better handled with
</I>&gt;<i> a looping construct or setjmp/longjmp.
</I>
The one exception to all of these rules is when you're writing
performance code. I recall writing a state-machine based decompressor
(for G4 fax compression). I got the code all working properly with no
gotos. In the profiling stages, I discovered that the &quot;structured
code&quot; overhead was significant, so I changed the design to use gotos,
and managed to get a 15% improvement. This was mostly because I could
goto the next state.

Obviously, this was a core algorithim, and 90% of the code in any
given program is typically not performance sensitive.

&gt;<i> 3. The goto forward is permitted under specific circumstances, only
</I>&gt;<i> when the code with goto is easier to read than the version without it.
</I>
The place that I like the forward goto is going to a a cleanup label,
which is an exit from the function. This is espcially usefull when you
need to release allocated memoy, close files etc and there are lots of
error checks.

A typical template looks like this:

void foo( args)
{
    void *mem = NULL;
    FILE *fs = NULL;
    int rc;

    if (( mem = malloc( somesize )) == NULL )
    {
        rc = ENOMEM;
        goto cleanup;
    }
    if (( fs = fopen( &quot;SomeFile&quot;, &quot;r&quot; )) == NULL )
    {
        .. report error..
        rc = errno;
        goto cleanup;
    }
    ....
    Read file
    if ( error )
    {
        set rc
        goto cleanp;
    }


    // Since we got this far, everything was successful

    rc = 0;

cleanup:
    if ( mem != NULL )
        free( mem );
    if ( fs != NULL )
        fclose( fs );

    return rc;
}
