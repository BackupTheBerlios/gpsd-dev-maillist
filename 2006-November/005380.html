<PRE>Hello Eric,
I noticed you successfully fixed the missing probing of the gps devices,
so my garmin is working again (yay!).
I used gpsdrive as a test application and stumbled across two things:
- error estimates are not shown
- satellite SNR seems to be wrong

I followed your advice to dig into the code and for the first problem I
figured out the following. gpsdrive seems to use a raw mode of gpsd,
requesting it by 'R'. I'm new to gpsd, so I don't know yet in which ways
applications can fetch the data, but that's my interpretation of what
gpsdrive does.

For Garmin driver this means that the binary data has to be translated
into NMEA sentences for gpsdrive, and at that point error estimates are
dropped.
The garmin.c code states that there is no pdop,hdop,vdop that seems to
be used in gpsd_binary_quality_dump() to build a GPGSA sentence, but
instead the garmin unit delivers eph,epv,epe which should be translated
back to a PGRME sentence in that same function.

This does not happen, because in libgpsd_core.c, gpsd_binary_dump(),
the function gpsd_binary_quality_dump() is only called if HDOP_SET is
set, which is not for Garmin. Instead ERR_SET is set, which is not
tested.

To get my PGRME sentence (and only that) I splitted the
gpsd_binary_quality_dump() into two functions, one which makes a GPGSA
sentence if HDOP_SET is set, and one which builds only the Garmin PGRME
sentence if ERR_SET is set.

After that, I got the EPE error estimate in gpsdrive (yay! #2).

After I found that, I noticed that the epe,epv,eph values in the built
PGRME sentence differed a bit from those of the garmin binary packet.
The reason:
garmin.c does the following calculation in PrintSERPacket():

	// Estimated position error in meters.
	session-&gt;gpsdata.epe = pvt-&gt;epe * (GPSD_CONFIDENCE/2);
	session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.eph = pvt-&gt;eph * (GPSD_CONFIDENCE/2);
	session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.epv = pvt-&gt;epv * (GPSD_CONFIDENCE/2);

while gpsd_binary_quality_dump() translates back with CEP50_SIGMA (1.18)
instead of 2. I guess the 2 comes from Garmin's interface spec (pdf)
which mentions &quot;2 sigma (meters)&quot; as epe unit. The pdf however does not
elaborate on that unit any further so that assumption is wrong here and
it would be better to use CEP50_SIGMA here also.

The svn diffs of my hacking adventure is attached, please have a look at
it.

To solve the second problem of apparently wrong satellite SNR display I
first need to figure out which units are used in both representations -
maybe even gpsdrive is wrong here...

Regards,
Daniel Dorau
