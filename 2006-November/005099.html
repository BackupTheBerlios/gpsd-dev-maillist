Yo Eric!

That would work for me.

</I>
Seems like too much work, but don't let me stop you.

If the man pages are on the SVN, then the person that updates the .xml
should create the man pages if only to check his work.  Then the
next commit gets the SVN up to date.

Still, I would easily give up the man pages in SVN to get them in
the tarball.  Just as we expect devs to take the extra steps in the
autoconfuse we can expect them to work around the man page thing.

&gt;<i> I'm arguing with you, but I'm still listening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And what of the 100++ other distros you do not maintain and those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that download the master tarball?  Those people all suffer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having to install xsltproc is suffering?  Sorry, I don't buy it.
</I>
It is the not knowing WHY your make filed that is suffering.  As we
have recently heard from several folks that could not figure it out on
their own.  I know of no other project that imposes this contraint
and folks just are not figuring it out on their own.  As always the
best surprise is no surprise, and this is a big surprise to the
average tarball user.

&gt;<i> I truly don't see that as a significant cost.  Perhaps your argument
</I>&gt;<i> would be better advanced if you could explain why it is.
</I>
I hate it when I start to install a simple package and find it depends
on a bunch of weird stuff I never heard about.  I know a lot of folks
just give up when the make first fails.

&gt;<i> &gt; There is a unique ebuild (or more) for every master version.  That is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot of ebuilds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Educate me, please.  What's a &quot;master version&quot; in this context?
</I>
gpsd 2.33, and gpsd 2.32, as released my the current developer would
be the master in this context.  Every time you bump the gpsd version
their must be a new ebuild.

&gt;<i> &gt; Then I guess I have to speak up for all of us in the noise.  The 50%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the UNIX market that is not the top three is NOT noise.  Why do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you not then consider the embedded folks noise?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because they're smart enough to install xsltproc once when they need it.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not believe this is actually a problem for techies.
</I>
My data, culeld from #gpsd and gpsd-users should trump your belief.

&gt;<i> Which means, basically, that if you talk about embedded folks and your
</I>&gt;<i> Macintosh configure monkeys in the same paragraph, I'm going to consider
</I>&gt;<i> that evidence that *your* thinking is muddled rather than that mine is.
</I>
I consider them additive.  2 reasons to almost need something should
add up to a good reason to need.

&gt;<i> &gt; Time and time again UNIX shoots itself in the foot by being devisive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather than inclusive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, build-time package dependencies are not divisiveness, and you are
</I>&gt;<i> not going to persuade me otherwise on *that*.
</I>
I love xsltproc, but it is not mainstream.  requiring it to build a simple
daemon if deviding out those that do not install the kitchen sink in their
sev systems.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I haven't actually seen any of those complaints.  But I'm going to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hanging out on #gpsd, so perhaps I will.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And how many complaints/month before you change your mind?  How many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; man page changes per month were you seeing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've had two false alarms about this because I misunderstood a commit
</I>&gt;<i> mesage.  I don't want to have another one.  I don't even want to have
</I>&gt;<i> to *think* about this class of SNAFU, let alone cope with it.
</I>
We have had more than two confused users in the last week because of this.
All to save two confused messages over the last few years?  Does not
the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?
