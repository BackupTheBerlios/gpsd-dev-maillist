<PRE>Guys,

I am not sure if I misunderstand things, but I noticed that my driver no 
longer gets asked to probe for its device at start up when running SVN 3959. 
I as a sanity check, I enabled the Garmin driver which I know also has a 
probe facility and this also doesn't respond.

I traced the code and it seems the mod to gpsd.c in SVN 3934 changed things. I 
confirmed this by backing out the change; I swapped gpsd_open() back to 
gpsd_activate(). This call has an additional parameter now, but that was the 
only other change needed. After that, the probes reappeared.

Here is a snapshot of a session with the code on SVN 3959:-

[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">root at linuxbox</A> trunk]# gpsd -n -N -D3 /dev/ttyS0
gpsd: launching (Version 2.34)
gpsd: listening on port gpsd
gpsd: shmat(0,0,0) succeeded
gpsd: shmat(0,0,0) succeeded
gpsd: shmat(0,0,0) succeeded
gpsd: shmat(0,0,0) succeeded
gpsd: running with effective group ID 0
gpsd: running with effective user ID 0
gpsd: opening GPS data source at '/dev/ttyS0'
gpsd: speed 9600, 8N1

The program waits, but nothing happens as the connected GPS device is silent 
unless probed. I stopped it after a few seconds.

gpsd: closing GPS=/dev/ttyS0 (4)
gpsd: Received terminating signal 2. Exiting...
[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">root at linuxbox</A> trunk]#



=========================================

Here is the same command when the 3959 code is backed out:-

[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">root at linuxbox</A> trunk]# gpsd -n -N -D3 /dev/ttyS0
gpsd: launching (Version 2.34)
gpsd: listening on port gpsd
gpsd: shmat(0,0,0) succeeded
gpsd: shmat(0,0,0) succeeded
gpsd: shmat(0,0,0) succeeded
gpsd: shmat(0,0,0) succeeded
gpsd: running with effective group ID 0
gpsd: running with effective user ID 0
gpsd: opening GPS data source at '/dev/ttyS0'
gpsd: speed 9600, 8N1
gpsd: garmin_gps not active.
gpsd: jupiter_t_probe_detect: Probing for a Jupiter-T device
.
.
&lt;snipped&gt;

In this case, the device gets probed and comes to life. Notice also that in 
this case the garmin device is also probed for (of course it isn't there on 
my machine).

I have effected a fix, but I am not sure of what was the desired consequence 
of the change I removed. Could anyone tell me if I have found a bug or have I 
omitted some changes to my driver?

I assumed that I hadn't missed something, since the garmin drive didn't probe 
and that is part of the supported codebase, but I am prepared to be shot 
down.

Best Regards

Mick
