A legend is easy. I think I'll add it to the webpage, rather than the
graphic. Still, I feel my UI is a bit of a failure if I have to
include a legend.

or hopelessly brain-damaged in *precisely the same way* ... much like
Gary, Eric and I on the topic of what to do with carrier phase
measurements.

&gt;<i> And I'd still argue that my green/grey coloring to indicate &quot;part of nav

</I>&gt;<i> basically, so far, you haven't convinced me to change it. Maybe you and Eric
</I>&gt;<i> (and Gary whenever he joins in) can gang up on me and twist my arm. ;^)
</I>
No more and no less to someone other than yourself. Hollow or filled
makes more sense to me which is why I used it. Green and grey made
more sense to you which is why you used it.

&gt;<i> How precisely do you need to visualize it? Aren't the &quot;N,S,E,W&quot; markers
</I>&gt;<i> enough? Not arguing, just curious.
</I>
I'm not asking for you to draw a protractor. I think 22.5 degrees (the
difference between SW and SSW) is as much resolution as is necessary.
I just find I &quot;get it&quot; a little sooner with a bit more of a grid
there.

&gt;<i> &gt; I wasn't thinking of a binary &quot;has grid/no grid&quot; as &quot;how much grid can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we comfortably and meaningfully fit?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I might be convinced to try that. But I abhor clutter, especially if I'm
</I>&gt;<i> convinced that it adds little functionality. I'll look into implementing this
</I>&gt;<i> with your suggestion in mind.
</I>
Here's what happens if you shrink my graphic
<A HREF="http://gpsd.mainframe.cx/?host=gpsd.mainframe.cx&amp;port=2947&amp;op=view">http://gpsd.mainframe.cx/?host=gpsd.mainframe.cx&amp;port=2947&amp;op=view</A>
<A HREF="http://gpsd.mainframe.cx/?host=gpsd.mainframe.cx&amp;port=2947&amp;op=view&amp;sz=small">http://gpsd.mainframe.cx/?host=gpsd.mainframe.cx&amp;port=2947&amp;op=view&amp;sz=small</A>

It does get pretty squishy. I haven't got the fonts right for the small case.

&gt;<i> &gt; I suspect our wives are going to be heavily involved in the &quot;honey,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what does this picture say to you&quot; testing process...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But since women are statistically much less likely to be color-blind, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> they're not the best choice to survey when discussing color-related issues?
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe it's just the opposite? :^)
</I>
I was thinking of the MCO perspective. Mine usually smiles and nods
when I start on the gps babbling... she's happy that I'm happy and
that I'm sharing something I enjoy doing, but it's not her cup of tea.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
