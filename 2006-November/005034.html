<PRE>Jon Schlueter &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">jon.schlueter at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Not sure what that block actually does... I think it ends up tying
</I>&gt;<i> back to my adSense account.  So I would recommend gpsd get their own
</I>&gt;<i> account and generate a new code block for general useage, but you
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to check funcationality to see if it actually does what
</I>&gt;<i> is expected with the snippit I posted.
</I>&gt;<i> AdSense doesn't cost to setup/use and you can just use it for the
</I>&gt;<i> search.  which would provide the functionality, but might provide
</I>&gt;<i> money for a piece of hardware every year or so...
</I>
Now the interesting news is that the earch code works fine with those
mystery bits removed.  This doesn't surprise me; all it's doing is
generating the same sort of GET query your browser ships when you do
a search with Google's own form.

(I actually grok forms, CGI, and related stuff pretty thoroughly -- if
I weren't much happier as a programmer, I could be a more than
competent web designer.  I asked you for a code snippet to save time,
not because I couldn't write such a form myself.)

So I suspect you are correct about those mystery bits identifying you
to the AdSence database (in fac, that was my guess before you
mentioned it), but they're not at all necessary for our purposes.

I'll just swipe the form design and leave whether we sign up for
AdSense as a separate decision.
