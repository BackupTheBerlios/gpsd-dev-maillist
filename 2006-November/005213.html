<PRE>Marr &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">marr99 at highstream.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I disagree. And I don't see how those two goals require
</I>&gt;<i> compromise. My circles are both visible and representative of the
</I>&gt;<i> actual sky geometry. 
</I>
Theoretically, yes.

&gt;<i>                        The center of the circle represents the
</I>&gt;<i> position of the satellite, regardless of the size of the circle.
</I>
Yes -- but the larger the circle is, the more difficult I find it to grasp
the relationships and mentally transform the picture to what I might
see if I looked up at the sky and the satellites were visible.

&gt;<i>       If you're arguing simply based on aesthetics, I'd listen and 
</I>&gt;<i> be inclined to go with the consensus. But if you're suggesting somehow that 
</I>&gt;<i> my large circles don't represent actual sky geometry, then we'll have to 
</I>&gt;<i> argue some more, because that's just not true!
</I>
Mathematically, you're correct (says the ex-mathematician).  Neurologically, 
you're not -- at least, *my* spatial intuition was having real trouble getting
any traction from those screen shots.  

And...sorry, this isn't something I'd normally bring up, but I've
scored in the top 1% of geometric and kinematic-visualization ability
each of the three or four times I've been tested.  If I'm having trouble,
the other 99% of the population will have more.

I'm looking at the screenshots again, and I think I understand what's missing.
The circles need, at minimum, a center mark or crosshairs.  Without that, the
visual clutter from the enclosed text makes it effortful for me to locate 
the center of each.  Only after I've done that can I build the wireframe-like
thing in my head that represents their spatial relationships.

How about a compromise...could you add a colored center dot, space the text so
it's not stepped on, and then thin-wall the circle in gray so it's still
a boundary on the text but easier to ignore?

I think that might capture both sets of advantages.
