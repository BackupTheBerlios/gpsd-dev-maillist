<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I have taught a lot of monkeys to &quot;configure;make; make install&quot;.  Actually
</I>&gt;<i> getting people to read configure output is a much harder task.  Notice that
</I>&gt;<i> mags like Linux Journal have been harping on this for a while: &quot;You do
</I>&gt;<i> not have to be a techie to &quot;configure;make;make install&quot;.
</I>
Hmmm.  That's the most persuasive thing you've said yet, actually.

My view of the matter depended on the assumption than anybody running
configure is someone we don't have to mollycoddle.  If that's not
true, I have to rethink.

&gt;<i> &gt;In general, you're mixing arguments from convenience to users with arguments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;about what techies might have to do in odd edge cases in a way that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;make any sense to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is because what you are doing is so wrong on so many
</I>&gt;<i> levels. Consider the sum total of all the goodness in all the arguments
</I>&gt;<i> to all possible users versus the one-time hit to on developer of putting
</I>&gt;<i> the man pages back in the SVN.
</I>
There're *not* going back in the SVN.  That's final.  They're not
master documents, so they don't belong in the repo.

You might convince me to put them back in the distribution tarball,
which would address your configure-monkey case.

If you're *really* effective, you might persuade me to write a
server-side hook script on svn.berlios.de that regenerates them for
automatic inclusion in checkouts.  Yes, Subversion can do that, the
commit-watch messages are generated with the same hook; and yes, the
Berlios folks have xsltproc installed.  I just checked.

I'm arguing with you, but I'm still listening.

&gt;<i> And what of the 100++ other distros you do not maintain and those
</I>&gt;<i> that download the master tarball?  Those people all suffer.
</I>
Having to install xsltproc is suffering?  Sorry, I don't buy it.
I truly don't see that as a significant cost.  Perhaps your argument
would be better advanced if you could explain why it is.

&gt;<i> There is a unique ebuild (or more) for every master version.  That is
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of ebuilds.
</I>
Educate me, please.  What's a &quot;master version&quot; in this context?
 
&gt;<i> Then I guess I have to speak up for all of us in the noise.  The 50%
</I>&gt;<i> of the UNIX market that is not the top three is NOT noise.  Why do
</I>&gt;<i> you not then consider the embedded folks noise?
</I>
Because they're smart enough to install xsltproc once when they need it.
I do not believe this is actually a problem for techies.  To make your case
for shipping man pages, you need to either (a) explain to me why that
belief is incorrect, or (b) make an argument from the needs of 
end users that is *not* confused with odd techie edge cases.

Which means, basically, that if you talk about embedded folks and your
Macintosh configure monkeys in the same paragraph, I'm going to consider
that evidence that *your* thinking is muddled rather than that mine is.
 
&gt;<i> Time and time again UNIX shoots itself in the foot by being devisive
</I>&gt;<i> rather than inclusive.
</I>
Sorry, build-time package dependencies are not divisiveness, and you are
not going to persuade me otherwise on *that*.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't actually seen any of those complaints.  But I'm going to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hanging out on #gpsd, so perhaps I will.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And how many complaints/month before you change your mind?  How many
</I>&gt;<i> man page changes per month were you seeing?
</I>
I've had two false alarms about this because I misunderstood a commit
mesage.  I don't want to have another one.  I don't even want to have
to *think* about this class of SNAFU, let alone cope with it.
