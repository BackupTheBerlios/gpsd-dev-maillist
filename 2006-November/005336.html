And since the C sniffer is the one that gets way more use, we may as
well try reuse it (python bindings) ... right?

Indeed, adding protocols to gpsfake is a pain. I think you might want
to revisit the format. For my local playback engine, i just have
(optionally) timestamped hexdumps. It's protocol-independent and
allows me to preserve timing characteristics (if necessary, which so
far it isn't). You can put plaintext metadata in # comments, but
unless you're implementing a conversation protocol (like garmin) you
can just spew packets at some fraction/multiple of realtime speed.

&gt;<i> &gt; And are you going to compile with all possible driver combinations? it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't take that long, especially if you script it. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah?  Show me the script :-).
</I>
script sent via private mail. anyone else who wants a copy can have
one, it's just a bunch of nested loops to set up the --enable and
--disable flags...

585 builds in 4hr on my 1.8GHz pentium4 laptop. use of a ramdisk
doesn't help much - i've got a pretty big cache on my disk, my
filesystem cache is turn up as well, and the filesystem is mounted
asynchronous, so there's not a lot of cause to beat up on the disk. so
it'll take probably 16hr to test all 11 supported drivers (italk/itrax
aren't supported drivers yet).  This'll get right painful when we get
up to 13 or 14 drivers and that's looking like a very real possibility
in the near term.

&gt;<i> &gt; Hah! 3 hours west of you means I'm still awake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose so.  Reckoned without hacker scheduling, I did.  Do you have
</I>&gt;<i> any particular time preference?
</I>
It's never a good time to break anything. It's always a good time to
fix something properly.

&gt;<i> &gt; I've got other fluff to work on.
</I>&gt;<i> I hope figuring out why the TSIP driver seems to start ignoring the
</I>&gt;<i> stuff gpsfake throws at it is on the list somewhere.  And if you can
</I>&gt;<i> determine that instead it's gpsfake that is somehow screwing up, that
</I>&gt;<i> would be useful too.
</I>
Knee-jerk reaction, it's gpsfake - this doesn't happen reading from a
fifo or a real gps. Knee-jerk reaction, it's the daemon. it's job is
to process packets, and quite frankly, it ain't.

Are we sure that gpsfake isn't subtly corrupting things
(byte-stuffing?). Is the tty being naughty?

&gt;<i> We've *got* to have a regression-test infrastructure that's sound,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if we're going to start adding new drivers like crazy after
</I>&gt;<i> 2.34.
</I>
Indeed. I now have a prototype framework to compile with every
combination of every supported driver. And by noon tomorrow, I should
have a test log that proves that r4029 compiles with any combination
of drivers.

Then we get to make sure I can &quot;make regress&quot; and get $? == 0 if all
went well. Then speed it up. With 15 drivers, it'll take me a week of
uninterruped builds in a ramdisk to just compile test everything to
say nothing of actually running 8200 passes through the regression
suite.

How badly do you want 100% test coverage prior to release?

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
