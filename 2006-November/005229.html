</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's 1 screenshot of the old Motif app (for reference) and 4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; screenshots of my new Gtk2 app -- enjoy!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Overall I like what you have done, but I think the 'information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; density' went down too much. It would be great if all 12 channels could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be listed without scrolling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You don't _have_ to scroll to see 12 channels. You can resize the main
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window vertically and/or collapse the &quot;Raw GPSD Data&quot; and/or use a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; smaller font (via the Gtk2 resource file) for the satellite table. That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ought to be enough options to keep most people happy, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take 'information density' as 'number of unique data items per square
</I>&gt;<i> inch'.
</I>
There is no duplication of information on the main display, as it comes up by 
default, so I don't understand your comment/complaint. All the data is unique 
and it's presented as densely as I can while still retaining flexibility 
(adapting to window resizing, font changes, etc).

&gt;<i> I don't like too much eye candy in relation to information provided. 
</I>
I don't understand your &quot;eye candy&quot; reference. Tell me something _specific_ 
that you feel is superfluous.

BTW, did you read my detailed design explanation/justification or just look at 
the screen shots? I suspect the latter, given some of your comments.

&gt;<i> I like smaller sats with just the prn better than having information put in
</I>&gt;<i> two places.
</I>
OK, good. That's the 1st _legitimate_ complaint I've heard you make. Your vote 
for smaller satellites puts you in the Eric/Chris column, I believe. I've 
addressed this issue in another email.

As far as &quot;having information put in two places&quot;, that only applies to data in 
the satellite table, which is (intentionally) hidden away in the 2nd tab by 
default, so I still don't understand your concern in that regard.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The old one displays more information using less real estate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Arguable, depending on what data you're interested in. You like the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; satellite list. I like seeing more (and pause-able) GPSD data. Putting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the satellite list (which is less needed, IMHO, now that I display the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exact signal:noise ratio in the graphical satellite display) on a 2nd tab
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while expanding the GPSD data area seemed like a good compromise to me --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we each have all the data we ever had in the old app (and more); yours is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just 1 click away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing to argue here.
</I>
Yes, there most certainly is.

&gt;<i> The old app put the same amount of information 
</I>&gt;<i> into less screen real estate.
</I>
No it did not. &quot;Less screen real estate&quot;, yes, but only slightly (31x54 pixels 
[WxH] less, in fact). &quot;Same amount of information&quot;, no!

The old application displays a single (often truncated, with no way to view 
the tail, in fact, without resizing the main window) line of GPSD data. Mine 
displays over 7 lines of data at once (and it can be paused, and long lines 
can be viewed without resizing the main window, and it can store any 
reasonable number of 'history' lines [12 ATM, but that's arbitrary], FWIW).

My app shows whether the 'jitter' (or 'De-Jitter' as I refer to it) option is 
selected by putting the control right out there in the open. The old app does 
not. That's &quot;information&quot;.

Furthermore, there is _nothing_ in that (hidden) 2nd tab of satellite data 
that cannot be discerned from the always-present, enlarge-able graphical 
satellite display.

&gt;<i> Your suggestion of resizing the main window to get all 12 sats listed is
</I>&gt;<i> counter productive in this sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Without trying to sound glib, if you really like the old one, you'll be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to keep using it, since ESR has stated that this new app cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replace the &quot;agnostic&quot; old app, although you'll have to continue to deal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with Motif, something which doesn't bother me at all, incidentally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right...
</I>
I'm not sure if that's sarcasm or not. I was serious. If you really like the 
old app, I'd suggest that you continue using it.

I'm happy to listen to specific complaints (or, even better, specific 
suggestions). But saying, basically, &quot;it's not as good as the old one&quot; is not 
helpful.

&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. Sorry for the delayed reply. Your email arrived 1 day after you sent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dns problem on my end. I hope this one goes faster.
</I>
Yes, much better. :^)
