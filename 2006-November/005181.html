Done.

&gt;<i> Hmmm... Not totally. True, I'm not MCO, but I often try to think like one. And
</I>&gt;<i> although I could make intelligent (?) guesses about the satellite display at
</I>&gt;<i> your site (recent image attached), I'm not really seeing how that display is
</I>&gt;<i> any more intuitive (color-wise and satellite icon-wise) than mine.
</I>
Your definition and my definition of MCO may or may not disagree. I
know when I look at an interface and I totally grok what it all
means... now we just need to be sure everyone gets that feeling.

&gt;<i> In my app, I see the '## dB' and it's colored so I _know_ the satellite
</I>&gt;<i> strength and can make a good guess what the red/black color of the text
</I>&gt;<i> means.
</I>
Hm. I totally didn't get the red/black distinction. It went right over
my head and *splat* into the wall behind me. :)

&gt;<i> In your satellite presentation, I suspect that the color of the orb reflects
</I>&gt;<i> the signal strength, but why is PRN #2 bright green when the others are
</I>&gt;<i> darker green? And why do some orbs have a non-filled outline? Is that an
</I>&gt;<i> indication of &quot;part of nav solution&quot;? And why is there an orange-ish,
</I>&gt;<i> non-filled orb (PRN #135)? Is that a WAAS bird? Not trying to &quot;play dumb&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> with this; I just think that it's easy for anyone to consider their design
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;intuitive&quot; and others, well, not so much. :^)
</I>
Playing dumb is good. It makes sense to me, but there are billions and
billions of you out there who aren't me, who can't read my mind...
Anyway, It sounds like you had to think about it. Thats may be a sign
that I need to revise my interface.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [ROT13]
</I>&gt;<i> Coward! ;^)
</I>
Hardly... I just wanted to see if you'd understand why I plotted stuff
the way I did. Now you unstand the concept flopping about in this blob
of porridge I call a brain.

&gt;<i> &gt; Oh, one more: I'd prefer to see more elevation lines, and more azimuth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; radials. But I like that kind of eye candy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a bigger drawing area like yours, I might agree. On the small one in
</I>&gt;<i> 'xgps', I disagree -- too much clutter. Your drawing area is (fixed at)
</I>&gt;<i> 640x640 pixels -- I don't have that luxury.
</I>
But you have the luxury of knowing your screen size at runtime and
being able to redraw accordingly. Where you have lotsa pixels, you can
draw ... 15degree lines... where you don't have so many... 45degree.
Lookee there... you suggested the same thing a couple of paragraphs
down.

&gt;<i> If you really need to know the satellite Azim/Elev precisely, well, that's
</I>&gt;<i> what the table is for and that's why I kept it around.
</I>
It's not so much for the precision as to aid visualization.

&gt;<i> Maybe we should draw azim/elev lines if the main window is resized such that
</I>&gt;<i> the drawing area available for the Satellite Geometry is above some pixel
</I>&gt;<i> threshold? That, I'd consider.
</I>
I wasn't thinking of a binary &quot;has grid/no grid&quot; as &quot;how much grid can
we comfortably and meaningfully fit?&quot;

I suspect our wives are going to be heavily involved in the &quot;honey,
what does this picture say to you&quot; testing process...

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
