About as much as me in this particular case, since I've never used the 
new-in-Gtk2 'list store' capability before this app. (Gtk2 changed a lot of 
things from Gtk1.)

And I'm more of an embedded code guy than a GUI guy, but I cross the line from 
time to time. :^)

I suspect you're right, though. Curiosity may get the best of me and I'll look 
into the Gtk2 thing, but....

&gt;<i> I'm not a 
</I>&gt;<i> fan of leading zeroes ... sometimes I wonder if they're supposed to be
</I>&gt;<i> octal. Is there a compelling reason to use leading zeroes? You are in
</I>&gt;<i> full graphics mode, so you don't have to make stuff line up like in a
</I>&gt;<i> terminal.
</I>
OK, I guess Eric's &quot;don't care&quot; and your argument have effectively convinced 
me. I'll eliminate the leading zeroes.

Now the only issue is... Do we care enough about consistency (both inter-app 
and intra-app in this case) to change the Motif 'xgps' to eliminate leading 
zeroes in the PRN display of the graphical satellite presentation?

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'd prefer to seen &quot;n/a&quot; as &quot;N/A&quot; ... but that's just me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Taken straight from the Motif 'xgps' code. Happy to change to match
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus. I have no strong opinion on this one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I only have a slight bias toward &quot;N/A&quot; ...
</I>
OK, well the easiest thing to do to maintain consistency is.... NOTHING! So I 
guess both Motif and Gtk2 apps will stay as &quot;n/a&quot; for now.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm a little fuzzy on the colour coding. It's not Intuitively Obvious
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To The Most Casual Observer...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wouldn't disagree. But I'm not sure how to make it so (IOTTMCO).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not gonna tell you what it all means - you're a highly technical
</I>&gt;<i> user (ie. not MCO), but does it come a little closer to making sense?
</I>
Hmmm... Not totally. True, I'm not MCO, but I often try to think like one. And 
although I could make intelligent (?) guesses about the satellite display at 
your site (recent image attached), I'm not really seeing how that display is 
any more intuitive (color-wise and satellite icon-wise) than mine. 

In my app, I see the '## dB' and it's colored so I _know_ the satellite 
strength and can make a good guess what the red/black color of the text 
means.

In your satellite presentation, I suspect that the color of the orb reflects 
the signal strength, but why is PRN #2 bright green when the others are 
darker green? And why do some orbs have a non-filled outline? Is that an 
indication of &quot;part of nav solution&quot;? And why is there an orange-ish, 
non-filled orb (PRN #135)? Is that a WAAS bird? Not trying to &quot;play dumb&quot; 
with this; I just think that it's easy for anyone to consider their design 
&quot;intuitive&quot; and others, well, not so much. :^)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you might want to revise your choices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suggestions?

Coward! ;^)

&gt;<i> Oh, one more: I'd prefer to see more elevation lines, and more azimuth
</I>&gt;<i> radials. But I like that kind of eye candy.
</I>
On a bigger drawing area like yours, I might agree. On the small one in 
'xgps', I disagree -- too much clutter. Your drawing area is (fixed at) 
640x640 pixels -- I don't have that luxury.

If you really need to know the satellite Azim/Elev precisely, well, that's 
what the table is for and that's why I kept it around.

Maybe we should draw azim/elev lines if the main window is resized such that 
the drawing area available for the Satellite Geometry is above some pixel 
threshold? That, I'd consider.

Again, thanks for your inputs, Chris!
