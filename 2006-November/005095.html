</I>
I have taught a lot of monkeys to &quot;configure;make; make install&quot;.  Actually
getting people to read configure output is a much harder task.  Notice that
mags like Linux Journal have been harping on this for a while: &quot;You do
not have to be a techie to &quot;configure;make;make install&quot;.


&gt;<i> In general, you're mixing arguments from convenience to users with arguments
</I>&gt;<i> about what techies might have to do in odd edge cases in a way that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> make any sense to me.
</I>
That is because what you are doing is so wrong on so many
levels. Consider the sum total of all the goodness in all the arguments
to all possible users versus the one-time hit to on developer of putting
the man pages back in the SVN.

&gt;<i> &gt;Why is it you feel the need to maintain a zillion packages instead of just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;one good tar?  What possibly could be the win here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ensuring that I never get a patch against generated man markup, for starters.
</I>
Send them to me, or to a FAQ.

&gt;<i> This used to happen to me, and I hated it.  Yes, I'd rather maintain
</I>&gt;<i> a dozen spec files than do this, because that has other benefits.
</I>
And what of the 100++ other distros you do not maintain and those that download
the master tarball?  Those people all suffer.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; That ebuild is still stuck at 2.32 for amd64 so no use to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; How's that?  I don't see any version number mentioned in it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;<A HREF="http://www.gentoo-portage.com/sci-geosciences/gpsd">http://www.gentoo-portage.com/sci-geosciences/gpsd</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;2.32 is current for amd64.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see.  We're talking about different ebuilds.  Addressing that foes
</I>&gt;<i> on my to-do list.
</I>
There is a unique ebuild (or more) for every master version.  That is
a lot of ebuilds.

&gt;<i> &gt;What about the other 100+++ Linux distros?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frankly, I don't care.  Firstly, everything other than Fedora, Debian,
</I>&gt;<i> and Ubuntu is statistical noise.
</I>
Then I guess I have to speak up for all of us in the noise.  The 50%
of the UNIX market that is not the top three is NOT noise.  Why do
you not then consider the embedded folks noise?

Time and time again UNIX shoots itself in the foot by being devisive
rather than inclusive.

&gt;<i> Because it didn't solve *my* problem, which is that I never want to see
</I>&gt;<i> a patch against generated markup ever again.
</I>
I never want to see a bug again either, but wishing it so does not
make it so.

&gt;<i> I haven't actually seen any of those complaints.  But I'm going to be
</I>&gt;<i> hanging out on #gpsd, so perhaps I will.
</I>
And how many complaints/month before you change your mind?  How many
man page changes per month were you seeing?
