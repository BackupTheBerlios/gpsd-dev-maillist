<PRE>  I guess I'm thinking that if we kept all of our bugs and feature 
requests in the berlios bugs system, we could keep track of things like:

1.  Garmin USB bugs
2.  changing cgps 'I' behavior
3.  adding itrax functionality

etc.

  Right now, all of these issues are &quot;tribal knowledge&quot;.  All of us on 
the dev mailing list know (in theory) something about them, and we all 
sort of keep a mental list of what needs to be worked on.  People not on 
the list don't have any real idea.  A formal bugs list would allow us to 
keep things in a place where they won't fall through the cracks, plus it 
would be a place where users could look to see if something is a known 
issue.  If we keep a bugs database and update the notes as we work, it 
would also allow other devs to pick up a problem and continue to work on 
it if/when other devs have to temporarily drop off.  It'll also make 
sure that whatever &quot;mental list&quot; the missing dev might have in his head 
doesn't just disappear until his return (yeah, Gary, that's you ;^)

  We may or may not want to allow the general public to add bugs and/or 
feature requests, it might be wise to filter things through the dev list 
first.  I haven't looked, but presumably the berlios bugs system will 
also allow us to record the rev number where something broke, as well as 
the rev number where it was fixed.  Nice to be able to go back and 
search on past bugs. 

  I guess I'm just used to working this way at work, and by and large, 
it's a benefit to the group projects that I work on.  My main project at 
work has three developers on it, me, a guy in the Bay Area, and another 
in Dublin, Ireland.  The bugs list plus irc keeps us all (somewhat) in 
sync much better than e-mail did.
