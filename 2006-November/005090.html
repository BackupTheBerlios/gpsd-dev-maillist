<PRE>(Sorry to break the threading, but I accidentally deleted Gary's email
and had to grab a copy from the list archive.)

&gt;<i>And how many OS X users know how to use Fink?  Very few in my experience.
</I>
I'm not sure I understand your objection here.  If they're not using fink,
they're installing from a source tarball.  If they're installing from a source 
tarball, they're techies.  If they're techies, the one-time step to install
xsltproc is not a big deal, whether via fink or otherwise.  So where's 
the problem?

In general, you're mixing arguments from convenience to users with arguments 
about what techies might have to do in odd edge cases in a way that doesn't
make any sense to me.

&gt;<i>Why is it you feel the need to maintain a zillion packages instead of just
</I>&gt;<i>one good tar?  What possibly could be the win here?
</I>
Ensuring that I never get a patch against generated man markup, for starters.
This used to happen to me, and I hated it.  Yes, I'd rather maintain 
a dozen spec files than do this, because that has other benefits.  

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; That ebuild is still stuck at 2.32 for amd64 so no use to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How's that?  I don't see any version number mentioned in it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.gentoo-portage.com/sci-geosciences/gpsd">http://www.gentoo-portage.com/sci-geosciences/gpsd</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2.32 is current for amd64.
</I>
I see.  We're talking about different ebuilds.  Addressing that foes
on my to-do list.

&gt;<i>What about the other 100+++ Linux distros?
</I>
Frankly, I don't care.  Firstly, everything other than Fedora, Debian,
and Ubuntu is statistical noise.  Secondly, everything other than Fedora, 
Debian, and Ubuntu is statistical noise used by people who are quite
competent to do a one-time install of xsltproc on their own. after
which they no longer have a problem.

&gt;<i>                                         Why this need to go to all
</I>&gt;<i> this extra work when one simple automated fix solves (and had solved)
</I>&gt;<i> this for everyone?
</I>
Because it didn't solve *my* problem, which is that I never want to see
a patch against generated markup ever again.

&gt;<i>                  Why work so hard to avoid the current, and simple,
</I>&gt;<i> standard practice?  All you need to do is look at the number of user
</I>&gt;<i> complaints on this before and after the change to see this violates
</I>&gt;<i> common user expectations and creates a big continuing support issue.
</I>
I haven't actually seen any of those complaints.  But I'm going to be
hanging out on #gpsd, so perhaps I will.
