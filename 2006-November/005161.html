Yes, I know. The default Gtk2 &quot;renderer&quot; for integers in a 'list store' (like 
the satellite table) does it without leading zeroes, as one might expect. The 
use of leading zeroes in the Satellite Geometry view mimics the existing 
Motif 'xgps' app.

Thanks for bringing this up. It's one of many issues that I had intended to 
resolve before final release. I need to hear what everyone thinks -- should 
it always be with or without leading zeroes in the PRN? I'd (mildly) vote for 
leading zeros everywhere.

&gt;<i> I'd prefer to seen &quot;n/a&quot; as &quot;N/A&quot; ... but that's just me.

Taken straight from the Motif 'xgps' code. Happy to change to match consensus. 
I have no strong opinion on this one.

&gt;<i> The satellite circles feel a little big, but i understand that's a
</I>&gt;<i> side-effect of putting the PRN and signal strength in the circle.
</I>
See my reply to ESR for my thoughts. Again, willing to change to match 
consensus here.

They do look big at the default/initial app size. The effect is lessened when 
you resize the main window. Point taken, though.

&gt;<i> I'm a little fuzzy on the colour coding. It's not Intuitively Obvious
</I>&gt;<i> To The Most Casual Observer... 
</I>
I wouldn't disagree. But I'm not sure how to make it so (IOTTMCO).

&gt;<i> you might want to revise your choices. 
</I>
Suggestions?

&gt;<i> But for a first beta, it's nice.
</I>
Thanks -- your input is much appreciated.
