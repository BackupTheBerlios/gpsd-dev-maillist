</I>
Take 'information density' as 'number of unique data items per square inch'.
I don't like too much eye candy in relation to information provided.
I like smaller sats with just the prn better than having information
put in two places.

&gt;<i> &gt; The old one displays more information using less real estate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Arguable, depending on what data you're interested in. You like the
</I>&gt;<i> satellite list. I like seeing more (and pause-able) GPSD data. Putting the
</I>&gt;<i> satellite list (which is less needed, IMHO, now that I display the exact
</I>&gt;<i> signal:noise ratio in the graphical satellite display) on a 2nd tab while
</I>&gt;<i> expanding the GPSD data area seemed like a good compromise to me -- we each
</I>&gt;<i> have all the data we ever had in the old app (and more); yours is just 1
</I>&gt;<i> click away.
</I>
Nothing to argue here. The old app put the same amount of information
into less screen real estate.
Your suggestion of resizing the main window to get all 12 sats listed is
counter productive in this sense.

&gt;<i> Without trying to sound glib, if you really like the old one, you'll be
</I>&gt;<i> able to keep using it, since ESR has stated that this new app cannot
</I>&gt;<i> replace the &quot;agnostic&quot; old app, although you'll have to continue to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with Motif, something which doesn't bother me at all, incidentally.
</I>
Right...

&gt;<i> If you have some specific recommendations, I'm &quot;all ears&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for doing this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're welcome. :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You just don't know how much the Motif dependency is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bugging me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not enough to have written your own Gtk or Qt or WxWidgets or FLTK client,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm guessing. ;^)
</I>
You are absolutely right. After having written the Motif app a decade ago I 
became annoyed with it over time. Low level annoying == not enough itch.

You on the other hand... ;^)

&gt;<i> P.S. Sorry for the delayed reply. Your email arrived 1 day after you sent
</I>&gt;<i> it!
</I>
Dns problem on my end. I hope this one goes faster.

Cheers,
Remco
