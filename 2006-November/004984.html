get a switching mode regulated power supply that can provide ~ 1.0-2.5
Amps many will let you pick 3/5/6/9/12v DC. Do yourself a favour and get
a good one. Get a nice bench top adjustable power supply with a current
limiter if you really want to impress the neighbors &amp; don't mind
spending a couple hundred.

If the thing is designed an embedded item it may really be serious with
the &quot;regulated&quot; part. The cheapo radio shack one may not be regulated:
the voltage drops as soon as it is under load. Most 5v IC chips start to
fail after you dip below 4.5v. The initial powerup and sky search will
take more power than after the thing is locked on.

Or get a 7.5/9v DC 800mA+ adapter and wire in a LM7805 + heat sink (some
assembly required).

Or even cheaper: tap off the 5V line (red) from an old PC power supply.

FWIW, we had a trimble unit fail just a couple of days ago when we tried
powering it with a cheap 300mA DC adapter.. not enough juice. (non
fatal, but it won't stay running)
