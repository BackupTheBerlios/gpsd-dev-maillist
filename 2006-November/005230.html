&gt;<i> If I decide to implement that, I need you guys to tell me _exactly_ what you

</I>&gt;<i> these questions, all pertaining to just the graphical portion of the
</I>&gt;<i> satellite display:
</I>
My implementation of a grapher-thingy should give you some answers,
but it's probably better if I answer in full sentences.

&gt;<i>    - Should SNR (in dB) be displayed at all? If so, should the text be
</I>&gt;<i> colorized to indicate any SNR threshold(s)? If so, how?
</I>
Relative signal strength is more important than absolute; poor, fair,
good and excellent. I'd have to go digging through my reference
directory to find the source, but one of the specs says 35dB is good,
and it looks like most timing receivers want at least one signal over
40dB.

I'm not sure text should be colourized unless it enhances readability
or is significantly informative.

And relative position - with some choice gridlines - was more
important than precise coordinates.

&gt;<i>    - What should be the iconic representation of the satellite? A circle? If
</I>&gt;<i> so, what radius? Filled or unfilled (or dependent on &quot;in use&quot;)?
</I>
The centroid of the icon should be located at the satellite's
position. I prefer symmetric icons

Circles were easier to draw and rescale in gd than triangles. Maybe up
or down triangles?

I chose 8 or 12 pixel circles because they were big enough to be
clearly seen but didn't clutter the display. And they were small
enough to suggest a precise point, rather than a fairly large region
of space.

Hollow seemed like a good way to indicate &quot;there's something there,
but it doesn't matter; this PRN is not used in the navigation
solution&quot;.

&gt;<i>    - What color should the circle be? Based on SNR? Based on &quot;in use&quot;? Based
</I>&gt;<i> on PRN (e.g. WAAS are different, like Kuethe's site)? If SNR-based, how many
</I>&gt;<i> colors and what colors? If based on &quot;in use&quot;, what 2 colors? Same question if
</I>&gt;<i> PRN-based.
</I>
IIRC, SiRFdemo uses green, red and blue. Green is tracked and used,
red is untracked and unused, blue is tracked but unused. And SBAS PRNs
are cyan.

It seemed unfair to mark the SBAS PRNs as unused or used on the same
criteria as the regular NAVSTAR PRNs.

There are a couple of non-obvious colours: blue if it's low elevation
(&lt;10) and orange (SBAS). I thought those were nice to see, but they
are wholly unecessary. Low elevation satellites will probably have
marginal signal anyway, and most people won't care that SBAS doesn't
transmit a ranging code. SBAS should probably be marked as used or
unused based on the fix quality (DGPS or not), as that's what our
users probably care about.

&gt;<i>    - If the circle does not encompass the text, where should the PRN text be
</I>&gt;<i> drawn? In what color(s)? Where should the SNR be displayed? Both in the same
</I>&gt;<i> block? One above and one below the circle?
</I>
Simple black-and-white is clear and authoritative. Text very close to
the icon suggested the link.

I'll reiterate: I'm not asking for you to draw a protractor, or to
format the sky like a floppy disk, but I found that a few radials and
elevation lines helped me to grok the satellite positions far more
than a table of numbers.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
