<PRE>Having audited the relevant code, I now believe we can do a good enough
job of restoring GPS settings on close of session to make a runtime 
no-reconfigure option unnecessary for over 85% of cases.  

This job is a little simpler because we don't have to try to restore things
like baud rate or cycle time changes from the B and C commands.  We just
have to revert what the configurator method does on startup.

The appropriate hook (the wrapup method) is already in our driver
architecture.  What's needed are (a) per-driver ways to query the
settings that configurator methods change, (b) code to stash that state
in driver private storage just before the configurator method tweaks it, 
and (c) code to restore it in the wrapup method.

I committed two changes last night, to the SiRF and Evermore drivers, that
restore NMEA mode on device close if the configurator method had switched 
the device to binary.  This is a good start.  Here is a driver-by-driver 
summary of what else needs to happen:

The TripMate, EarthMate, TNTC, Zodiac, and RTCM104 drivers don't have
configurator methods and thus don't need any state restored on exit.

The generic NMEA driver was reconfiguring Motorola OnCore and 
Sony CXD2951 chips to suppress PSGSA and enable ZDA.   While doing
this investivation I discovered that ZDA is actually in the default
sentence mix for these chips.  I removed the configurator method,
which may expose users who have explicitly turned ZDA off to a 
century-rollover problem in 94 years but means we no longer
step on any generic NMEA settings at all.

The Evermore driver now restores NMEA when necessary.  This appears to be
the only thing it configures, so we're done.

The SiRF driver now restores NMEA when necessary.  I think we can do a
perfect job of reverting changes during binary sessions by requesting a
Navigation Parameters message and restoring the configuration it gives
us on wrapup.  I have not tried to write that code.  I'll do it if
Chris Kuethe doesn't jump in.

The TSIP driver changes its per-cycle sentence inventory and thus 
needs some state-restore logic.  This can be done; the same packet 0x35
we use to configure it can be sent in a no-argument mode to query
the current sentence mix for later restore.  We don't have code to
do this yet.

The FV18 changes its per-cycle sentence inventory to include GSAs. It
is possible to query that inventory, though we don't have code to do
it yet.

That's the good news; we can handle the vast majority of cases gracefully.
Now for the bad news:

Garmin devices are a mess.  We reconfigure those heavily, and I
don't know if there's any way to capture their configuration state
before we do it. Gary, can you shed any light on this?

The iTrax02 driver sets SYNCMODE to start navigation messages without
checking to see if it's already on, and stops navigation methods on
wrapup.  It also forces the set of sentences issued.  We lose on this
one; I don't see a way to query these settings.
