Just to be clear... I wasn't suggesting that or thinking that you were. It was 
just to make a point.

</I>&gt;<i> things aren't it.
</I>
I disagree. And I don't see how those two goals require compromise. My circles 
are both visible and representative of the actual sky geometry. The center of 
the circle represents the position of the satellite, regardless of the size 
of the circle. If you're arguing simply based on aesthetics, I'd listen and 
be inclined to go with the consensus. But if you're suggesting somehow that 
my large circles don't represent actual sky geometry, then we'll have to 
argue some more, because that's just not true!

If, as I suspect, you're arguing that the circles are too big (and that can 
only be an aesthetics issue, IMHO), then the only solution is to put the PRN 
and SNR (in dB) outside the circle, which may save a bit of screen space at 
the expense of introducing possible confusion (especially for small window 
sizes) due to spatial disassociation.

In reality, I don't think you'd object as much if you saw it with the display 
area enlarged, in which case the &quot;big moonlike things&quot; look much smaller in 
comparison. But I'm no longer convinced that I understand your objection.

Also, even at the small display size and large circle size, I don't see where 
there will be very much overlap -- it's still very obvious where the 
satellites are and the data should be readable. If not, you can always 
increase the window size (even on an 800x600 pixel display) and/or collapse 
the &quot;Raw GPSD Data&quot; area to get a bigger Satellite Geometry view.

No circle you draw is going to be representative of a satellite, so you might 
as well be practical and provide high information density in as non-confusing 
a manner as possible. If you haven't already, read 'The Visual Display of 
Quantitative Information' by Edward Tufte.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a pragmatist and I tend to like the circles enclosing the graphics,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for their lack of ambiguity (about what text goes with what satellite;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not a big issue, I'll admit) and the waste of the space. My big circles
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; look very un-satellite-like, but they're unambiguous and don't waste
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possible solution -- restore the satellite dot, with a line leading off to
</I>&gt;<i> a thin-walled box enclosing the summary data.  Or just have a square box
</I>&gt;<i> with one corner slightly swollen into a location dot.
</I>
Frankly, I don't like either of those solutions. The first introduces even 
more visual elements (clutter) and the second seems... unintuitive? 
inelegant? If drawing a circle large enough to encompass the text that's 
associated with the satellite is really deemed an unacceptable solution by 
the majority, then I'd vote to display the data just outside a smaller, 
filled, colored circle, much like the Motif 'xgps' (and Chris' web display) 
does now. Actually, it might be something that should be configurable by the 
user. Personally, I think that using the Motif 'xgps' method with the extra 
SNR/dB text will lead to more clutter and confusion than my method, though. 
I've been using my GPS moving map app on the road for many years now. It uses 
essentially the same display for satellite geometry that my Gtk2 'xgps' does. 
It's something that's been tried and tested, so I don't want to discard it 
without a good reason. And you have not convinced me.
