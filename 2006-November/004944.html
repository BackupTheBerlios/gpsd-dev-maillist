I haven't looked at the code for 'cgps', but I've spent some time over the 
last few days working on a Gtk2-based replacement for 'xgps'. This is a task 
which has been on my mind since we discussed this back in Feb 2006 and one 
which became more important as I'm hearing about and experiencing more 
GNU/Linux distributions releasing without Motif (OpenMotif, that is).

I wasn't planning on mentioning this until I had worked out some issues with 
it, but I figure now is a good time to &quot;pipe up&quot;, lest some decisions get 
made in this ensuing discussion that would otherwise cause me grief. :^)

If things work out the way I'm hoping, my Gtk2-based version will be better in 
some ways than the current version of 'xgps', rather than a simple clone.

I'll try to get a screenshot or two posted within the next several days, in 
order that I might get some feedback.

Like all GUI toolkits, Gtk2 has some annoying quirks and shortcomings. 
Unfortunately, it also seems to be documented far more poorly than Motif. 

My new 'xgps' needs more work and a lot more testing before I'm ready to 
submit a trial version, but what I have so far looks promising.
