<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> 1) I've been known to extract a tarball just to read the manpages it
</I>&gt;<i> contains.
</I>
By hypothesis, then, you're reading the source man markup.  Is XML 
more difficult?

&gt;<i> 2) Many projects have an explicitly stated policy that development
</I>&gt;<i> happens in current/HEAD... patches are to be submitted against
</I>&gt;<i> current. If a patch does not conform, the submitter is gently educated
</I>&gt;<i> on how to do it right. So we might have to do a bit of handholding,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't think I've had to tell anyone more than once &quot;please use
</I>&gt;<i> diff -u&quot; or &quot;can you send a diff against HEAD&quot;?
</I>
Experience has not been quite so kind to me, alas.

&gt;<i> When you have your Release Engineer hat on, you do things like
</I>&gt;<i> generate configure and Makefile.in ... I fail to see the problem with
</I>&gt;<i> generating other things (like manpages) that users are not expected to
</I>&gt;<i> change. It's not as if we're taking the sources away - we're offering
</I>&gt;<i> them the luxury of ignorance. They don't have to know anything about
</I>&gt;<i> how the documenation gets there, just that the manpages are there.
</I>
Maybe I'm dim this morning, but I don't see what this has to do with
the argument Gary is making.

Nothing I have done takes manual pages away from the users.  The
manual pages don't magically get transplanted to /usr/share/man when
you download the tarball.  You have to perform an installation 
step for that to happen.  Removing the .man sources from the repo
does *nothing to change this*.

And why Jeff is saying &quot;The absence of man pages is a detriment to me&quot;
I just don't understand.  Jeff, is it that you want to be able to read 
the generated manual page sources?  If so, why?  What's wrong or bad
about installing xsltproc?
