<PRE>Ed W &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">lists at wildgooses.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Not an advocation either way, but I have migrated quite a few simple SVN  
</I>&gt;<i> projects up to github and largely speaking it's a fairly painless  
</I>&gt;<i> process.  It depends on your requirements to have an absolutely perfect  
</I>&gt;<i> migration straight away, but the actual commits migrate one to one, the  
</I>&gt;<i> issues are largely with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - matching commiter svn names with an email address that git uses (easy  
</I>&gt;<i> if you have few committers)
</I>
Hm.  How does git svn handle this issue?

&gt;<i> - branches - generally fine if it's a trunk/release kind of setup. I  
</I>&gt;<i> found a few screwy things where sometimes the source svn repo appeared  
</I>&gt;<i> corrupt, but no one really noticed before
</I>
We have no branches.  We do have tags.  One question I've been curious
about is whaty svn-to-git conversion does to SVN tags.  Do they turn into
branches, or do they turn into symbolic revision name a la RCS/CVS?
I would consider the latter preferable.

&gt;<i> - Line endings. Nothing bad happens if you use windows line endings, but  
</I>&gt;<i> all the git tools assume unix line endings and it tends to diff less  
</I>&gt;<i> than optimally or show a bogus changed file if you leave a bunch of  
</I>&gt;<i> windows line endings AND certain options are set at the users end in  
</I>&gt;<i> their .gitconfig.  Doesn't worry most people, but I find it irritating.   
</I>&gt;<i> You can't change old commits, but you can do a quick fix and commit it  
</I>&gt;<i> as a trunk change
</I>
Not an issue.  We have no Windows line endings.

&gt;<i> One of the nice things about git is that you can actually rewrite the  
</I>&gt;<i> whole repo and the tree after the event (if you wish).  commands like  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;git rebase&quot; can let you do super funky things (in general don't do them  
</I>&gt;<i> though) such as completely re-ordering commits, merging them, splitting  
</I>&gt;<i> them out, dropping whole commits, all with an interactive interface!
</I>
I have a script in the gpsd repo at devtools/editcomment that I can use to fix
typos in old revision comments.  How would you implement that in git?  If I
were to do such a tweak, what would thge implications be for push-pull-merge
operations? 

(Note: The current version of the SVN repo, and sanooj's git mirror, has all
known typos fixed.  I'd like to preserve the capability to do this,
however, as I typo a lot...)

&gt;<i> If you would like someone to do a trial conversion, say to github (which  
</I>&gt;<i> isn't a bad place just to park a git tree and wiki) then let me know and  
</I>&gt;<i> I will try and help - I believe others have already done this to various  
</I>&gt;<i> extents though.
</I>
Sanooj maintains an unofficial git mirror now, which was a good thing
during the berlios site outage.

&gt;<i> Now my 2p: If you try the conversion and it looks straightforward and  
</I>&gt;<i> nothing obviously breaks, personally I would suggest you just do the  
</I>&gt;<i> migration at the same time as you jump ship...  Keep a copy of the old  
</I>&gt;<i> svn repo for historical purposes/backup
</I>
I'd do the latter anyway.  I'm still disinclined to combine a version-control
changeover with a site migration, unless we're moving to a site dedicated
to a single VCS such as github or bitbucket.

Ed: thanks, by the way, for listing these issues. I think none of them are
going to bite us, but I found your roundup of them very informative.

This is probably a good point at which to mention that yesterday I 
joined the development team for Savane, the hosting engine that powers 
gna.org.  I'll divagate on my reasons in a separate post.  The point 
here is that gna.org just got a lot more attractive; I even have root
access to the live Gna! host now.

(Yes, Chris, this means that as of now I *am* a gna.org admin... :-)
