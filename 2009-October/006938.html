Not an advocation either way, but I have migrated quite a few simple SVN 
projects up to github and largely speaking it's a fairly painless 
process.  It depends on your requirements to have an absolutely perfect 
migration straight away, but the actual commits migrate one to one, the 
issues are largely with:

- matching commiter svn names with an email address that git uses (easy 
if you have few committers)
- branches - generally fine if it's a trunk/release kind of setup. I 
found a few screwy things where sometimes the source svn repo appeared 
corrupt, but no one really noticed before
- Line endings. Nothing bad happens if you use windows line endings, but 
all the git tools assume unix line endings and it tends to diff less 
than optimally or show a bogus changed file if you leave a bunch of 
windows line endings AND certain options are set at the users end in 
their .gitconfig.  Doesn't worry most people, but I find it irritating.  
You can't change old commits, but you can do a quick fix and commit it 
as a trunk change


One of the nice things about git is that you can actually rewrite the 
whole repo and the tree after the event (if you wish).  commands like 
&quot;git rebase&quot; can let you do super funky things (in general don't do them 
though) such as completely re-ordering commits, merging them, splitting 
them out, dropping whole commits, all with an interactive interface!

The punchline really is that if you are dropping legacy SVN users (if!) 
then really the job is just to get all the commits into the new repo - 
even after the fact you can jiggle them about and recreate any previous 
state (a branch in git is really just an ordered series of commits - you 
can grab pretty much any bunch of commits in any order and call it a 
branch...)

Can't comment on mecurial/bazaar, for sure they are probably as good, 
but don't personally have any experience.

If you would like someone to do a trial conversion, say to github (which 
isn't a bad place just to park a git tree and wiki) then let me know and 
I will try and help - I believe others have already done this to various 
extents though.

Now my 2p: If you try the conversion and it looks straightforward and 
nothing obviously breaks, personally I would suggest you just do the 
migration at the same time as you jump ship...  Keep a copy of the old 
svn repo for historical purposes/backup

Good luck
