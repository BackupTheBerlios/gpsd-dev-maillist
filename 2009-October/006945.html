As Greg says you use a mapping file, eg something like this is a good 
import &quot;script&quot;

git-svn clone -A ./git.authors --stdlayout  <A HREF="svn://blah">svn://blah</A>

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Git has cheap branching, so everything is a branch.  That said I believe 
it has some makeup to gloss over certain types of branches and call them 
&quot;tags&quot;, but in practice they all behave like branches.  I would need to 
do a trial import to see what the importer does without tweaking, but 
git-svn is in massive production use around the world so imagine 
anything you want it to do is possible...

Note pretty much anything can be treated as a branch in git.  So for 
example you can take a commit reference and use that a &quot;branch&quot; to 
checkout, or diff against, or whatever...  Unbelievably powerful really


&gt;<i> I have a script in the gpsd repo at devtools/editcomment that I can use to fix
</I>&gt;<i> typos in old revision comments.  How would you implement that in git?  If I
</I>&gt;<i> were to do such a tweak, what would thge implications be for push-pull-merge

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Git will let you rewrite history as much as you like - if you so desire...

However, beware that once someone else pulls down your changes then 
&quot;editing&quot; a commit is going to cause them pain to sync back with you.  
What this means in practice is that you tend to work like:

- Create a branch, hack, hack, commit lots and tend to commit in smaller 
bite sized chunks than you would with svn (git gives you tools to commit 
even just *parts* of the diff to files!)
- If you have been hacking a lot then create a new merge branch and use 
this to bring trunk and your hack branch to a release quality
- Switch to trunk and pull in either all your merge branch, or 
alternatively just cherry pick bits from any other branch including 
remote branches pulled in from other contributors
- This is all done on your local repo, once you are happy that trunk is 
how you want it then you push it up to your distribution server.  From 
that point you prefer never to edit a commit - instead you will only 
send new commits

So the point is you have a lot of new tools to branch and code in much 
smaller chunks locally.  This gives you a much higher commit quality 
(well at least for me it's transformed my commits from mega chunks to 
smaller bite sized things which each tell a story).  But once you push 
changes public you don't edit them again

&gt;<i> Sanooj maintains an unofficial git mirror now, which was a good thing
</I>&gt;<i> during the berlios site outage.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I suspect you should just evaluate his repo for quality and then switch 
to that if it's good?


&gt;&gt;<i> Keep a copy of the old  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> svn repo for historical purposes/backup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd do the latter anyway.  I'm still disinclined to combine a version-control
</I>&gt;<i> changeover with a site migration, unless we're moving to a site dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> to a single VCS such as github or bitbucket.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Sounds safe - however, I think if you don't change you never will... I 
personally would argue that everyone is going to go through a whole 
bunch of upheaval when you move, so you might as well keep going and 
break more...

I could be wrong, but I always found changing the svn repo url a bit of 
a pain... I think tortoisesvn had a utility to do it, but I wouldn't 
personally know how to do it from the commandline.

My 2p would be that since everyone has to update their RPM/ebuild's, 
plus fix their svn repos, etc, etc - why not go the whole hog and do all 
your pent up changes in one go?  Presumably people are more forgiving of 
breakages right now on the grounds that everything is up in the air at 
the moment?

However, since you now picked a destination for the site - does gna 
support git?  Never looked myself?  This alone probably determines your 
choices quite a bit?

My 2p is still that since you are changing never everything you should 
continue to spoil everyone's day and pick your final VCS system also...

Good luck

Ed W
