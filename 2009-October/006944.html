Actually once you start using git I think you will be surprised.  It's 
not really the distribute bit which is cool, it's more that it gives you 
the ability to run in 5 different directions trying stuff, THEN at a 
later stage to come back and actually do something useful with all of 
that.  Yes in theory SVN has branches, but hands up anyone who has 
actually used them? 

So for example if you were hacking on gpsd with some new idea you would 
just branch and code.  Then if someone emailed a critical patch you 
would just switch back to the live branch, check in the change, test and 
release.  Then if you suddenly noticed some great idea on live you would 
branch again and quickly hack away and commit for later study (call all 
these hack branches &quot;wip_something&quot;).  Now you switch back to your 
original hacking branch and decide to hack on, but you want to see all 
changes based on trunk, now git is smart enough to rebase all your 
changes onto trunk and if necessary it will rewrite any of your commits 
if for example you partially included one commit in another one.  
Finally switch back to master and just cherry pick bits of commits from 
various wip branches (literally just pick bits out of any branch) and 
off you go

So that all sounds theoretical - how does it help in practice.

Well as a user I can:

- Submit a bunch of changes I have locally.  If you accept *some* of 
those changes, then when I rebase my local tree it (optionally) actually 
rewrites my commits so that I just see the outstanding changes that you 
didn't accept as individual commits.  In this way I can easily maintain 
a &quot;changes_to_push_upstream&quot; branch and track what I send you and which 
bits you haven't yet taken, eg need re-work

- Maintain an independent branch with some local patches that work for 
me.  This is not possible to do with vanilla svn!  So I can source 
control my own patches AND I can merge in all the upstream patches.  At 
any time I can see what's different in my tree and upstream.  If any of 
my local patches no longer make sense it's easy to track individual 
commits even from years ago and say reverse them from my local tree 
(even though they may now be themselves not cleanly apply to the trunk, 
git can figure out what to do, including seeing through renamed files, etc!)


Being able to work offline is actually a relatively small subset of the 
cool stuff you can now do!

Nah, actually I do agree.  Notice in my emails I commented that I don't 
know mercurial/bazaar - both have their own proponents, I just don't 
know them myself...

I think just like svn you can learn the basics fairly easily to at least 
get some work done.  I would agree getting to know the advanced stuff is 
a barrier with any tool.  That said I think some basic git experience is 
worth everyone gaining because so many opensource projects are using it 
that at least being able to checkout some repository is practically a given

I have pretty much gone the other way - these days I can hardly remember 
how to do much more than check-in/out of svn and probably given half a 
chance I would just use git-svn and be done with it...

I found this book excellent (get the ebook say)
<A HREF="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git</A>

Also there is at least as good documentation on the git website (which 
is obviously free) and you have a selection of graphical tools available 
for nearly all platforms (personally I only use the command line except 
for visualising branches)

Good luck
