You are answering one question with the information about a different
question, please re-read up the thread?

To recap in this case I was saying that I didn't see gpsd &quot;release&quot; the
device once it failed to identify it as a gps. You were (I think?)
postulating an idea where I just check my modem device's into gpsd and
then when I spot them being &quot;released&quot; that I run some other scan on
them to see if they are really a modem?  I don't think this strategy
will work with gpsd in it's current state?

So my assertion is that really it would be useful to have a udev utility
which determines the type of many common serial devices (PnP for serial
ports...).  My chain of thought so far is that there is already a very
good detection routine in gpsd and hence perhaps that was a good
starting point for this utility, ie starting with a mature scanner for a
broad class of devices and just add in additional devices to the scanner.

Just an idea anyway...

I still have to somehow solve the problem that I have a whole bunch of
PL2303 devices being plugged in and some of them have a modem on the end
and others have a gps on them. Any other suggestions appreciated for
matching the correct device with the correct extra setup...?
