<PRE>This note collects my thoughts on what I'll officially dub &quot;the
multipacket bug&quot;, recently analyzed in some detail by Olivier Cornu
after having been partially characterized by sanooj some weeks ago.

I've beem keeping quiet in the discussion because I think it's a goood
thing that other people on the list are doing analysis this deep into
the main dispatcher code.  One of my concerns about the GPSD project is
that we don't have enough people who grok the whole architecture, so
I wasn't to encourage others to get up to speed.  If someone *other than
me* could solve this, it would be a good indicator for the health of
the project.

Olivier Cornu writes in &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">AANLkTimzxYmdU2UXgV231VgkHRboPwSs8ZuYgQG3mqh3 at mail.gmail.com</A>&gt; (lightly edited):
&gt;<i>The design wrongly assumes packets will be received
</I>&gt;<i>one-at-a-time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>GPS device may actually send them one-at-a-time, yet there is no
</I>&gt;<i>guarantee that's how they'll be received by gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i>This is how it currently works:
</I>&gt;<i>  1. wait until new tty input is available  [gpsd.c:1639]
</I>&gt;<i>  2. append it into inbuffer                [packet.c:1646]
</I>&gt;<i>  3. parse first inbuffer packet            [packet.c:1684]
</I>&gt;<i>  4. broadcast it to clients                [gpsd.c:1709]
</I>&gt;<i>  5. back to 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What if 2 packets arrive at time t? First one will be parsed and
</I>&gt;<i>broadcast at time t, then main loop() will wait until t+1 packets
</I>&gt;<i>arrive to parse the 2d packet.
</I>&gt;<i>First bug:  clients receive packets with a lag.
</I>&gt;<i>Second bug: this lag can only get bigger (if multiple packets are
</I>&gt;<i>again received).
</I>&gt;<i>Perhaps more once buffers get full.
</I>
Olivier is right. The code copes gracefully with the case where a read
finishes a packet and has some characters of a new packet come in
after; what it doesn't handle is the case where a read pulls in an
entire two or more packets.

Olivier's language confused Remco Teffcorn a bit.  Remco didn't
initially get that &quot;At the same time&quot; meant &quot;in the same physical
write&quot;.

It's rather unlikely for this to happen on a real serial devices, as
those tend to get data through the UART in small (often
single-character) chunks that are much smaller than a packet size,
and there are typically delays on the order of a hundred milliseconds
between packets.  

If this did happen, it would be noticeable as an increasing lag in
reported time (packets getting reported with increasing lag).  But
even this is not an infallible sign, as very similar &quot;stairstep lag&quot;
symptoms can be produced on a low-baudrate connection if the GPS gets
configured to try to send more data than will feed in one cycle.
(Yes, we've observed this in SiRF chips.)

The most common case where it *does* happen observably is in the regression
tests.  Depending on the timing, the pty layer may aggregate two
adjacent packet writes to a master device into one physical write from
the slave.  The result is the sporadic random regression failures we
get where it looks like the last couple of packets are never emitted.

One could readily imagine this happening if packets are being read from
a <A HREF="tcp://">tcp://</A> source.  Again, the socket laher might aggregate writes in
a timing-dependent way; TCP/IP makes no guarantees.

We don't have to imagine Olivier's use case.  As he says:

&gt;<i>I'm working on an app (gps2nmea) where location info is updated every
</I>&gt;<i>~5s. From this info, corresponding NMEA packets are crafted and sent
</I>&gt;<i>on a tty. Excellent conditions to showcase this bug.
</I>&gt;<i>When there's a valid fix and good satellites data, 6 or 7 packets can
</I>&gt;<i>be sent at once. In other words, every 5s the lag is growing by 30s!
</I>

Schlueter writes:

&gt;<i>I thought I remember hearing a bug that might fit this description a
</I>&gt;<i>while ago.  A certain gps would get behind X seconds and would never
</I>&gt;<i>catch up.  If they restarted GPSD it would show the current position
</I>&gt;<i>and be ok for a while.
</I>
Jon is right.  It was a SiRF, and we tracked this down to the baud 
rate being too low.  This produced a FAQ entry; read the last 
paragraph of &lt;<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html#timelag">http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html#timelag</A>&gt;.

He asks:

&gt;<i>Olivier, did you dig through processing code and confirm that when
</I>&gt;<i>multiple NEMA sentences (&quot;Packets&quot;) come in during one read that only
</I>&gt;<i>the first one gets parsed?  If so then maybe we need to capture or
</I>&gt;<i>generate a regression log to confirm this issue.
</I>
Yes, we do need a regression test for this issue. I don't know how to etite
one, because all the ways I know to trigger it are randomly dependent on
race conditions in various bit transports (ptys, in particular).  However,
it sounds like Olivier might have a reproducible test.

Jon continues: 

&gt;<i>Another alternative method for modifying the loop is to check if we
</I>&gt;<i>have not processes or looked at all data in the buffer, spin again and
</I>&gt;<i>process the buffer till we have.  But you use the larger outside loop
</I>&gt;<i>for processing the backlog of data in the incoming buffer.
</I>
Jon is quite right.  This requires a change in the core dispatcher logic.

&gt;<i>Of course, confirmations from tiers would be more than welcome.
</I>
Consider it confirmed.

Greg Troxel points out that while plain serial devices are unlikely
to trigger this problem, USB devices are a different story.  In
&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">rmibpc5fppy.fsf at fnord.ir.bbn.com</A>&gt; he writes:

&gt;<i>With USB devices, USB packets (not what gpsd calls packets) arrive,
</I>&gt;<i>containing some number of bytes.  These are added to the usb tty input
</I>&gt;<i>queue all at once.
</I>
He finishes:

&gt;<i>So, it seems pretty clear that gpsd should, after getting a packet from
</I>&gt;<i>the buffer, redo the check on the buffer to make sure there is not
</I>&gt;<i>another full packet.  It's not obvious how to change this in the code
</I>&gt;<i>with the least amount of trouble.
</I>
And that is indeed the issue.  I'm not sure how to do it either.  I'm going to
look at Jon Schlueter's patch next.
