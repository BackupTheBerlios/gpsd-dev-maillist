<PRE>Joe Davidson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nugins99 at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The firmware rev that I get is:
</I>&gt;<i>  gpsd: Software version: 3.0 020627 10.2 011114
</I>
Noted.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1)   The primary time message (0x84ab)  comes out right before the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; position
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; message (0x8fac).   The time message does not get reported to clients.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There is a REPORT_IS message was not being added to the mask for the time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; messages.  Is this intentional?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes.  The REPORT flag should be set only for the sentence that ends the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; device's reporting cycle.  Any time information from previous sentence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be a merged part of the report.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think the reports are getting merged correctly.   I removed the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;REPORT_IS&quot; flag from the first message.   Without the REPORT flag,  cgps
</I>&gt;<i> does not receive the time tag.  I'm just guessing that because cgps has a
</I>&gt;<i> field for time, that the normal behavior is that clients will receive a time
</I>&gt;<i> tag with the position updates.
</I>
The second version of your patch applied wgat I think is the correct
fix for this problem, moving the CLEAR operation to the TIMING
packet.  I have merged that fix.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2) The receiver mode flag was always being reported as &quot;0&quot; whenever gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; gets restarted.   If I power cycle the gps, the reciever mode gets forced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; back to &quot;4&quot; which  indicates the receiver has the full 3D position.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Restarting gpsd again causes the receiver flag to zero out again.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand this report, sorry.  You'll need to be specific about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whose &quot;receiver mode flag&quot; this is, and how the actual behavior differs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the expected behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This receiver mode is what is being reported by the GPS.   The receiver
</I>&gt;<i> modes are:
</I>&gt;<i> Auto/Time/2D/3D/DGPS Ref/Clock Hold(2D)/Overdetermined Clock.   The reciever
</I>&gt;<i> mode field in the supplemental time packet for the thunderbolt is defined to
</I>&gt;<i> hold the mode setting the GPS is currently configured for.   The manual
</I>&gt;<i> seems to indicate that this field doesn't have anything to do with the
</I>&gt;<i> current fix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code interprets this field to indicate what kind of fix the GPS
</I>&gt;<i> currently has.   To verify this,   I started gpsd, had it detect &amp; configure
</I>&gt;<i> the Thunderbolt.   Then I power cycled the GPS.  When the GPS came back up,
</I>&gt;<i> the receiver mode was &quot;3D fix&quot;, but the Lat/Long/Alt reported by the GPS was
</I>&gt;<i> 0/0/0.  (This worked this way because of a minor bug:  GPSD doesn't seem to
</I>&gt;<i> recognize when the Trimble is powercycled and resend configuration).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reciever mode flag is the mode the Thunderbolt is operating in.   In
</I>&gt;<i> tsip_event_hook() the following lines force the trimble to an auto (2D/3D
</I>&gt;<i> mode):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         /* Set Position Fix Mode (auto 2D/3D) */
</I>&gt;<i>         putbyte(buf, 0, 0x00);
</I>&gt;<i>         (void)tsip_write(session, 0x22, buf, 1);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is possibly a difference in how different trimble devices handle this
</I>&gt;<i> command.  It appears that this command causes Thunderbolt (with the above SW
</I>&gt;<i> version) to report &quot;Auto&quot; mode in the supplemental timing packet. Removing
</I>&gt;<i> this command appears to fix the lack of position updates from getting
</I>&gt;<i> reported to clients in my environment because the receiver will report that
</I>&gt;<i> it is in a 3D mode.   I'm not advocating removing this line at this point
</I>&gt;<i> because I believe it was put in for a reason.  (Maybe another trimble device
</I>&gt;<i> or software version required it).
</I>
Is this still an issue?
