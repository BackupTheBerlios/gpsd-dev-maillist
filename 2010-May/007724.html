</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I tried setting up GPSD with a Trimble Thunderbolt that I have with
</I>&gt;<i> little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; luck.    The basic problem is that &quot;cgps&quot; was not getting time and
</I>&gt;<i> position
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages.   I turned on gpsd debug and did a little digging and found a
</I>&gt;<i> few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible problems within driver_tsip.c:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Chris Kuethe says he can't reproduce this on his Thunderbolt,. but
</I>&gt;<i> TSIP's behavior is sufficiently complicated and hairy that I can
</I>&gt;<i> easily imagine firmware rev making a difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The firmware rev that I get is:
 gpsd: Software version: 3.0 020627 10.2 011114


&gt;<i> &gt; 1)   The primary time message (0x84ab)  comes out right before the
</I>&gt;<i> position
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message (0x8fac).   The time message does not get reported to clients.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is a REPORT_IS message was not being added to the mask for the time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages.  Is this intentional?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  The REPORT flag should be set only for the sentence that ends the
</I>&gt;<i> device's reporting cycle.  Any time information from previous sentence
</I>&gt;<i> should be a merged part of the report.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't think the reports are getting merged correctly.   I removed the
&quot;REPORT_IS&quot; flag from the first message.   Without the REPORT flag,  cgps
does not receive the time tag.  I'm just guessing that because cgps has a
field for time, that the normal behavior is that clients will receive a time
tag with the position updates.

Here is some debug with the two messages:

gpsd: SP-TTS 0xab time=1272973636.00 mask={TIME}
gpsd: modeling errors: mode=2, masks={ONLINE|TIME|PACKET}
gpsd: SP-TPS 0xac time=nan lat=38.86 lon=-77.38 alt=142.67
mask={LATLON|ALTITUDE|MODE|CLEAR|REPORT}
gpsd: modeling errors: mode=2,
masks={ONLINE|LATLON|ALTITUDE|MODE|PACKET|CLEAR|REPORT}
gpsd: GPS Position XYZ 1086194.125000 -4853324.500000 3980093.000000
215251.000000
gpsd: modeling errors: mode=2, masks={ONLINE|PACKET}
gpsd: GPS Velocity XYZ 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.041246 215251.000000


&gt;<i> &gt; 2) The receiver mode flag was always being reported as &quot;0&quot; whenever gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gets restarted.   If I power cycle the gps, the reciever mode gets forced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back to &quot;4&quot; which  indicates the receiver has the full 3D position.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Restarting gpsd again causes the receiver flag to zero out again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand this report, sorry.  You'll need to be specific about
</I>&gt;<i> whose &quot;receiver mode flag&quot; this is, and how the actual behavior differs
</I>&gt;<i> from the expected behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This receiver mode is what is being reported by the GPS.   The receiver
modes are:
Auto/Time/2D/3D/DGPS Ref/Clock Hold(2D)/Overdetermined Clock.   The reciever
mode field in the supplemental time packet for the thunderbolt is defined to
hold the mode setting the GPS is currently configured for.   The manual
seems to indicate that this field doesn't have anything to do with the
current fix.

The code interprets this field to indicate what kind of fix the GPS
currently has.   To verify this,   I started gpsd, had it detect &amp; configure
the Thunderbolt.   Then I power cycled the GPS.  When the GPS came back up,
the receiver mode was &quot;3D fix&quot;, but the Lat/Long/Alt reported by the GPS was
0/0/0.  (This worked this way because of a minor bug:  GPSD doesn't seem to
recognize when the Trimble is powercycled and resend configuration).

The reciever mode flag is the mode the Thunderbolt is operating in.   In
tsip_event_hook() the following lines force the trimble to an auto (2D/3D
mode):


        /* Set Position Fix Mode (auto 2D/3D) */
        putbyte(buf, 0, 0x00);
        (void)tsip_write(session, 0x22, buf, 1);

There is possibly a difference in how different trimble devices handle this
command.  It appears that this command causes Thunderbolt (with the above SW
version) to report &quot;Auto&quot; mode in the supplemental timing packet. Removing
this command appears to fix the lack of position updates from getting
reported to clients in my environment because the receiver will report that
it is in a 3D mode.   I'm not advocating removing this line at this point
because I believe it was put in for a reason.  (Maybe another trimble device
or software version required it).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Before I dig into this any further,  I'd like to see if somebody familiar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the TSIP interface has some insight as to what is happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Poke ckuethe about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Below is a diff showing what I did to debug the problem and &quot;fix&quot; it.
</I>&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first change fixes the time reporting.   The second just forces the
</I>&gt;<i> position
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages to get reported if the receiver mode gets reset to zero.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Took the second band, didn't take the first and won't without more
</I>&gt;<i> careful examination.  Is the second band alone sufficient to solve your
</I>&gt;<i> bug?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks for taking the second band.  That band alone will get gpsd to report
position messages, without the first band (or some other fix), there is no
way of getting the time messages to clients.
