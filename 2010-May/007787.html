<PRE>There is a decision to make, and it mainly depends on what project
maintainers feel is the most important.

The solution proposed by Remco is the quick and safe path: a small,
non-intrusive patch that will fix the problem with, by design, no
chance to break further code -- at least, as long as gps_poll is the
only caller. Definitely not small advantages.

On the downside, it's a bit like a magic piece of rubber tape on a
flawed design.
I personally find this particularly bad as it makes the code more
difficult to understand and master, which tends to scare new
developers away and, in general, kind of paves the way for more bugs
to come.
It also is blatantly sub-efficient: in the worst case scenario
(longest packet: 516 bytes) it takes 33 main() loop spins to read a
packet that could have been read in a single system call (I'm not sure
what the average packet size is). On modern machines this is no big
deal, yet willingly wasting resources just to cover for a broken
design is nothing to be proud of...

Obviously, a proper design would be to wait until there's input
available, read as much of it as possible, parse all packets it
contains and process them.
I suppose there is a consensus around this. This is both conceptually
simple (no hidden variables or magic read() lengths) and what an
outsider would expect.
Downside is: a larger and more intrusive patch, with more room for
collateral damages.

Overall, i believe Remco's solution is the best solution in the short
term. In the long term though, fixing the design in a conceptually
clear and resource efficient way is the way to go.
Just my two cents...
