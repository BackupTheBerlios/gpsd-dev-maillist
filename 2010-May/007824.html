Another interesting bit, if one looks more in the details, is that 80%
of the time is lost in user-land, not during system calls.
Basically, it's lost running the full main() loop over and over again
just to grab and parse at most 16 bytes. By comparison, the fast
implementation runs the full main() loop only once every 2 packets
(because they arrive concatenated).
If there was a thread loop reading and parsing this tty, triggering
upper layers of code only when there is a packet to process (iow,
parts of main loop concerned with incoming packets only), the
processing time would fall even more dramatically.

Using the main() loop as a tty reading loop (16-bytes patch) has
another curious consequence: it behaves like a progressive tax on
processor speed. The fastest it is, the more cycles go up in smoke.
If your system is fast enough to run the full main() loop between each
char received on a real serial line, it probably will and you'll run
at maximum inefficiency -- which should supposedly be around 16-20
times worse than slow systems.
If the design was right, that is (according to me) if a small thread
loop was reading and parsing the tty, there would of course be no such
tax on fast systems.


Threads can be tricky, although their mis-usage often goes down to:
  - devs unused to dealing with multi-threading; in an era where even
small devices are multi-core, they'd better get up-to-date quick.
  - wrong design; most often because threads were stuck in an existing
big spaghetti cathedral of mono-threaded code (almost impossible to
nicely handle asynchronous streams with a single thread), inducing
random dead-locks and race conditions.

If the design was made around a thread spitting out packets when they
get here, there could not have been a multi-packet bug in the first
place. It all comes down to main() loop reading two packets at once --
which should be a Good Thing.
Would there have been a bug in the buffering implementation, we could
have changed it with no impact on the upper layers, as long as it
keeps spitting its packets as they arrive.


Now, i understand your prudence with threads, Greg, and i'm not trying
to say you are wrong. From a big and stable project point of view,
this probably would be too intrusive a change.
Besides, as you've noted, threads are not available everywhere. This
being said, I'm curious: what are the platforms currently supported by
gpsd that do not support threads?

As the project is faced with this little design issue, it might be a
good opportunity for maintainers to discuss long terms plans for the
global gpsd architecture? Perhaps there are such plans already?
In any case, all of this is not my call. I'm just an outsider throwing
out ideas that you can of course dismiss with no regrets, i won't take
offense. :-)


Cheers,
