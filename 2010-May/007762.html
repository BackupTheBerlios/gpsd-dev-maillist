I think the word you are looking for is 'sarcasm', but close enough.

My spending more time on this than I have to closely related to:

Give a man a fish... Teach a man how to fish...
As you noticed, I am really not as lazy as I made myself out to be.

And that is what I am having a problem with. You are dealing with a
serial connection. You receive characters one after the other, in a serial
fashion.

&gt;<i> &gt; Are you talking about gps data from the serial port?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If yes, then what is your definition of 'packet'?

</I>&gt;<i> In my context: a NMEA sentence.
</I>
And again, I am not even looking at the code. How can multiple NMEA
sentences be sent (or not sent) at the same time. You are looking at a
character stream. The buffer is filled from the tty layer via read.

It is possible that a single read returns a part of a sentence, a complete sentence,
or multiple sentences with possibly an incomplete sentence at the end. 

Is that what you mean?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; GPS device may actually send them one-at-a-time, yet there is no
</I>
Again: character stream. One after another (well: modulo any line
discipline. But I don't want to spend any brain waves on this amount of
detail when I am not even sure that that is what you mean).

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; guarantee that's how they'll be received by gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What if 3.14 packets have been received over the serial line the next
</I>&gt;<i> time you poll for input and read as much of it as you can
</I>&gt;<i> [packet.c:1646]?
</I>
It's beginning to smell like you are talking about buffered up NMEA
sentences. If that's it, why not just say so.

&gt;<i> &gt; Please also address the point why in all the time gpsd is in use nobody has been bitten
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by this bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably because GPS devices usually send packets one at a time,
</I>&gt;<i> slowly enough to let gpsd process them one by one, and regularly
</I>&gt;<i> enough to keep the lag small if ever two packets arrived at once.
</I>&gt;<i> I've talked about it on #gpsd and i'm definitely not the first one to
</I>&gt;<i> experience this kind of bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any proof nobody was ever bitten by this bug?
</I>
The fact that nobody has bitched here or on the user list is a fair
indicator to me. People do not take kindly when you send their
boat into the jetty, or make their UAV crash into the ground.

At the very least, that would make the bug you report to be less
critical than you think it is. Just seeking perspective.

&gt;<i> &gt; Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Proofs need people willing to understand them.
</I>
The burden is on the side of the claimant. In a round-about way
I was just asking for you to explain in common comp/sci language
what the problem is. You should be able to do that without me
having to hit the code.

ie: if you claim &quot;it is possible to accumulate multiple NMEA sentences into
a single read buffer, but only the first is processed and the others are deferred
til the next read...&quot; , but at this point I can only guess.

And I am not trying to annoy you. I am just making an investment.

Cheers,
Remco
