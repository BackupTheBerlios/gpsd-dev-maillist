So far we've pretty much all expressed opinions and guesses about how
fast these 2 solutions would be.
That got me curious, so i crafted a little test to actually measure
what we're talking about...


I've setup my bluetooth NMEA generator to send the following string every 20ms:
  &quot;$GPGGA,105944.48,,,,,0,,,,M,,M,,*49\r\n$GPGSV,1,1,04,08,83,154,33,07,51,052,34,13,15,082,31,05,59,299,*78\r\n&quot;
Two roughly average NMEA packets (98 chars altogether) that could
possibly be received bundled in real life.

Then i setup gpsd to read 10,000 of these packets and exit, timing the
whole thing as closely as i could with getrusage():
  $ ./gpsd -nNb /dev/rfcomm0

CPU time consumed (6 measures' average):
  * 16 bytes at a time (Remco's patch):     2654ms
      User: 2132ms
      Sys :  522ms
  * as much as possible (ugly patch above):  228ms
      User:  177ms
      Sys :   51ms

How much faster is that, in relative terms? An order of magnitude.
Please note i picked the easiest test for the 16-bytes patch: in my
real setup, it would receive 6 packets at a time in average, not just
2.

Yet how much faster is that, in absolute terms? Well, really not that
much: we've saved 2.5s of CPU time over the course of 10k packets.
How long would it usually take to receive 10k packets? 2 hours?
I guess it's also safe to argue that it's good enough...


Cheers,
