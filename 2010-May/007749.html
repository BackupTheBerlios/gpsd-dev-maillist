I think you are mistaken, I hadn't change anything about the context not being local.
My point was that &quot;int part&quot; shouldn't be in context. It's a local var now since you patched it. Good. :)

&gt;<i> &gt; * channel management:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; !AIVDM,2,2,6,B,00000000000,2*21
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (real life example just received)
</I>
&gt;<i> I now handle this case correctly, using your test to verify it.
</I>
Excellent. :)
From a purely aesthetic point of view, I would have preferred to have a single struct aivdm_context_t { ais_channel_context_t channel_context[AIVDM_CHANNELS]; } rather than calling aivdm_decode with an array, but that's not important.

&gt;<i> &gt; * after receiving packet 2 of 2, don't try to decode if there wasn't a packet 1 of 2 first: await and part moved from context to local vars, new var in context to track former chunks of the the sentence.
</I>&gt;<i> Haven't done this one yet.
</I>
Please do.
This is especially a problem when gpsd starts and the first packet it receives is the second one. It will then return incorrect garbaged information.

&gt;<i> &gt; * ais_t structure filled with 0 so that partial decoding always return the same value, not depending of previous paket.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is just the gpsdecode change, it's done.  If there's some change
</I>&gt;<i> you did in the driver itself, it's not done yet.
</I>
No, I was talking about the CLEAR macro.

ais_t is still NOT cleared for broken packets of type 21 to 26. :(

My patch removed the CLEAR macro and did a full clear all the time. I though it would be easier for code maintenance. If you don't like it, you should fix the type 21 to 26 clearing, including subcases of type 24, and so on... We might want to clear the packet for &quot;default&quot; too.

&gt;<i> &gt; * decoding of truncated packets returns false, so they are discarded.
</I>&gt;<i> Done.
</I>
You missed some places my patch was doing that: packets types 21, 22, 24B and 25A.

We need that in &quot;default&quot; too.

I think you should fix this.

&gt;<i> &gt; * check the number of fields in aivdm sentences (SEGFAULT fix)
</I>&gt;<i> That's done too.
</I>
Good :)

&gt;<i> &gt; * initialize aivdm structure with zeros, previous stack content usually isn't appropriate for aivdm_context ;)
</I>&gt;<i> Already merged.
</I>
Good :)

&gt;<i> &gt; * Default gpsd_repport, included in gpsd.so, now supports debuglevel.
</I>&gt;<i> Might be a good idea.  Belongs in a separate patch.
</I>
True. Sorry about that.

&gt;<i> &gt; regression tests FAILS on type 8 while decoding:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; !AIVDM,2,1,6,B,85MwpIiKf6&lt;M7FdjukGh=9B73IpCcMckto=3DlNcU6:,0*04
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; !AIVDM,2,2,5,A,?59R6P573,0*25
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I added some tests for simultaneous use of channel A &amp; B, and of errors when receiving and out of sequence packet.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using your tests.
</I>
Thank you :)

&gt;<i> Please send a minimal patch againsat HEAD for the rest.
</I>
*sigh* I couldn't find a problem in my patch, it's a bit frustrating.

Amongst the features you discarded was the channel selection: If the repported channel was '2' or 'B' I selected channel B. I selected channel A in all other cases.
I think we should be permissive about the channels. You are right, it should be either A or B. But it's bad to discard packets that are almost right. Don't you think an error message would be enough?

I'll talk to you in  #gpsd
