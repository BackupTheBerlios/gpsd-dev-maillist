<PRE>
  There is a decision to make, and it mainly depends on what project
  maintainers feel is the most important.

  The solution proposed by Remco is the quick and safe path: a small,
  non-intrusive patch that will fix the problem with, by design, no
  chance to break further code -- at least, as long as gps_poll is the
  only caller. Definitely not small advantages.

  On the downside, it's a bit like a magic piece of rubber tape on a
  flawed design.
  I personally find this particularly bad as it makes the code more
  difficult to understand and master, which tends to scare new
  developers away and, in general, kind of paves the way for more bugs
  to come.
  It also is blatantly sub-efficient: in the worst case scenario
  (longest packet: 516 bytes) it takes 33 main() loop spins to read a
  packet that could have been read in a single system call (I'm not sure
  what the average packet size is). On modern machines this is no big
  deal, yet willingly wasting resources just to cover for a broken
  design is nothing to be proud of...

So, on the question of what to do:

  I think the change to max out reading at 16 should be committed* right
  away.  It's a little icky, but it has no serious downsides, and it
  fixes a really serious problem.

  As for efficiency, I think the concern is overblown.  If one had a
  serial port GPSr, then there would be close to one system call per
  byte.  On USB, we're talking ~500 bytes/second arriving in a burst,
  and it taking 32 reads instead of 2 over an entire second is not a big
  deal.

  Putting in the limit-to-16 will not cause significant problems for
  anyone trying to write and debug a better fix.  It's easy to comment
  out the 2 lines for testing.

* actually, in my local repo it's committed, just not pushed.  I would
  commit --amend and add a comment explaining things, and then push.

It sounds like Olivier and Remco both favor committing, and no one is
opposed - just people who aren't 100% sure if regression tests are ok
with the change.  I'll spiff up the comment and do that.
