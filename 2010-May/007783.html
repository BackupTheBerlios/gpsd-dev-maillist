The problem is in packet_parse. It works for cases where the buffer contains a part of a sentence.
No data is put into the output buffer, and we go wait for more data.

It works if there is a complete sentence in the buffer. The sentence is copied to the output buffer
and removed from the input buffer. If there is still data in the input buffer, the unspoken
assumption is that it must be a partial sentence. This is not always true.

If indeed there is another complete sentence in the input buffer, it will not be considered
before more data is received, triggering another call to packet_parse.

Because of the complexity of the code, and how things are partitioned out, there is no
good solution. The architecture assumes that at most a single sentence is handled
per select().

The same in other words: If select gets triggered and we receive more that one sentence in
the subsequent read then we are truly hosed.

We can either change the code to handle multi sentences per single read (not me), or we
can make the assumption true: never read more than a single sentence.

I suggest that we read the lesser of (number of bytes remaining in inbuffer) or ( min(sentence_size)*2-1).

What happens now is: select triggers, we read a number of bytes guaranteed not to give us two complete
sentences. If we have not enough data for a full sentence the parser works (see top).
If the read does result in a full sentence everything will be fine also.
If after the sentence is removed from the inbuffer there are remaining character (start of next
sentence) that will work too (see above).

By reading fewer bytes then there are available, we will enter select with data available on our fd.
select will just return immediately and we go again. We are using the outer while as the 'while' we need.

I doubt the performance hit is significant.

My head is about to explode...

Cheers,
Remco
