Agreed.

&gt;&gt;<i> On the downside, it's a bit like a magic piece of rubber tape on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flawed design.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I personally find this particularly bad as it makes the code more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difficult to understand and master, which tends to scare new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers away and, in general, kind of paves the way for more bugs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to come.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree; a comment or better a FIXME will take care of that.
</I>
I's talking about clear design and clear code, not clear comments...
Although that's obviously better than nothing.

&gt;&gt;<i> It also is blatantly sub-efficient: in the worst case scenario
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (longest packet: 516 bytes) it takes 33 main() loop spins to read a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packet that could have been read in a single system call (I'm not sure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the average packet size is). On modern machines this is no big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deal, yet willingly wasting resources just to cover for a broken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design is nothing to be proud of...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It bugs me too, but realistically the impact is not that high. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think you would see it in top, but you can try it out.
</I>
I don't think one can see it with top either, but that isn't really
what top is made for either.
Note that your argument is that it would be acceptable, not efficient.
I suppose you would not argue that it'd be efficient.

&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously, a proper design would be to wait until there's input
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available, read as much of it as possible, parse all packets it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contains and process them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can not do that. It is not knowable for you how many bytes
</I>&gt;<i> are in the tty buffer. All you can do is to pick a 'reasonable' read
</I>&gt;<i> buffer size.
</I>
Sure, and that efficient size is: all the empty inbuffer space (what
the current implementation does, btw).
Please note that i'm not talking in terms of &quot;reasonable&quot;, but in
terms of efficiency.

&gt;&gt;<i> I suppose there is a consensus around this. This is both conceptually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple (no hidden variables or magic read() lengths) and what an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outsider would expect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Downside is: a larger and more intrusive patch, with more room for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collateral damages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you underestimate the effort quite a bit. Processing the sentence
</I>&gt;<i> is done much higher up the call stack. You can not see there from here.
</I>
Here's a (admittedly quick and dirty, yet a starting) patch that does
it: <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/nQ0wQ5XU">http://pastebin.com/nQ0wQ5XU</A>


&gt;&gt;<i> Overall, i believe Remco's solution is the best solution in the short
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> term. In the long term though, fixing the design in a conceptually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clear and resource efficient way is the way to go.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just my two cents...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I would do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Put it in with a 'FIXME:'.
</I>&gt;<i> Enter a bug against it, so it won't be forgotten.
</I>&gt;<i> Keep asking about it 'till I or someone else fixes the ugly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking you are where you were 6 seconds ago is bad!
</I>&gt;<i> Wasting a few innocent cpu cycles, not so much.
</I>
I'd commit your fix right away and start working on a &quot;real&quot; fix
(sorry my poor english does not allow more tempered wording).
