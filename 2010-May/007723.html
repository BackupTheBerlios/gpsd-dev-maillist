<PRE>Joe Davidson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nugins99 at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I tried setting up GPSD with a Trimble Thunderbolt that I have with little
</I>&gt;<i> luck.    The basic problem is that &quot;cgps&quot; was not getting time and position
</I>&gt;<i> messages.   I turned on gpsd debug and did a little digging and found a few
</I>&gt;<i> possible problems within driver_tsip.c:
</I>
Chris Kuethe says he can't reproduce this on his Thunderbolt,. but
TSIP's behavior is sufficiently complicated and hairy that I can
easily imagine firmware rev making a difference.

&gt;<i> 1)   The primary time message (0x84ab)  comes out right before the position
</I>&gt;<i> message (0x8fac).   The time message does not get reported to clients.
</I>&gt;<i> There is a REPORT_IS message was not being added to the mask for the time
</I>&gt;<i> messages.  Is this intentional?
</I>
Yes.  The REPORT flag should be set only for the sentence that ends the
device's reporting cycle.  Any time information from previous sentence 
should be a merged part of the report.
 
&gt;<i> 2) The receiver mode flag was always being reported as &quot;0&quot; whenever gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> gets restarted.   If I power cycle the gps, the reciever mode gets forced
</I>&gt;<i> back to &quot;4&quot; which  indicates the receiver has the full 3D position.
</I>&gt;<i> Restarting gpsd again causes the receiver flag to zero out again.
</I>
I don't understand this report, sorry.  You'll need to be specific about
whose &quot;receiver mode flag&quot; this is, and how the actual behavior differs
from the expected behavior.
 
&gt;<i> Before I dig into this any further,  I'd like to see if somebody familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with the TSIP interface has some insight as to what is happening.
</I>
Poke ckuethe about this.
 
&gt;<i> Below is a diff showing what I did to debug the problem and &quot;fix&quot; it.   The
</I>&gt;<i> first change fixes the time reporting.   The second just forces the position
</I>&gt;<i> messages to get reported if the receiver mode gets reset to zero.
</I>
Took the second band, didn't take the first and won't without more
careful examination.  Is the second band alone sufficient to solve your bug?
