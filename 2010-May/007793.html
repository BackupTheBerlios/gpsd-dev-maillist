This should be done immediately, unless somebody else wants to do the
real fix. I don't have the time for that now.

I disagree; a comment or better a FIXME will take care of that.

&gt;<i> It also is blatantly sub-efficient: in the worst case scenario

It bugs me too, but realistically the impact is not that high. I don't
think you would see it in top, but you can try it out.

&gt;<i> Obviously, a proper design would be to wait until there's input
</I>&gt;<i> available, read as much of it as possible, parse all packets it
</I>&gt;<i> contains and process them.
</I>
You can not do that. It is not knowable for you how many bytes
are in the tty buffer. All you can do is to pick a 'reasonable' read
buffer size.

You call '16' unreasonable and whatever the read buffer size is
'reasonable'.

I would call 512 much more reasonable than 16, but it is a
matter of degree. 

&gt;<i> I suppose there is a consensus around this. This is both conceptually
</I>&gt;<i> simple (no hidden variables or magic read() lengths) and what an
</I>&gt;<i> outsider would expect.
</I>&gt;<i> Downside is: a larger and more intrusive patch, with more room for
</I>&gt;<i> collateral damages.
</I>
I think you underestimate the effort quite a bit. Processing the sentence
is done much higher up the call stack. You can not see there from here.

I am working on real fix that invalidates the assumption of 'at most one
sentence per select'. Working in this context is: Sitting in my chair
seemingly napping, jumping up every 15 to 20 minutes to look at the
code.

I have an idea, I don't know if it will work...

&gt;<i> Overall, i believe Remco's solution is the best solution in the short
</I>&gt;<i> term. In the long term though, fixing the design in a conceptually
</I>&gt;<i> clear and resource efficient way is the way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> Just my two cents...
</I>
What I would do:

Put it in with a 'FIXME:'. 
Enter a bug against it, so it won't be forgotten.
Keep asking about it 'till I or someone else fixes the ugly.

Thinking you are where you were 6 seconds ago is bad!
Wasting a few innocent cpu cycles, not so much.
