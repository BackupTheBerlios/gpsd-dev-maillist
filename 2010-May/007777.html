Sorry i missed that at first, but it may be an interesting bit in case
there is still doubt about the reality of this bug:
  - the logs published above indeed used a single write() of
concatenated NMEA sentences (purely for demonstration purposes)
  - similar tests with one write() per sentence showed similar wrong
behavior, yet less systematic (as you would expect)
  - introducing a small wait() between writes() did the trick and made
gpsd process sentences properly


Concerning the solution, here are the few practical problems i see:
  1. we need to be able to tell if a packet is complete or not,
without dropping it. Currently, packet_parse() (500 lines with 17 exit
points!) processes incomplete packets as bad packets, and arbitrarily
discard() them (another related bug). packet_parse() should have a
return value indicating if current packet is complete or not.
  2. packet_get() is used all around, so changing its interface is
quite intrusive (current contract is: grab the next packet, even if
you need to block). We can update the implementation to return an
inbuffer packet when there is a complete one available, if not read()
one from tty.
  3. main() loop still needs to call a non-blocking packet_get() of
some sort to empty inbuffer. If we keep packet_get() interface intact,
that would mean a new similar function.
  4. main() loop has to be changed to loop through inbuffer packets
and broadcast them. Simply calling gps_poll() multiple times might
have side effects.
