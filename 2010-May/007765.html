The serial bus does, gpsd receive them in a block read(). By
definition, all chars from such a block are received at the same time,
serial line or not.

</I>&gt;<i> Is that what you mean?
</I>
Yes, among other things.
I also explained what happens then (providing a log of such behavior),
why (with references to the code) and proposed a solution.

&gt;<i> It's beginning to smell like you are talking about buffered up NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> sentences. If that's it, why not just say so.
</I>
The title of this thread is: &quot;input packets buffering bug&quot;.
I wrote &quot;packet&quot; because that's what it's called everywhere in gpsd
code. Either get used to it or fix it in the code, but don't blame me.

&gt;<i> The fact that nobody has bitched here or on the user list is a fair
</I>&gt;<i> indicator to me. People do not take kindly when you send their
</I>&gt;<i> boat into the jetty, or make their UAV crash into the ground.
</I>
If you put as much trust in gpsd as to let it drive your boat, i
sincerely hope i'm dead wrong about this bug&#8230; :-)

&gt;<i> At the very least, that would make the bug you report to be less
</I>&gt;<i> critical than you think it is. Just seeking perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
</I>
Look, i'm not trying to make extraordinary claims: I was simply trying
to use gpsd as a NMEA validator for my own generator and it failed.
Looking deeper into the issue, doing tests and code reviews, i found
gpsd was at fault (i may be wrong, that goes without saying -- i'm
just a human).
I'm reporting it (as clearly and fully as i can).

&gt;<i> ie: if you claim &quot;it is possible to accumulate multiple NMEA sentences into
</I>&gt;<i> a single read buffer, but only the first is processed and the others are deferred
</I>&gt;<i> til the next read...&quot; , but at this point I can only guess.
</I>
See? You got it. :-)

&gt;<i> And I am not trying to annoy you. I am just making an investment.
</I>
Good. We (others on #gpsd and me) have invested quite some time to
identify this issue. If we happen to be right and the bug has been
lying around for 15 years as you claim, it may be worth you spend a
bit of yours on reading code. Just saying...


Cheers,
