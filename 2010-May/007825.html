I don't want to respond to every bit you said, so I just grab an example
to highlight my general opinion.

May I remind you that you yourself pointed out that although the measured
numbers are a factor of ten worse for the bad fix, you also pointed out that
in the big picture even the bad case does not make a dent in cpu load.

Your 'cpu tax' issue is well understood. That is the price you pay in select
loops like this. Please also note: the less cpu speed you have, the smaller
the penalty becomes. Please also note: The effect is worst if your cpu is
so fast as to make single byte reads. That is what we do in the serial case
even on low end systems. Last: if you increase the cpu clock your 'tax'
goes up, but it can go only to the worst case: single byte reads, and you
still have a net gain.

This just does not bother me at all.

I just don't see the glaring architectural fault. Unless Eric is concerned
I can only repeat: This just does not bother me at all.

Cheers,
Remco
