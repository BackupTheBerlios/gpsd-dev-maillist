I indeed tried to present fairly both sides of the argument. I'm
afraid &quot;does not make a dent&quot; slightly slips into partisanship
though... :-)

Perhaps i should have underlined in a bolder manner that the above
tests showcased one of the best plausible cases for the current
design.
That is: a buffered (BT in that case) serial port that insures 16
bytes will be there to read at all times (but bi-packet ends). In
fact, it would be slightly slower if it received packets one-at-a-time
-- i can measure it if needed.
But as you mentioned, the standard use-case (hardware serial port)
probably is close to one main() loop per char. How much slower is
that?

Easy enough: let's re-run the 16-bytes test with a max read length of
1 byte. Average CPU times consumed:  37400ms.
Around 163 times slower than the &quot;fast patch&quot;. If we stay on the 10k
packets per 2 hours rate, we're talking about ~1.5% of available CPU
time wasted on my setup -- that would be noticeable with top.

If you take into account that a threaded implementation would do much
better than the &quot;fast patch&quot;, we're talking about an architecture that
is probably 200+ times slower than another. And that is still assuming
two unfair bias in favor of the slow design:
 - there is a single GPS and no clients (the more asynchronous streams
there are, the more the mono-threaded implementation will paddle in
the jelly)
 - you're running gpsd on a single core

Even if we nicely cut the number to 100 times slower, that would still
pretty much mean 99% of the CPU cycles used by gpsd in the claimed
standard use-case is junk. Somehow that gotta hurt.

I suppose there are legitimate rational reasons to willingly go that
much slower. For example: development costs, stability, need to
support this particular thread-less architecture, etc.
In the interest of the discussion, i'd love to hear them clarified --
further than &quot;it does not bother me&quot;. :-)


&gt;<i> Your 'cpu tax' issue is well understood. That is the price you pay in select
</I>&gt;<i> loops like this.
</I>
That's indeed my point: it's the price of &quot;single-threadness&quot;.

&gt;<i> Please also note: the less cpu speed you have, the smaller
</I>&gt;<i> the penalty becomes.
</I>
I'm sorry, this is not a &quot;half-full/half-empty&quot; kind of argument. It's
not a bug you can so easily spin into a feature: as the slow design is
orders of magnitude slower in all cases, the fact that it's a bit less
slower on old hardware is no argument. :-)

But my point here was: not only is it statically sub-efficient, but
also dynamically (in terms of CPU speed and CPU cores). This
suspicious scalability-averse behavior may ring more than a mere
code-aesthetic alarm.

&gt;<i> Last: if you increase the cpu clock your 'tax'
</I>&gt;<i> goes up, but it can go only to the worst case: single byte reads, and you
</I>&gt;<i> still have a net gain.
</I>
Can you develop a bit on what is the basis of this claim?
Somehow, the above numbers push me as far as to suspect gpsd might
actually (and to a certain point) run slower on faster machines...


Cheers,
