I may have missed your point, but just in case i did not express
myself clearly i'll rephrase: i believe the most efficient is to
attempt to read as much as we can (iow as much as can fit in
inbuffer), as the current implementation does.
Spinning a main loop every 16 bytes is less (or equally, depending on
the context) efficient.
(I have the bad feeling there's a misunderstanding going on here :p).

</I>
That's true. Although &quot;good enough&quot; is a rather subjective threshold,
isn't it?  ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> Here's a (admittedly quick and dirty, yet a starting) patch that does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it: <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/nQ0wQ5XU">http://pastebin.com/nQ0wQ5XU</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I support moving the bulk of the code out of main even if there were
</I>&gt;<i> not another reason to do it. I like the process() function.
</I>&gt;<i> I am scared of possible side effects, but that is what q/a is for.
</I>
A very reasonable scare, as far as i can tell. :)
It works in my use-case, but i wouldn't bet much on it working in every cases.
Actually, i believe this difficulty kind of proves my &quot;design&quot; point:
it shouldn't be that hard to foresee the consequences of such a
change, should it?
This being said the ugliness of my patch shows i'm able to go for the
good enough too (now it works and i can go back to the little project
that brought me here in the first place). ;)

&gt;<i> I don't like what it does to packet_get().
</I>
Me neither. I'm so scared of changing its interface that i hacked it
as un-intrusively as i could.
The &quot;return 1;&quot; is particularly bad. Yet i have to return at this
point in case there is just an incomplete packet in the backlog, and
no available tty. And if i return anything&lt;=1 /dev/rfcom0 gets closed
by gps_poll.
The return value of packet_get() is quite a thing in itself anyway. ;-)
