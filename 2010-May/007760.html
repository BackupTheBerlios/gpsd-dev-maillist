I'm sorry, i think i explained it the best i could. Perhaps someone
else can do better?
Anyhow, i believe you'd get it if you spent roughly as much time
trying as you've spent writing this answer (no irony intended).

Anything that is returned by packet_get() [packet.c:1639]. More
precisely, what's copied in gps_packet_t.outbuffer by packet_accept()
[packet.c:1042] after a successful packet_parse().
In my context: a NMEA sentence.

</I>
What if 3.14 packets have been received over the serial line the next
time you poll for input and read as much of it as you can
[packet.c:1646]?

&gt;<i> Please also address the point why in all the time gpsd is in use nobody has been bitten

</I>
Probably because GPS devices usually send packets one at a time,
slowly enough to let gpsd process them one by one, and regularly
enough to keep the lag small if ever two packets arrived at once.
I've talked about it on #gpsd and i'm definitely not the first one to
experience this kind of bug.

Do you have any proof nobody was ever bitten by this bug?

&gt;<i> Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.

Proofs need people willing to understand them.
