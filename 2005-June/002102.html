<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen was correct to point this out as a bug.  Thankfully, during my
</I>&gt;<i> last re-factoring of the strategy-pattern architecture, I changed the
</I>&gt;<i> driver packet handlers to return exactly the status bits needed to
</I>&gt;<i> dispatch to appropriate raw-hook dump functions.
</I>
There are still issues with this.
I have made a change that now makes it work for TSIP, and repaired the
output for ZODIAC, but I think there is another problem with the
architecture.

This is kind of related to what I posted yesterday.
The gpsd does not seem to have a knowledge about update cycles.  Each
message is handled standalone, and the mask value sets only what that
specific message updates.  The handle_packet routine smacks that in
session-&gt;gpsdata.set and proceeds as if only those values are valid.

However, the typical GPS receiver does not output all its information in a
single message.  Information is sent in &quot;message cycles&quot; which consist of
several different message types that convey different parts of the fix
data.
They often show signs of haphazard design, as you pointed out in a writeup
on the website.
However, they are a fact of life, and we need to handle this in gpsd.

For example, in TSIP the position, velocity, time and DOP data are all
sent in different messages in a cycle.  handle_packet (before my patch)
assumes that DOP values are only sent in message that also contain LATLON,
but this is simply not the case.

As the O= output is sent for every message parsed (as I wrote yesterday),
things are even worse: for every message parsed an O packet is assembled
with different mask flags as a starting point, so O packets are sent with
alternating valid and unknown data in the same position.

I think what should happen is that the mask flags accumulate during a
message cycle and are only reset between cycles.  And of course the O
packet should be sent only after all data for that cycle has been
collected.

What this requires is some detection of the update cycle.  I understand
that you want to keep the latency low (although I do not really see why
this matters so much, given the characteristics of a typical receiver), so
this may not be really simple.  The start of a cycle is probably easier to
find than the end, but sending all data about the previous cycle at that
moment will introduce a 1 second latency.
However, I think something needs to be done, as what happens now is not
very reasonable.
