<PRE>My issue with the header was that there are files that either make
pthread calls or manipulate pthread datatypes, and they can't do that
properly if the headers aren't actually included.

With regard to testing for the library, testing for the header is
dumb. It should be shipped with the library. If pthreads are a
requirement, then I should be able to try -pthread, and maybe look for
the library in a few key places. This will work because a) -pthread
should insulate me from the details, or b) I should be able to link a
sample pthread test after depending on its includes. Can't link = no
libs = busted pthreads. Can't compile = no headers = busted pthreads.
Either way it's a busted development environment, and for all modern
freenixen, that's inexcusable.

Also, I think I should be able to steal a pthread test from someplace
else. I'm sure I've seen some instance of a configure script that does
know about -pthread, -lpthread, -lpthreads, -lpth,... i think it
might've been mysql. Personally, I'm OK with having configure know
where -pthread should be used.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
