<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Now, after upgrading to gpsd 2.26, the date is displayed as:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; D=2036-02-06T15:22:25.00Z
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  which is some 30 years ahead!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Strange that it is not 2038...
</I>&gt;<i> Is this with an NMEA receiver?
</I>
Must be.  I'm certainly not seeing this behavior on my SiRF GPSes.

Wojciech, if you'll send me some NMEA that produces a bad date when 
looped through gpsfake, I should be able to fix this rapidly.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; The disconect/reconnect bug is still there. Gpsd stoped to output data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when left for night even with a client connected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a gpsd with 3 receivers, 3 xgps's and a sirfmon connected and
</I>&gt;<i> it remains alive for days.  But I have seen daemons go haywire on a
</I>&gt;<i> heavy loaded system.  Is your system running a backup during the
</I>&gt;<i> night?  That may be the reason.
</I>
It might well be.  But, Rob, I'm still worried about this.  Right now my 
effort is going to upgrading the session-faking logic in gpsfake so I
can really torture-test the daemon -- throw a bunch of weird patterns of 
client connects and disconnects at it and watch for lockups.

I'm also trying to do a dynamic-allocation audit with valgrind.  I haven't
got far with that; I keep running into technical problems with valgrind itself.

&gt;<i> &gt; Some fields on xgps (Altitude, EPH, EPV, Climb) toggle between something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and n/a. Status toggles between 2D an 3D fix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it needs some work in this area, but Eric wanted to release...
</I>
Correct on both counts.  It had been a month, after all.  The ordinary users
deserved the bug fixes and features that had been piling up.

But, Rob: Wojciech's problem is slightly different from yours and
harder to solve.  Because TSIP identifies itself, the code could in
theory know what the last packet in an update cycle is and suppress
all reports prior to that, if you were willing to accept less than a
second of latency in favor of getting an accumulated report.

This isn't feasible for NMEA devices because we don't in advance know
the sequence of sentences in one cycle.  We can detect *start* of cycle,
but not the end of cycle.  Thus, we can't know when to ship accumulated
fix data until it is obsolete by timestamp.  We have to ship out each
new fragment of NMEA content as it arrives.

xgps is a test client.  It's intended to show developers what the 
daemon is doing, so it doesn't buffer old information but rather 
presents the contents of each O response as it comes up.

Hmmm...I think the FAQ needs an entry on this.
