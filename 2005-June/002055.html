The timezone are defined according to administrative (read &quot;political&quot;) borders:
nation, state and sometime county borders. In order to get the timezone, you must
have a map that contains these administrative borders and then identify where
you are (i.e. under which administrative rule you belong). To each nation/state/county
you can associate a timezone identifier, and then you are in business.

For the US, the US Census Bureau TIGER files contain the necessary information.
I have been more or less dreaming of doing such a thing in RoadMap in the distant future,
but RoadMap is definitively too heavy for just such an usage. Reducing US maps to
administrative borders only would end with a few MB of data, at most. Most other nations
likely belong to only one timezone (the exceptions including Russia and China), so the
national borders from the Digital Charts of the World would be mostly sufficient.

I agree this is not going to be simple.. The good news is, these borders don't change
that often..
