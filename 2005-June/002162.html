<PRE>&gt;<i> Once Rob sends the (no doubt trivial) patch that adds CYCLE_START_SET
</I>&gt;<i> setting to the TSIP driver, it will be possible to do all the policy
</I>&gt;<i> logic we want in libgpsd_core.c:handle_packet().
</I>
It was not as trivial as you think...   I reconnected the Trimble and
found it would no longer get a fix.  It turns out that since the changes
in handle_packet, a fix can only be obtained when TIME_SET is returned in
most packets.  If not, sentence_time will be cleared soon and only O=? Y=?
will be returned.

Hopefully your policy logic will be in place soon...

I have added TIME_SET flags and now it works.
I do not understand the real difference between fix.time and
sentence_time.  Normally they are set together.  Probably one was intended
to be the fix timestamp and the other the arrival time, but this no longer
seems true.
At first I had only set the TIME_SET flag when reliable time was received
(the GPS Time message).
