<PRE>After meditating on Rob Janssen's suggestions for a while, I think I
have figured out how to clean up the data-accumulation logic considerably.
I have had two insights about this:

1. The whole mess about which sentences comes first in an NMEA GPS
cycle was a distraction.  We don't need to care.  All we care about is
when the GPS is telling us the existing fix data is stale -- which it
does by changing the timestamp it ships.

2. Start-of-cycle is a packet property that different drivers must set
in different ways.  NMEA drivers can look for a fresh timestamp.  For
drivers like SiRF, Zodiac, and Garmin that send all fix information in
a single timestamped packet, the start-of-cycle property goes on that
packet.  For drivers like TSIP that return fix data in multiple
messages with a known sequence, the start-of-cycle property should be
set on the the first packet in the sequence.

This is not just theory.  svn head now has code to support a new mask
bit, CYCLE_START_SET.  Each driver is expected to pass this back in
its parse return for any sentence that (a) contains timestamped fix data,
and (b) is the *first* such sentence in each update cycle.

I have implemented this flag in the NMEA, SiRF, Garmin, and Zodiac
drivers. Driver maintainers, please eyeball this and check my 
assumptions.

I have not tried to implement this in the TSIP driver.  Rob, please
send a patch that does this.

All drivers have been modified to drop packet information into
a new structure member.  The merge into old fix data is now
explicit, and done after the packet parser is called.  

This change and the CYCLE_START_SET flag put the tools in place
for us to experiment with either a report-per-packet or an
accumulating strategy.  No timeouts are involved!

Once Rob sends the (no doubt trivial) patch that adds CYCLE_START_SET
setting to the TSIP driver, it will be possible to do all the policy
logic we want in libgpsd_core.c:handle_packet().

Accordingly, I'm postponing the 2.26 release for two days.

The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and
hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series
of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.		-- H.L. Mencken
