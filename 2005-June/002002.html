Actually, while testing a bluetooth gps I had to go back to an old (and I 
mean old) version to reliably keep getting data. Things have improved (it 
was a month or so ago now) but I got the point of his bug, namely, firing 
all these releases which keep being crippled in various ways is annoying. 
Beta versions or an unstable series (and if it is, say so), fine.

If you push your luck, you may lose such people. This is not meant as an 
ominous statement, just a reflection of what I've seen elsewhere.
