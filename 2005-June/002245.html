&gt;<i> I never considered dynamic memory allocation part of this problem...
</I>&gt;<i> I think there is some serial data loss, the state machine gets out of
</I>&gt;<i> sync, and it does not capture sync anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> But how that can happen is not very clear to me.  Originally there was an
</I>&gt;<i> issue with the code that is now in function character_discard.  But I
</I>&gt;<i> think that code is OK now.
</I>
Not clear to me how it could happen either, at least not in any way specific
to the SiRF-packet code.  The way all six of the state machines are written
is that when they see an unexpected character they go to GROUND_STATE, 
which completely resets the state machine.  It should then just merrily
chew through any garbage until it sees another packet header.  

I deliberately chose an approach that is brutally stupid but very robust
(as opposed, say, to some fancy Boyer-Moore-like parallel-recognition thingy).
Maybe there's a way to permanantly lose sync with a design
like this, but if so I sure have not been able to imagine it.  And I've
been trying.

I've be more inclined to believe that the machinery behind FIONREAD ioctl is 
somehow getting confused because a resource crisis has done something nasty
to the serial layer's clist management (or whatever Linux's equivalent
of clist management is).  Maybe it's getting into a condition where the
main loop spins out of cpontrol because the ioctl() instantly returns
0 or -1 whenever called?
