You call that a Fix?
I call it a change to the code without first investigating the possible
problem.
Like so many of the past weeks 'Fixes'.

In my opionion, you are not correctly handling the tool that has been
given to you.  You use it as a machine gun to hit the target, because that
is easier than using bow and arrow.

But the overal quality of the project is going down the drain.
When some warning is given about a datatype, you are not investigating the
proper type of the data and making sure that all variables and function
parameters agree to that type, but you merely insert a typecast at the
place of the warning.

Surely that is going to get the number of warnings down, but it is not
going to change anything to the quality of the code.  Because the compiler
already  performed those casts automatically.

But what you do get is bugs as the result of subtle changes that have more
impact than you oversee at first.

As I have other things to do at the moment, I am not going to spend my
time on exhaustive tests to see if the code is still correct after changes
to make splint happy, only to find the next day that the strategy has
again changed (and a new variant of the getx macros is tried, again
incorrect).

My opinion is and remains that a checking tool should be used as a
guideline to evaluate possible problems in the code, then investigate a
solution for those problems (like using a different datatype), and finally
implement that solution throughout the code and see some warnings
disappear.

What I see happening now is just &quot;hey the tool says I put an unsigned int
into a signed int parameter so let's insert (int) here&quot;.  That is not the
way to do it.

The changes around gps_week are a very good example for this.  Should it
be an int, an unsigned int, a short, an unsigned short?  THAT should be
decided first.  THEN all instances should be changed to that type.
And the inclusion of the member into the gps_device structure should be
based on actual facts, not anecdotes about errors seen.
The member is only referenced in tsip.c so  if a #ifdef TSIP_ENABLE does
not work to isolate it, there is a global problem, not something that is
solved by putting some more terms into the #ifdef.
