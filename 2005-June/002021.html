<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; You convinced me a week ago that the result of getword has to be short-cast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to get the signedness right.  Those casts *are* being done at the point of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; call, everywhere.  So the generated code is precisely as if the internal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; short cast were present, except for the getlong expansion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Must be in some version that you did not put in svn then.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see any of these casts in the trunk sirf.c
</I>
I'll look at svn head.  That was just before I headed for Brazil; it
is just possible I'm out of sync somehow.

&gt;<i> &gt; I agree, and would go further.  I'm thinking these ought no longer to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be macros, I think we ought to have a little module specifically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; devoted to these so that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a) the code for them can be shared across drivers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (b) the module can have its own unit test as you propose above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This can be accomplished by putting the macros in some include file as well.
</I>&gt;<i> I like macros better than function calls because the parameter is usually
</I>&gt;<i> constant, something a function cannot know.  A good compiler could handle
</I>&gt;<i> it with inline functions, but inline functions are not a standard part of
</I>&gt;<i> the language.
</I>
Fair point about propagating constants.  I'm not worried about the
nonportability of inline, for reasons I'll explain if we decide
it matters.

&gt;<i> A function also cannot access the local buf, which means it would need to
</I>&gt;<i> be global or passed as yet another parameter to every call.
</I>
I actually think this would be good.  Explicit is better than implicit.
Someday, that implicit argument *will* be overlooked and cause a bug.
I think the macros should have a buffer argument and have come close
to making this change twice.

What is the state of the TSIP driver?

I'm asking because, if it's OK, then that means our only pending bugs
are in the SiRF driver (speed bug at 2561, altitude at 2572), and the
best way out of this jungle would probably be the following steps:

1. I revert sirf.c to rev level 2560, last known good version.  

2. Andreas tests to make sure it's still OK compiled with the 
   rest of the svn head code.

3. You abstract out the macros into a bits.h file and tweak tsip.c to
   use them.  (Optionally, you split them into signed-unsigned pairs
   at this point.)

4. You test tsip.c to make sure it hasn't broken.

5. I splint-clean sirf.c without touching the macros.

6. Andreas tests the result to make sure I haven't broken speed
   or altitude.

7. *Then*, if necessary, you and I look at the macros again and try to
   make them splint-clean, moving very carefully and together.

(I've designated Andreas the tester because we *know* we can elicit
these bugs in his environment.)

Does this sound like a good plan?
