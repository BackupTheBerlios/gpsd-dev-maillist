<PRE>speed bug introduced in revision 2561
altitude bug in revision 2572

i believe they're bugs in the sirf code as they didn't occur when
disabling sirf which spawned another compile-option bug (see below)

is it a wanted behavior that when a SiRF-device is set to NMEA, gpsd
tries switching it back to SiRF? (i tried setting NMEA to test for bugs
but gpsd always switched back to sirf).. while it may be a good thing,
in this case it wasn't wanted.

the other thing i stumbled upon (happening in svn HEAD (rev. 2579))
./configure --disable-sirfII
tsip.c: In function `tsip_analyze':
tsip.c:169: error: structure has no member named `gps_week'
tsip.c:240: error: structure has no member named `gps_week'
tsip.c:242: error: structure has no member named `gps_week'
tsip.c:282: error: structure has no member named `gps_week'
tsip.c:362: error: structure has no member named `gps_week'
tsip.c:364: error: structure has no member named `gps_week'
tsip.c:395: error: structure has no member named `last_request'
tsip.c:402: error: structure has no member named `last_request'
make[1]: *** [tsip.lo] Error 1

--disable-sirfII only works when also specifying --disable-tsip

hope that helps.. took me some time ;)
