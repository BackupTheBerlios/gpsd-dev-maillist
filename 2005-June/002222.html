</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, I think many applications would prefer not to bother with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buffering.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  It would be best when gpsd somehow does this, and xgps shows stable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without its own buffering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The daemon is the wrong place for it, I think.  Suppose some clients want
</I>&gt;<i> buffering but others want minimum latency?  Seems to me that would be
</I>&gt;<i> best handled in the client library.
</I>
IMHO, the way the data is shipped now by the daemon (everyting in a single
packet) suggests that it is a complete set.  A ? in a single location
infers that the value in that location has gone from known to unknown.
If you buffer at the client side, there is no real way to know (for each
separate value) whether the receiver has announced that a certain value is
no longer valid. So you need to solely rely upon timeouts.
When you do the buffering at the daemon side, you can (depending on the
receiver protocol in use) more or less quickly communicate any &quot;unknown&quot;
status to the client.
For really purist clients there could be a command to &quot;turn off buffering&quot;.

Of course the data sent from daemon to client should have been in the form
of keyed, not positional, parameters so you can communicate a change in
location without inferring that you no longer know its accuracy (for
example).
With such a protocol, buffering at the client side would be much easier
and you would not lose any info.  Sending eph=? would be different from
not sending an eph at all.
