<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The method to trigger this is caused by a Linux problem that I think is

</I>&gt;<i> Interesting.  That might well explain why you are the only person to
</I>&gt;<i> report
</I>&gt;<i> it. Most of our users are probably using ext3.
</I>
I'm not sure it only happens with Reiserfs.  I have a Linux-powered
appliance (a satellite receiver with harddisk recorder) that uses ext3 and
it seems to have a similar problem.
When you have a system with ext3 maybe you could do a test to see if it at
least performs similar to what I see.  You need a system with 2 disks, of
&quot;modern&quot; size (say 20GB or more).  One disk has a lot of files on it
(preferably in not too small files), the other has space.

Then you do something like:

cp -a * /disk2

or

tar cf /disk2/backup.tar.gz .

or

rsync -a * /disk2

well, anything that makes it read several gigabytes of data and write it
to another disk.
while this is running, look at &quot;top&quot; to see if the system is swapping, and
if it starts feeling sluggish.  in extreme cases (like on my system) it
will become that slow that you will have trouble moving focus from window
to window, and obtaining even character echo in a terminal window.

the &quot;load average&quot; reported by Linux is high, but that value is buggy
because Linux counts processes waiting for disk I/O completion as loading
the system.  the actual CPU load is low, at least when you have DMA disks.
