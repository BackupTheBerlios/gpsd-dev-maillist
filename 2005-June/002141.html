<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> So, if anything: it is probably happening in the SiRF driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which raises the interesting question of why I've never seen it.
</I>
Maybe because you use USB and I use RS232.
It may well be that I get overruns under high load that would not occur on
USB, or that would be handled differently.

&gt;&gt;<i> Today I backed up with SiRF+Zodiac running and the gpsd just crashed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of hogging the CPU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh.  That's *good*. If you can reproduce this, maybe looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> crash point will give us some clues.
</I>
Of course the process is just gone without a trace.  When it would loop, I
could still look what it is doing.
I sort of remember that when it happened before, it was rapidly calling
the FIONREAD ioctl.  But I may confuse this with the autobaud problem that
was also causing a CPU hog.


The method to trigger this is caused by a Linux problem that I think is
mainly visible with Reiserfs, but I am not sure.  For years I am using
SuSE linux and they like Reiserfs, so it has been the default FS on many
systems I administer.
What I observe is: when you copy many gigabytes of data from disk to disk,
the kernel's buffer management goes completely haywire.  The copy
operation is reading and writing many files, and the kernel tries to
buffer as much filedata as possible, even to the point where it starts to
swap out most of the running applications to get more memory available for
buffers.
I think this is caused both by allocation of many buffers for reading
files, and by accumulation of many dirty buffers that still have to be
written.
At some point, programs like gpsd (but also all interactive programs and
the X display manager) come to a complete standstill while the system is
swapping like mad.
(of course the swap partition is on one of the disks involved in the copy,
so swapping really does not help things in this case, it only slows down
the system)

I have 1GB of RAM and 2GB of swap.  Today I checked during the big copy,
and 600MB of swapspace was in use.  Right now I have the same set of
programs running and free says:

             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1035776     804456     231320          0      50216     463384
-/+ buffers/cache:     290856     744920
Swap:      2104440          0    2104440

So 1GB is plenty of RAM, and that copy could easily use 256MB of buffers
without running the system into trouble.  But for some reason it likes to
take 800MB and everything runs into trouble.
