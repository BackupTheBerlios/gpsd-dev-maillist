<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>
&gt;<i> No.  The outer check for LATLON_VALID is there because that code exists to
</I>&gt;<i> interpolate certain values if we (a) now have a fix, and (b) had a fix
</I>&gt;<i> last
</I>&gt;<i> cycle.  The outer check ensures condition (a).
</I>
But that never worked, because LATLON_VALID does not indicate that we have
a fix, it only indicates that this message includes a lat/lon (hopefully
valid).
For example, a TSIP message 4a or 84 gives you a lat/lon/alt but it does
not tell you much about the status of the fix.  That info is passed in
message 6d.

So I changed it.  But now it was reported that the Garmin driver broke, so
probably there is still a problem in this area.


&gt;<i> OK, the answer to these questions is that the code was poorly organized.
</I>&gt;<i> I have now changed it so that the O response builder relies only on the
</I>&gt;<i> the *_NOT_VALID out-of-band values.  Interpretation of the *_SET flags
</I>&gt;<i> takes place in handle_packet() and sometimes pokes these out-of-band
</I>&gt;<i> values into the gpsdata structure.
</I>
The new version is worse.  It clears data immediately when certain flags
are not set.  But that should not happen because we want to accumulate
data over a cycle.
New data must be copied and calculated when flags are set, but it must
only be reset to _NOT_VALID when indications arrive that the data is not
valid (e.g. &quot;no fix&quot;), or when no updates arrive for some time (a cycle,
or for some data even a longer period of several cycles).

This is precisely the problem with the architecture that I try to explain,
but now it has become more visible: the flags status of the last received
messages is treated as describing the current data validity state, while
in fact it only describes what was received in the last message.  This
does not work in cases where data is received in cycles consisting of
multiple messages.
