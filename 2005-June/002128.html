<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; No.  The outer check for LATLON_VALID is there because that code exists to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpolate certain values if we (a) now have a fix, and (b) had a fix
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last cycle.  The outer check ensures condition (a).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But that never worked, because LATLON_VALID does not indicate that we have
</I>&gt;<i> a fix, it only indicates that this message includes a lat/lon (hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> valid).
</I>&gt;<i> For example, a TSIP message 4a or 84 gives you a lat/lon/alt but it does
</I>&gt;<i> not tell you much about the status of the fix.  That info is passed in
</I>&gt;<i> message 6d.
</I>
OK, fair enough.  I was being misled by my SiRF experience.  Changing
the test to (session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.mode &gt;= MODE_2D) should fix that.  I will
also add a note to the Hacker's Guide that driver writers need to
ensure that gpsdata.fix.mode is set properly to indicate fix validity
after each message.
 
&gt;<i> So I changed it.  But now it was reported that the Garmin driver broke, so
</I>&gt;<i> probably there is still a problem in this area.
</I>
I suspect that one is unrelated, actually.  Unfortunately, lacking a 
Garmin regression test, there is little I can do to address it.  Gary,
have you run a trace on this yet?

&gt;<i> &gt; OK, the answer to these questions is that the code was poorly organized.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have now changed it so that the O response builder relies only on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the *_NOT_VALID out-of-band values.  Interpretation of the *_SET flags
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; takes place in handle_packet() and sometimes pokes these out-of-band
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; values into the gpsdata structure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The new version is worse.  It clears data immediately when certain flags
</I>&gt;<i> are not set.  But that should not happen because we want to accumulate
</I>&gt;<i> data over a cycle.
</I>
Did you read the comment that says &quot;Thus, we never clear 2D or 3D
position data here unless the mode has gone from 3D to 2D.&quot;?  I just
added (or lower)&quot; to clarify it.  So position data does in fact 
accumulate over a cycle, and is cleared only when a mode change 
invalidates it.  If this is different than you intention, tell me how.

In any case, the real purpose of that change was to make sure that the
logic for any whole-cycle data aggregation we do is in only one place
and can be understood and modified as a unit.  

There is property of the current code that *I* am unhappy with.  I don't
like having policy choices wired this deeply into libgpsd_core.c.  I'm
looking for a way to fix that.

&gt;<i> New data must be copied and calculated when flags are set, but it must
</I>&gt;<i> only be reset to _NOT_VALID when indications arrive that the data is not
</I>&gt;<i> valid (e.g. &quot;no fix&quot;), or when no updates arrive for some time (a cycle,
</I>&gt;<i> or for some data even a longer period of several cycles).
</I>
I am open to argument about how the velocity data should be handled.
I'm hostile to retaining data *between* cycles, though.  That strikes 
me as lying about what the GPS is actually saying.

&gt;<i> This is precisely the problem with the architecture that I try to explain,
</I>&gt;<i> but now it has become more visible: the flags status of the last received
</I>&gt;<i> messages is treated as describing the current data validity state, while
</I>&gt;<i> in fact it only describes what was received in the last message.  This
</I>&gt;<i> does not work in cases where data is received in cycles consisting of
</I>&gt;<i> multiple messages.
</I>
You are right.  But what you consider a problem, I consider being honest
about what the GPS is *actually saying*.  I'm vary wary of any design that
might lead users to take stale data as authoritative.  Thus, whenever 
anyone says &quot;timeouts&quot;, my hackles rise.

I am glad we are having this discussion.  The outcome should be a set of
well-defined, principled rules for data lifetimes that we can both
embody in code and document.
