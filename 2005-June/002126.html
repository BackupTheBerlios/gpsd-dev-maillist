&gt;<i> ... but I am not so sure why that check was there in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> The DOP_SET flags were only looked at inside an if statement that checked
</I>&gt;<i> for LATLON_SET so they were only handled when both latitude/longitude and
</I>&gt;<i> DOP appeared in the same message, which they don't for a Trimble receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there is some other receiver where the DOP values are invalid when
</I>&gt;<i> there is no latitude/longitude and that is why that check was made?
</I>
No.  The outer check for LATLON_VALID is there because that code exists to
interpolate certain values if we (a) now have a fix, and (b) had a fix last
cycle.  The outer check ensures condition (a).

&gt;<i> The check is still around the SPEEDERR and CLIMBERR checks, do you want to
</I>&gt;<i> say that it can be removed there as well?
</I>&gt;<i> (I did not want to do that as it seems to save state, including lat/lon,
</I>&gt;<i> from the previous fix)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the problems is that part of the O line builder uses _NOT_VALID
</I>&gt;<i> values (which *are* saved across GPS message boundaries), and part uses
</I>&gt;<i> _SET  indicators (which only refer to the last received message),
</I>&gt;<i> The latter causes the toggling of valid/invalid data.
</I>&gt;<i> But of course the former means that sometimes data is present in the
</I>&gt;<i> message that is obtained from a previous message cycle, and thus from a
</I>&gt;<i> previous fix.
</I>
OK, the answer to these questions is that the code was poorly organized.
I have now changed it so that the O response builder relies only on the
the *_NOT_VALID out-of-band values.  Interpretation of the *_SET flags
takes place in handle_packet() and sometimes pokes these out-of-band
values into the gpsdata structure.

I've also added more explanatory comments to the section in handle_packet
that controls how and when data is retained.  They are intended to answer
the kinds of questions you are raising.   

Review and criticize, please.  This code is kind of nasty; I wouldn't be
astonished if there are subtle bugs in it.
