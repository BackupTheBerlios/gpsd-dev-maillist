<PRE>The current list of to-do items for 2.27 is, as previously noted

1) We need Reiserfs torture results from Rob
2) We need a Garmin fix from Gary.

But there are a couple of other possible issues.  Daryl Ross &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">spam at afoyi.com</A>&gt;
has reported some problems with his SiRF-based GPSes under 2.26.  These are
as follows:

* Approximately 10-second lag in reporting fixes in binary mode only

I can't duplicate this.  I tried watching both my cellphone clock and
the GPS timestamps through xgps; they seem to be perfectly in sync. 
We've had reports like this before which generally had to do with
leap-second correction or lack of same; I wonder if this one just
means Darryl's GPS hasn't picked up its first leap correction yet.

* Speed reports cap at about 30MPH even when he's doing 60.

I can't duplicate this either.  Can anybody?  He's using a BU303.

* gpsd fails to reconnect to a GPS after the first time it's released.

This one really puzzles me.  I use a BU303 as one of my primary test
devices and I have *never* seen this.  Can anyone come up with any
theory about a site- or OS-specific bug that could produce this?

I've asked Darryl for a packet log exhibiting the speed problem,
but received no reply.

&quot;Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.  Suspect every one
who approaches that jewel.  Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it
but downright force.  Whenever you give up that force, you are
inevitably ruined.&quot;	-- Patrick Henry, speech of June 5 1788
