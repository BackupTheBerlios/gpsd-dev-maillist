<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; I remain concerned about Rob Janssen's report of possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state-machine lockups in the presence of heavy disk activity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This weekend I reformatted the backupdrive in ext2 and made another
</I>&gt;<i> backup.  It did not happen.  I think the writing characteristics of
</I>&gt;<i> reiserfs are an essential part of getting this triggered.
</I>
Good to know.  I have added a note to this effect in the TODO.

&gt;<i> &gt; I expect Rob will be working on fixing the PPS code.  Odds are this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a pthreads bug that will have to be worked around.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I have to dive into the pthreads manual, unless an expert here can
</I>&gt;<i> tell me if a thread exit could close an fd that has been opened in the
</I>&gt;<i> parent and just got cloned into the child thread and is not explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> closed there.
</I>
Alas, I am not such an expert.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; The known TSIP driver problems are still annoying but can still be lived
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the TSIP driver has no problems of its own anymore, it just
</I>&gt;<i> suffers a bit from the current state of the data management.  So when that
</I>&gt;<i> gets tuned up, the TSIP driver should work OK.
</I>
I think you're right.  Added:

    This may be a symptom of more general problems in data management
    on devices that ship several sentences of fix and related data
    per cycle.

One more note: as a result of my investigations into dynamic-memory
behavior I am now pretty confident that your Reiserfs lockup is not
specifically related to the SiRF code.  Because, as it turns out, there is
very little dynamic memory allocation going on in the daemon and none at all
in the SiRF driver.  In fact, this is all of it:

garmin.c:618:	    session-&gt;GarminBuffer = calloc( sizeof(Packet_t), 1);
libgpsd_core.c:65:    struct gps_device_t *session = (struct gps_device_t *)calloc(sizeof(struct gps_device_t), 1);
libgpsd_core.c:70:    session-&gt;gpsdata.gps_device = strdup(device);

Both of the libgpsd_core.c instances are in gpsd_init(), so they only
fire when a GPS session is being initialized.
