<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> It is because eph and epv are part of the fix structure.
</I>&gt;<i> So, when CYCLE_START_SET is set the values of eph and epv are cleared and
</I>&gt;<i> they are only recalculated when a packet containing DOP comes in.  This
</I>&gt;<i> does not happen every cycle but only every 5 seconds.  So most of the time
</I>&gt;<i> the eph and epv are shown as n/a.
</I>
I've checked in a change that may fix this.  What I've done is put DOP
computation from the satellite picture in the policy code, overridden by 
whatever DOP reports the driver actually ships.  Previously, this
had only been done for the SiRF driver.
 
&gt;<i> In the meantime I have many other problems with this receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> When I telnet and type R the driver segfaults on sending the NMEA string.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While initializing it has trouble getting the correct baudrate.  This has
</I>&gt;<i> always been difficult (because the receiver sends little data when idling)
</I>&gt;<i> but now it has become difficult to get it synced.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it is caused by my changes, I have to check again.
</I>
I hope you'll continue to work on these.  But if TSIP is the only driver
having problems -- and from the reports I'm getting, it seems to be --
then it's time to ship this sucker.

I'm going to go off and investigate my one other pending bug report now,
If I can resolve that and pass the regression tests, 2.26 willl go out.
