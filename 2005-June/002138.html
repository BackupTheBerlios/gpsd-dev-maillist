<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The new version is worse.  It clears data immediately when certain flags
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not set.  But that should not happen because we want to accumulate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data over a cycle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you read the comment that says &quot;Thus, we never clear 2D or 3D
</I>&gt;<i> position data here unless the mode has gone from 3D to 2D.&quot;?  I just
</I>&gt;<i> added (or lower)&quot; to clarify it.  So position data does in fact
</I>&gt;<i> accumulate over a cycle, and is cleared only when a mode change
</I>&gt;<i> invalidates it.  If this is different than you intention, tell me how.
</I>
I am referring to statements like this in handle_packet:
    if ((session-&gt;gpsdata.set &amp; TIME_SET)==0)
        session-&gt;gpsdata.sentence_time = TIME_NOT_VALID;
    if ((session-&gt;gpsdata.set &amp; SPEED_SET)==0)
        session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.speed = SPEED_NOT_VALID;
    if ((session-&gt;gpsdata.set &amp; TRACK_SET)==0)
        session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.track = TRACK_NOT_VALID;
    if ((session-&gt;gpsdata.set &amp; CLIMB_SET)==0)
        session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.climb = SPEED_NOT_VALID;

Those immediately invalidate this data when a packet arrives that does not
have that specific flag set.  But sometimes receivers send packets that do
not set those flags, but it is not good to clear out all those values.
(for example, I have debug packets enabled in my SiRF receiver and it
sends regular  0xff packets)

&gt;<i> In any case, the real purpose of that change was to make sure that the
</I>&gt;<i> logic for any whole-cycle data aggregation we do is in only one place
</I>&gt;<i> and can be understood and modified as a unit.
</I>
The idea of aggregation is OK but it should have a memory of one cycle,
not one packet.
This will of course always be difficult when the daemon has no idea about
cycles.

When you don't want a timeout for each separate value (which makes things
complicated), I think the least that can be done is to have a detection of
timestamp change.  handle_packet should somehow detect that the timestamp
has changed (maybe only check the integral part to cover those receivers
that change the timestamp for each message?) and when that occurs wipe out
all old information?

I think the fix data will have to be double-buffered in this case.
Move all fix data into a single structure (part is already in there),
define two of those structures in the device struct, and let the parser
write in one of them and the handle_packet move the data to the second
struct.
(it will have to be verified that no drivers write data without setting
the corresponding flag).
handle_packet can first check if there is time difference between the
parsed data and the accumulated data, and if so it can wipe the
accumulated data.  Then it proceeds to copy the newly parsed data into the
accumulated data, and calculate any derivatives.
Of course the O output is built from the accumulated data.  Preferably
after the last message from a cycle that builds it has been parsed.
A convenient point to do that is just before it is wiped because of a
timestamp change.  Then you certainly have a consistent set of data, but
it of course introduces a latency.

This way the data accumulates during a cycle but old data cannot remain.
Of course, a different (longer) cycle has to be defined for SV visibility
info.
