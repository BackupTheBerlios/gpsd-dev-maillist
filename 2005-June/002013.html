<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; I just read Rob Janssen's upset screed about my latest commit.  I then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lost it due to a glitch related to my somewhat jerry-rigged
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arrangement for reading mail on the road.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In one respect, Rob simply has his facts wrong.  That change to sirf.c
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not a random twitch in an unexplored direction.  Allowing for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rename of the macros, it simply reverts them to an earlier state that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is known good -- I used Andreas Brauchli's information that revision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2560 is the last one without a speed bug.  Thus, this code has already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been thoroughly &quot;investigated&quot; in Rob's sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh NO!
</I>&gt;<i> I thought we had hashed this out a week or so ago.
</I>
We did.  I believe you are misinterpreting the situation.  Please bear
in mind that I reverted to a a version Andreas reported as *known good*.
Also bear in mind that this is not a change I made to keep splint quiet.
 
&gt;<i> I am still running the last version before splint.  When I do a diff, I
</I>&gt;<i> see the following change in sirf.c:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 102,104c109,111
</I>&gt;<i> &lt; #define getb(off)     (buf[off])
</I>&gt;<i> &lt; #define getw(off)     ((short)((getb(off) &lt;&lt; 8) | getb(off+1)))
</I>&gt;<i> &lt; #define getl(off)     ((int)((getw(off) &lt;&lt; 16) | (getw(off+2) &amp; 0xffff)))
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #define getbyte(off)  buf[off]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #define getword(off)  ((getbyte(off) &lt;&lt; 8) | getbyte(off+1))
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #define getlong(off)  ((int)((getword(off) &lt;&lt; 16) | (getword(off+2) &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> 0xffff))
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is just wrong!  The (short) cast in getw or getword is REQUIRED.
</I>&gt;<i> I have explained that, and I am not going to continue to explain that over
</I>&gt;<i> and over again.
</I>
You convinced me a week ago that the result of getword has to be short-cast
to get the signedness right.  Those casts *are* being done at the point of 
call, everywhere.  So the generated code is precisely as if the internal
short cast were present, except for the getlong expansion.

&gt;<i> I have installed splint and I am not impressed by it.  It warns about
</I>&gt;<i> things that are just plain silly to warn about, like assigning the NULL
</I>&gt;<i> value to a pointer (why would that be wrong??) or comparing an unsigned
</I>&gt;<i> char to a small constant integer.  I also find it extremely lacking that
</I>&gt;<i> it does not parse the system includefiles to pickup types.
</I>&gt;<i> The author of this tool is of the typical &quot;I wished that C would be
</I>&gt;<i> Pascal&quot; type, who did not carefully study the basics of the C language. 
</I>&gt;<i> What you are doing by eradicating warnings is just massaging the source to
</I>&gt;<i> his likings, not improving the quality in a general sense.
</I>
I disagree.  I have found five real bugs with it, four of which I have
fixed and one of which is still pending (a word vs. longword problem in
a function return type -- could be a problem on weird architectures).

I expect to find more bugs now that I am down to less than a hundred 
warnings that are almost all concerned with possible memory leaks and
allocation problems.

&gt;<i> To come back to the above macros: they are not sacred.  I see some room
</I>&gt;<i> for improvement.  But they were carefully designed, and they do work.  In
</I>&gt;<i> the original version.
</I>&gt;<i> When splint is issuing warnings about them, you could make modifications. 
</I>&gt;<i> But I object to modifications that destroy the functionality (and thus
</I>&gt;<i> introduce bugs) just because they make splint happy.
</I>
Of course that's a wrong thing to do.

&gt;<i> Before you try your next modification, I would suggest that you write a
</I>&gt;<i> test program, that does getx calls on a buffer that you fill with some
</I>&gt;<i> testdata.  Use testvalues that provide you with some info, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 0102030405060708
</I>&gt;<i> FFFEFDFCFBFAF9F8
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See if your &quot;improved&quot; macro still returns the same value when accessing
</I>&gt;<i> this data.  Yours don't, and it shows as problems that you don't notice
</I>&gt;<i> every time (because values are more often positive than negative).
</I>
This test is a good idea.  
 
&gt;<i> In hindsight, it would have been better to have separate macros for signed
</I>&gt;<i> and unsigned results.  This makes the list longer:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> getsb
</I>&gt;<i> getub
</I>&gt;<i> getsw
</I>&gt;<i> getuw
</I>&gt;<i> getsl
</I>&gt;<i> getul
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but it would allow the removal of some of the casts in the code.  The
</I>&gt;<i> unsigned variants would also be more suitable to build the getl in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of getw etc.
</I>
I agree, and would go further.  I'm thinking these ought no longer to
be macros, I think we ought to have a little module specifically
devoted to these so that

(a) the code for them can be shared across drivers
(b) the module can have its own unit test as you propose above.

There isn't really a lot of point to them being macros except to inline
the code, and I don't see a lot of gain in that.  A few dozen more
function call-return sequences aren't going to hit the performance
of the drivers enough to matter.

&gt;<i> The macros would have to be carefully coded again, and the entire binary
</I>&gt;<i> drivers again need to be checked against the manufacturers docs to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that the macro used agrees with the type of value in the message
</I>&gt;<i> (signed or unsigned).
</I>&gt;<i> The datatypes used to store the result, and the parameters specified for
</I>&gt;<i> functions, should match as closely as possible with these types.
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. when &quot;gps week&quot; is an unsigned, it should not be passed to
</I>&gt;<i> gpstime_to_unix as an int)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I am not going to do that in an environment as it exists now.
</I>
OK.  What would we have to do to make you willing to do it?

You have demonstrated that you understand the cross-platform issues 
with sign extension better than I do.  I think you should write the
unit test for the new data-extraction functions.
