<PRE>&gt;<i> I just read Rob Janssen's upset screed about my latest commit.  I then
</I>&gt;<i> lost it due to a glitch related to my somewhat jerry-rigged
</I>&gt;<i> arrangement for reading mail on the road.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In one respect, Rob simply has his facts wrong.  That change to sirf.c
</I>&gt;<i> is not a random twitch in an unexplored direction.  Allowing for the
</I>&gt;<i> rename of the macros, it simply reverts them to an earlier state that
</I>&gt;<i> is known good -- I used Andreas Brauchli's information that revision
</I>&gt;<i> 2560 is the last one without a speed bug.  Thus, this code has already
</I>&gt;<i> been thoroughly &quot;investigated&quot; in Rob's sense.

Oh NO!
I thought we had hashed this out a week or so ago.

I am still running the last version before splint.  When I do a diff, I
see the following change in sirf.c:

102,104c109,111
&lt; #define getb(off)     (buf[off])
&lt; #define getw(off)     ((short)((getb(off) &lt;&lt; 8) | getb(off+1)))
&lt; #define getl(off)     ((int)((getw(off) &lt;&lt; 16) | (getw(off+2) &amp; 0xffff)))
---
&gt;<i> #define getbyte(off)  buf[off]
</I>&gt;<i> #define getword(off)  ((getbyte(off) &lt;&lt; 8) | getbyte(off+1))
</I>&gt;<i> #define getlong(off)  ((int)((getword(off) &lt;&lt; 16) | (getword(off+2) &amp;
</I>0xffff))

That is just wrong!  The (short) cast in getw or getword is REQUIRED.
I have explained that, and I am not going to continue to explain that over
and over again.

I have installed splint and I am not impressed by it.  It warns about
things that are just plain silly to warn about, like assigning the NULL
value to a pointer (why would that be wrong??) or comparing an unsigned
char to a small constant integer.  I also find it extremely lacking that
it does not parse the system includefiles to pickup types.
The author of this tool is of the typical &quot;I wished that C would be
Pascal&quot; type, who did not carefully study the basics of the C language. 
What you are doing by eradicating warnings is just massaging the source to
his likings, not improving the quality in a general sense.

To come back to the above macros: they are not sacred.  I see some room
for improvement.  But they were carefully designed, and they do work.  In
the original version.
When splint is issuing warnings about them, you could make modifications. 
But I object to modifications that destroy the functionality (and thus
introduce bugs) just because they make splint happy.

Before you try your next modification, I would suggest that you write a
test program, that does getx calls on a buffer that you fill with some
testdata.  Use testvalues that provide you with some info, e.g.:

0102030405060708
FFFEFDFCFBFAF9F8

See if your &quot;improved&quot; macro still returns the same value when accessing
this data.  Yours don't, and it shows as problems that you don't notice
every time (because values are more often positive than negative).

In hindsight, it would have been better to have separate macros for signed
and unsigned results.  This makes the list longer:

getsb
getub
getsw
getuw
getsl
getul

but it would allow the removal of some of the casts in the code.  The
unsigned variants would also be more suitable to build the getl in terms
of getw etc.

The macros would have to be carefully coded again, and the entire binary
drivers again need to be checked against the manufacturers docs to make
sure that the macro used agrees with the type of value in the message
(signed or unsigned).
The datatypes used to store the result, and the parameters specified for
functions, should match as closely as possible with these types.
(e.g. when &quot;gps week&quot; is an unsigned, it should not be passed to
gpstime_to_unix as an int)

But I am not going to do that in an environment as it exists now.
