<PRE>I've been attempting to upgrade gpsfake to handle multiple sessions so I
can try to reproduce Wojciech Kazubski's apparent resource-exhaustion bug
in a controlled environment. While doing this, I have wandered into a swamp.

It appears that the hotplug scripts don't work, because something is
broken in the daemon code that handles control-socket commands.  The
symptom is that when an add-device command is sent down the control
socked, gpsd notes that a control-socked connection has been
established, but then the actual socket read fails.

Here's the weird part.  I *saw this work* at rev level 2638, after
fixing a different bug.  But reverting to that rev level, it doesn't
work now.  The test:  Start

    gpsd -D 4 -N -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

then do &quot;gpsd.hotplug add /dev/ttyUSB0&quot; on another terminal.  You 
will see a message something like this:

    gpsd: control socket connect on 5

that indicates gpsd has accepted the control-socket connection. If it
works, you should see another few messages -- the whole something like this:

    gpsd: control socket connect on 5
    gpsd: &lt;= control(5): +/dev/ttyUSB0
    gpsd: &lt;= control(5): adding /dev/ttyUSB0
    gpsd: opening GPS data source at '/dev/ttyUSB0'

Apparently something in the way the control-socket code is implemented
has a phase-of-the-moon dependency.  It's nothing obvious; the code
for reading from control sockets, almost exactly identical, works fine.

Can *anybody* get this test to work?

Would somebody who isn't me and knows the sockets API better than I
do please take a hard look at gpsd.c:1144-1173 and tell me what, if
anything, I'm screwing up?

The same applies for other kinds of long-lasting low-level pain. [...]
The body's response to being jabbed, pierced, and cut is to produce
endorphins. [...]  So here's my programme for breaking that cycle of
dependency on Windows: get left arm tattooed with dragon motif, buy a
crate of Jamaican Hot! Pepper Sauce, get nipples pierced.  With any
luck that will produce enough endorphins to make Windows completely
redundant, and I can then upgrade to Linux and get on with things.
