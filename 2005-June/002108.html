<PRE>Rob Janssen writes:
&gt;<i>The gpsd does not seem to have a knowledge about update cycles.  Each

</I>&gt;<i>specific message updates.  The handle_packet routine smacks that in
</I>&gt;<i>session-&gt;gpsdata.set and proceeds as if only those values are valid.
</I>
You are correct.

&gt;<i>However, the typical GPS receiver does not output all its information in a
</I>&gt;<i>single message.  Information is sent in &quot;message cycles&quot; which consist of
</I>&gt;<i>several different message types that convey different parts of the fix
</I>&gt;<i>data.
</I>&gt;<i>They often show signs of haphazard design, as you pointed out in a writeup
</I>&gt;<i>on the website.
</I>&gt;<i>However, they are a fact of life, and we need to handle this in gpsd.
</I>
Again you are correct, and I agree.

&gt;<i>For example, in TSIP the position, velocity, time and DOP data are all
</I>&gt;<i>sent in different messages in a cycle.  handle_packet (before my patch)
</I>&gt;<i>assumes that DOP values are only sent in message that also contain LATLON,
</I>&gt;<i>but this is simply not the case.
</I>
I think you might have slightly misinterpreted the code.  There are
separate LATLON_SET and DOP_SET flags precisely so those messages
*won't* be tied together in the handler logic.  That separation is
what made the change you suggested yesterday something that was possible
to do quickly and easily.

&gt;<i>As the O= output is sent for every message parsed (as I wrote yesterday),
</I>&gt;<i>things are even worse: for every message parsed an O packet is assembled
</I>&gt;<i>with different mask flags as a starting point, so O packets are sent with
</I>&gt;<i>alternating valid and unknown data in the same position.
</I>
Once again you are correct.  That is an unavoidable consequence of the
assumption now built in, which is that there will be one immediate
report per sentence or packet.

&gt;<i>I think what should happen is that the mask flags accumulate during a
</I>&gt;<i>message cycle and are only reset between cycles.  And of course the O
</I>&gt;<i>packet should be sent only after all data for that cycle has been
</I>&gt;<i>collected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What this requires is some detection of the update cycle.  I understand
</I>&gt;<i>that you want to keep the latency low (although I do not really see why
</I>&gt;<i>this matters so much, given the characteristics of a typical receiver), so
</I>&gt;<i>this may not be really simple. 
</I>
I gave considerable thought to this issue about six weeks ago.  Some
listmembers may recall that I proposed accumulating data across a
message cycle in order to deliver one unified report, just as Rob is
now urging.  This suggestion was shot down from several directions by
people who objected to adding latency to any of the reports.
Personally, Rob, I agree with you about the extra latency not being a
big deal.  But...

There turns out to be a more fundamental problem with accumulating
data -- as you correctly point out, the real issue is detecting the
start and end of a send cycle so we'll know when to flush buffers and
clear flags.  

You recognize this problem, but I don't think you have yet realized
just how nasty it is.  While the opposition to increasing latency
discouraged me, I didn't really give up on the idea of buffering data
until I ran head-on into this second issue.

&gt;<i>                             The start of a cycle is probably easier to
</I>&gt;<i>find than the end, but sending all data about the previous cycle at that
</I>&gt;<i>moment will introduce a 1 second latency.
</I>&gt;<i>However, I think something needs to be done, as what happens now is not
</I>&gt;<i>very reasonable.
</I>
Unfortunately, even finding start-of-cycle turns out to be hard to do
reliably.  My next post will be a detailed discussion of the problem
in a form suitable for including in the Hacker's Guide.
