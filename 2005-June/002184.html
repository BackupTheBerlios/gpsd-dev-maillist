I am currently testing.  I have undone my hardware changes and it did not
make any difference.  Now I have undone my patch to ppsmonitor and it
works again.

For this receiver I have no PPS wired and the DCD seems to pickup noise.
When the new patch is active it closes the ppsmonitor thread,
Fine, I would say.  But from then on the program keeps spinning in a loop
like this:

gpsd -n -N -D 7 /dev/ttyS1
gpsd: launching (Version 2.26)
gpsd: listening on port gpsd
gpsd: changing to group 14
gpsd: running with effective group ID 14
gpsd: running with effective user ID 65534
gpsd: opening GPS data source at '/dev/ttyS1'
gpsd: garmin_gps not active.
gpsd: no probe matched...
gpsd: speed 9600, 8N1
gpsd: gpsd_activate: opened GPS (4)
gpsd: carrier-detect on /dev/ttyS1 changed to 0
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x10, new state: 26
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x8f, new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character ' ', new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x00, new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x00, new state: 27
gpsd: TIOCMIWAIT returns unchanged state, ppsmonitor terminates
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x00, new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x00, new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x00, new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x00, new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x00, new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 1 chars waiting
gpsd: Character 0x09, new state: 27
gpsd: GPS has 0 chars waiting
gpsd: GPS has 0 chars waiting
gpsd: GPS has 0 chars waiting
gpsd: closing GPS=/dev/ttyS1
gpsd: Received terminating signal 2. Exiting...
(here I hit ctrl-c)

I have no idea why the receiver falls dead then the ppsmonitor terminates.
Could phtreads be closing the device??  I would not think so...
If this is true the latest patch has to go out.
