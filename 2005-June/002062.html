<PRE>According to Andreas, sirf.c is working fine with Rob's new macros.
I have successfully changed sirfmon.c to use them. I have also moved
into bits.h the putbyte/putword/putlong macros, and sirfmon uses
those as well.  I now consider bits.h to be finished, as far as I'm
concerned, and will leave it to Rob's tender mercies to maintain.

Here are the current to-do items:

1. Improve the regression-test-suite coverage

I just got three SiRF logs from Andreas that will help a lot, and a
monster from Chris Kuethe that may not go into the regular regression
test simply because it's too large.  (I want the regression test to
run quickly so developers will do it often.)

Still needed: sample packet dumps for Zodiac, TSIP, and uBlox chips.

2. Hack the TSIP driver to use the new macros and test it

This is Rob Janssen's job.

3. Internal type cleanup

A lot of this is already done.  Three major steps were:

(a) Introducing bool and using it where appropriate.

(b) Introducing a typedef for gps_data_t status masks.  (This might
    save our butts someday if we have to push the number of flagged
    fields past 31.)

(c) Moving the separation member.

I'll work more on the type cleanup today.  

4. Start the stable branch

Nobody has volunteered to be the stable-branch manager yet.  But
I feel we're rapidly approaching a stable release point.  The type
cleanup will be done soon, and the only other remaining issue is
the state of the TSIP driver.

5. Integrate the True North support

I still do not expect this to be difficult.  I may do it tonight.  I
do not consider it a requirement for the stable release, however.

6. Enable gpsd to set the system timezone

This won't happen soon and may not happen at all.  As others have
pointed out, it's messy and problematic.

Gun Control: The theory that a woman found dead in an alley, raped and
strangled with her panty hose, is somehow morally superior to a
woman explaining to police how her attacker got that fatal bullet wound.
