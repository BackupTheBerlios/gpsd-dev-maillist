<PRE>&gt;<i> But, Rob: Wojciech's problem is slightly different from yours and
</I>&gt;<i> harder to solve.  Because TSIP identifies itself, the code could in
</I>&gt;<i> theory know what the last packet in an update cycle is and suppress
</I>&gt;<i> all reports prior to that, if you were willing to accept less than a
</I>&gt;<i> second of latency in favor of getting an accumulated report.
</I>
Well, TSIP has some problems as well...
Many packets are sent when the corresponding poll command is issued, or
when the receiver feels like it.  That can be because the data changes,
because the fix status changes (fix or no fix), etc.
So what you receive depends on many variables.  And I have no idea at what
priority the poll commands are processed, so it may well be that the
responses get interwoven between packets the receiver sents in a regular
cycle.
My driver checks if certain packets have not been received for some time
and issues a poll.   But I have seen (especially before tuning the
timeouts) that the receiver sent a packet by itself and then it responded
to the poll, sending the same packet more than once (back to back).

We now have double-buffering, which is good for most data in TSIP, except
for DOP and its derived values.  Those are not sent every cycle (unless I
change the poll rate to force that), so what we now have is (part of) one
cycle with valid data and n/a data the remainder of the time.


&gt;<i> xgps is a test client.  It's intended to show developers what the
</I>&gt;<i> daemon is doing, so it doesn't buffer old information but rather
</I>&gt;<i> presents the contents of each O response as it comes up.
</I>
Well, I think many applications would prefer not to bother with buffering.
 It would be best when gpsd somehow does this, and xgps shows stable data
without its own buffering.

While googling around for many-channel receivers this week I found a &quot;Sony
binary protocol&quot; that sends everything it knows in one single packet!
Before you get too excited: it uses 7 bits of each byte to send 14-bit and
28-bit values.  Apparently they wanted to support 7-bit serial interfaces.
Sensible design often seems a zero-sum game.
