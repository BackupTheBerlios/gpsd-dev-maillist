<PRE>I've been spending my working time the last couple of days heavily
hacking gpsfake with the intention of supporting serious Valgrind
auditing of the code.  Here are the first results:

1. gpsfake is now a trivial wrapper around a TestSession class that
can be used to completely control a daemon test.  The class has
methods to create and terminate clients, also to attach and detach
fake GPS devices.  Each fake GPS is in actuality a subthread cycling
sentences from a specified logfile into the master end of a pty, with
a gpsd instance watching the slave end.

2. The distribution now includes a Python script called
valgrind-audit, which uses the TestSession class to run gpsd
under Valgrind in a completely controlled environment.

3. valgrind-audit has uncovered a memory leak exactly where one might
have been expected, in device deallocation.  This is now fixed.

The splint audit was stage one; this is stage two.  I expect to make
valgrind-audit a thorough torture test of the dynamic-allocation
behavior of the daemon.  This will give us objective reason for
confidence that the code does not contain memory leaks, double frees,
overruns of the stack or dynamic storage areas, etc.

My current plan is to do a point release when the Valgrind audit
looks complete, probably late this coming week.  There are currently
no new features or logic changes in the damon itself other than
minor bug fixes.

Other developers are encouraged to add their own tests to
valgrind-audit.  All the TestSession class methods are documented,
and the usage pattern should be apparent from the existing tests.

As a side effect, I have sent a patch to the Valgrind maintainers to
fix an annoying confirmation prompt :-).
