<PRE>I just read Rob Janssen's upset screed about my latest commit.  I then
lost it due to a glitch related to my somewhat jerry-rigged
arrangement for reading mail on the road.

In one respect, Rob simply has his facts wrong.  That change to sirf.c
is not a random twitch in an unexplored direction.  Allowing for the
rename of the macros, it simply reverts them to an earlier state that
is known good -- I used Andreas Brauchli's information that revision
2560 is the last one without a speed bug.  Thus, this code has already
been thoroughly &quot;investigated&quot; in Rob's sense.

As for his more general objections to the way I am using splint, I
think they are ill-founded.  To begin with, he discounts the benefits
of the approach.  So far, I have identified four actual bugs of the 
kind that unaided hand-checking would have been rather unlikely to find.

Beyond this, I believe the quality of the code has improved significantly.  

1. In one crucial place in the channel-allocation logic there was a
piece of code that defeated splint's ability to do static checking on
the status of allocated memory, but could be simplified to a version
that did not have that property.  The resulting code is simpler and
better.

2. In several other places, I had written conditionals that relied on
the exceptional value being zero.  splint caught these and embarrassed
me into turning them into comparisons with a manifest constant.

3. splint pointed out numerous other minor readability problems which
I have fixed.  Each one is one less potential maintainance problem for
a future maintainer.

4. Even the minor brouhaha with the macro casts has had good
consequences.  The driver code is now *far* more explicit about the
word size and signedness assumptions it makes.

Rob takes me to task for inserting a boatload of casts rather than
thinking carefully about what the concrete types of arguments should
be.  In this he is partly just mistaken -- one thing I have done is
systematically introduced the bool type where it makes semantic sense.
So in one major respect the type cleanup he advocates has already 
taken place.

What he also doesn't understand is that I consider zero splint
warnings to be a transitional stage.  The reason to go for zero
warnings is so that when anybody changes the code afterwards, running
splint will provide clear feedback about the consequences of the
change.

In particular, once we *get* to zero warnings, it will be possible for
me to go in and make serious changes to the type signatures of various
structures and functions, then run splint and be *very sure* of what
the consequences are.

That is what I plan as the second stage of the splint cleanup.  So
everything I understand Rob to be advocating will be done and is
already part of my plans.

Finally, I want to note -- and acknowledge -- that part of what we are
having here is a clash of styles.  Rob is, by instinct, a more careful 
programmer than I am.  His habit is to do things carefully and in
small increments.  Mine is not.

I am willing to make large changes and live with the possibility that
something will break, provided that three conditions obtain.  One: the
project must be under version control, so that if I end up screwing
the pooch it is easy to revert to a good version.  Two: It must be
possible to do mechanical regression tests over most of the code,
something I arranged with gpsfake.  Three: there must be people like
Rob Janssen around to spot my mistakes, something he does very well.

My loose style of doing things, pursued alone and without a
version-control system, would be disastrous.  But with the right
collaborators and background conditions, it produces much faster
development (and *without* sacrificing quality) than a more
conservative approach ever will.

Consider the very rapid rate at which gpsd has acquired new capabilities
over the last six months as evidence of this.  Also, reflect that the 
bugs we have experienced have been few and relatively minor --
because, in truth, I am more careful than I sometimes appear.

Hoplophobia (n.): The irrational fear of weapons, correctly described by 
Freud as &quot;a sign of emotional and sexual immaturity&quot;.  Hoplophobia, like
homophobia, is a displacement symptom; hoplophobes fear their own
&quot;forbidden&quot; feelings and urges to commit violence.  This would be
harmless, except that they project these feelings onto others.  The
sequelae of this neurosis include irrational and dangerous behaviors
such as passing &quot;gun-control&quot; laws and trashing the Constitution.
