Eric, thanks for he note.  I didn't realize that there was such a
thriving development effort on gpsd.

I certainly have no objections to merging the functionality of dgpsip
into gpsd.  I'm not sure it is worth the effort though.  My dgpsip had
a purpose back in 2000 when we had the better part of 50 meters
peak-to-peak &quot;selective availability&quot;-induced swings.  Now that that
nonsense is off, consumer-grade GPS's hardly change their readings
much when one connects them to a differential correction data stream.

Another complication is that we still don't have low-cost internet
connections available to the average outdoor or automotive laptop
user.  Without that there is no simple way to get differential
corrections to the users that could use them the most.

Just to give a bit of background, and hopefully this isn't common
knowledge to all the developers on the list.  There is an important
bit of difference between survey grade GPS's and consumer GPS's.
Consumer GPS's just look at the phase of the encoded data stream
coming from the satellites when trying to determine how far they are
from each satellite.  Survey GPS's start with that same rough data
stream and then look at the phase of the RF carrier to get a really
fine-grained picture.  It is not uncommon to see survey grade GPS's
advertised with sub-centimeter accuracies when used in a pairs with
differential correction data passed between them.  To do those types
of differential corrections much more data has to be passed from the
reference GPS to the mobile GPS.  The reference GPS also has to be
fairly close to the mobile GPS.  Using corrections from many 100's of
miles away isn't going to help much.  That tends to limit the
usefulness of internet-based differential corrections where there are
only a few reference GPS's sprinkled around the net.

In any case, I'll certainly try to help out.  One thing I can do right
away is test gnomad (my long in development GPS mapping program)
<A HREF="http://www.gnomad-mapping.com/">http://www.gnomad-mapping.com/</A> against the current gpsd.  I recall it
could use it just fine back when I last tried it.

If you folks do have the ear of one of the big GPS chip companies it
may be possible to get them to do things in a more computer-friendly
way.  I would love to see GPS's send clearly delimited, full updates
with everything in one message.

(BTW. I just noticed gmane.org has this mailing list on their nntp
redirector.  No need to sign me up at your end.)
