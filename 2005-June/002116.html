<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>For example, in TSIP the position, velocity, time and DOP data are all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>sent in different messages in a cycle.  handle_packet (before my patch)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>assumes that DOP values are only sent in message that also contain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LATLON,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>but this is simply not the case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you might have slightly misinterpreted the code.  There are
</I>&gt;<i> separate LATLON_SET and DOP_SET flags precisely so those messages
</I>&gt;<i> *won't* be tied together in the handler logic.  That separation is
</I>&gt;<i> what made the change you suggested yesterday something that was possible
</I>&gt;<i> to do quickly and easily.
</I>
... but I am not so sure why that check was there in the first place.
The DOP_SET flags were only looked at inside an if statement that checked
for LATLON_SET so they were only handled when both latitude/longitude and
DOP appeared in the same message, which they don't for a Trimble receiver.
Maybe there is some other receiver where the DOP values are invalid when
there is no latitude/longitude and that is why that check was made?
The check is still around the SPEEDERR and CLIMBERR checks, do you want to
say that it can be removed there as well?
(I did not want to do that as it seems to save state, including lat/lon,
from the previous fix)

&gt;&gt;<i>As the O= output is sent for every message parsed (as I wrote yesterday),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>things are even worse: for every message parsed an O packet is assembled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>with different mask flags as a starting point, so O packets are sent with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>alternating valid and unknown data in the same position.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once again you are correct.  That is an unavoidable consequence of the
</I>&gt;<i> assumption now built in, which is that there will be one immediate
</I>&gt;<i> report per sentence or packet.
</I>
One of the problems is that part of the O line builder uses _NOT_VALID
values (which *are* saved across GPS message boundaries), and part uses
_SET  indicators (which only refer to the last received message),
The latter causes the toggling of valid/invalid data.
But of course the former means that sometimes data is present in the
message that is obtained from a previous message cycle, and thus from a
previous fix.

&gt;<i> There turns out to be a more fundamental problem with accumulating
</I>&gt;<i> data -- as you correctly point out, the real issue is detecting the
</I>&gt;<i> start and end of a send cycle so we'll know when to flush buffers and
</I>&gt;<i> clear flags.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You recognize this problem, but I don't think you have yet realized
</I>&gt;<i> just how nasty it is.  While the opposition to increasing latency
</I>&gt;<i> discouraged me, I didn't really give up on the idea of buffering data
</I>&gt;<i> until I ran head-on into this second issue.
</I>
It depends on the actual receiver at hand.  But a quite large subset of
the receivers works (at least as I read it from protocol documents) like
this:

1. the receiver calculates a fix from the received satellite signals.

2. it stores this fix in internal memory, including a timestamp that
defines when this fix was obtained.

3. it looks at communication configuration bits and sends out a series of
messages that contain several subsets of this fix data, and usually also
the timestamp.

4. it waits for another cycletime tick (usually a second) and goes back to 1.

The timestamp in the messages is not the current time, but the time the
fix was calculated.  This also explains why time in messages is often off
so much more than one would expect from only communication delays.

So it is actually quite simple to find the start of the cycle: this occurs
when the timestamp in the messages differs from the last-seen one.  Some
protocols even have a cycling &quot;fix sequence number&quot; that can be used to
correlate the messages within a single fix.

Of course, what is not so easy is to know which message is the last in a
series.  One could peek down in the communication buffer and assume that a
message is last when no data immediately arrives after it, but as you
point out that could be unreliable when cycles run together.

Maybe the two techniques could be combined: when the timestamp changes we
always assume a new cycle has started (this may misfire on some receivers
but it will never make matters worse than they are now).  When no input is
pending after processing a message, we ship the fix data to the client. 
When we detect that a new cycle starts and we had not yet sent the data
from the previous cycle, we send it immediately.

That should work.  However, when you want to guarantee that all data in an
O message is as-much-as-possible from a single fix calculated by the
receiver, you will need to double-buffer the fix data.
The message parser now immediately overwrites fix data, so when it returns
and the caller detects (by checking the timestamp) the message had started
a new cycle, it is too late to ship the accumulated data from the previous
cycle intact.
