<PRE>A new entry in the Hacking Guide:

** Report-per-packet vs. accumulation across an entire cycle

Considered in the abstract, the cleanest thing for a
position/velocity/time oracle to return is a 14-tuple including
position components in all four dimensions, velocity in three, and
associated error estimates for all seven degrees of freedom.  This is
what the O message in GPSD protocol attempts to deliver.

Unfortunately GPS protocols are, in general, rather badly designed for
approximating this.  For historical reasons, NMEA splits 2-D position
info and altitude in two different messages, each issued once
during the normal 1-second send cycle.  Some vendor binary
protocols have similar problems.

This means that gpsd may execute one of two policies.  Either it
must issue a separate report on each sentence or packet containing PVT
information, or it must accumulate data across an entire send cycle
and issue a unified report at end of cycle.  Report-per-packet is
simpler, and adds minimum reporting latency, but means that O
responses may issue more than once per second with complementary
sets of data that add up to a complete report.  The accumulating
policy means there will be exactly one report per cycle and it will
contain full PVT information, but it may have additional latency
of up to one second.

Presently gpsd implements only report-per-packet.  This works well
with the SiRF protocol (all PVT data is in packet type 02) and with
the Zodiac protocol (all PVT data is in the type 1000 packet).  These,
together, account for a share of the GPS market that is 80% and rising
in 2005.  It works less well with generic NMEA devices.

The reason we have not attempted an accumulating policy is that it
would require gpsd to know which sentences start and end the GPS send
cycle is, so as to know when to ship the accumulated data to the
client and clear the buffers.  Which sentence this is does, in fact,
vary across GPS types. One of gpsd's design goals, zero configuration,
means that we can't count on the user or administrator passing gpsd
this information; instead, gpsd must somehow be able to autodetect it.

This turns out to be hard. We can get timestamps from some (though not
all) NMEA sentences, but there are some GPSes that change the timestamp
during the send cycle as well as at start and end.  Thus, we can't
use coincidence of timestamps to map the cycle.

We can't even count on all send cycles of the same device looking the
same.  Many GPSes only send GSV when they have satellite lock.
Without knowing the GPS type in advance, it isn't predictable where in
the send cycle the GSV will be emitted.

Thus, the only information we have to go on is the wall-clock timing
of the sentences in the send cycle.  The feature we need to look for
is the inter-cycle pause.  And the first problem is that at some
speeds, with some devices, there isn't one.  In particular, at 4800bps
on an NMEA device sending GGA/RMC/VTG/GLL/GSA/GSV, the intercycle
pause is nonexistent or too small to be detectible.  See the first
graph in the paper on GPS latency profiling at
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.berlios.de/performance.html">http://www.berlios.de/performance.html</A>&gt;. In that one, transmission
times sometimes add to slightly more than a full 1-second cycle,
probably due to instrumentation error; the point is, there is no
significant gap to be detected before the next cycle.

Even if we could rely on that gap to be present, the logic needed to
detect it is of the sort that is notoriously prone to subtle timing
failures.  For example, a system-load-induced stall in the host
operating system's serial layer, happening at the right time shortly
after device open, might masquerade as an intercycle gap, causing gpsd
to lock onto the wrong sentence.

With great effort and ingenuity some of these problems could be at
least partly solved.  Unfortunately, there is every reason to suspect
the resulting code would be complex, brittle and bug-prone.
Presently, it doesn't seem like a good idea for a marginal improvemnt
in 20% of GPSes.
