<PRE>I think I found the reason you're not seeing time-date.  If I'm
correct, it's a side effect of a change I made in in 2.25 to make
gpsd independent of the system clock, so it can be used to *set* the
system clock.

You'll get a zero time/date from a GGA or GLL that has never been
preceded by an RMC or ZDA.  The reason: gpsd doesn't yet know what
year it is.  Before 2.25 I grabbed this information from the 
system clock, but this gives unhappy results if the system clock
is inaccurate -- especially if it has been recently zeroed, in which
case you'll get not just the wrong year but the wrong *century*!

Rather than pretending to know something from the GPS that it doesn't,
I have elected to make gpsd confess that it doesn't have a valid
timestamp in this situation.  It should only last at most one cycle,
until the daemon picks up a valid GPRMC sentence.

I'll shortly check in a change that ensures the time-date field is ?
rather than 0 in this situation.
