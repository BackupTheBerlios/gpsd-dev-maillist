<PRE>I think we are nearing resolution on the SiRF bugs introduced by my
attempt to splint-clean the code.  Here are the near-future things
I believe we should be considering beyond that:

1. Finish the splint cleaning

I know Rob Janssen, and perhaps some of the rest of you, think splint is
overly fussy and not uncovering enough real problems to justify the 
bugs introduced during the process.  I have already explained in
detail the positive results and the reasons why I think this is 
a mistaken judgment, so I won't belabor them here.  

Phase one of the splint cleanup, now almost complete, will be getting
warnings to zero.  Phase two will be the internal types cleanup that
Rob Janssen has been advocating, using splint to spot the places where
tweaking signatures produces potential bugs.

2. Start the stable branch

Yes, we probably should have a stable branch.  For this, an active
senior developer who is *not me* should volunteer to be the stable
branch manager.  Eligible senior developers, in my view, would
certainly include Remco Treffkorn, Gary Miller, and Rob Janssen;
I'd be open to persusion about some others.

3. Integrate the True North support

I do not expect this to be difficult.  The driver architecture really
does work pretty well at containing the required changes.

4. Enable gpsd to set the system timezone

David Wheeler (the &quot;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&quot; person)
suggested this at FISL.  If we're going to give gpsd the capability
to set system time via ntpd, why not let it set timezone as well?
A good thing for hackers travelling with laptops!

The major issue here is that I have not yet found code, or a
database, that would allow mapping from lon/lat to timezone.
