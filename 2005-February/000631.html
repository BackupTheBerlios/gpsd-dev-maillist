Yes.

At least.  I've references to UARTs in PCs with 64 byte chip level
FIFO's.  The silicon guys can probably tweak it up without having to
worry the software guys.

&gt;<i> I think it's pretty safe to assume no parity; I haven't seen or heard

I've seen some professional gear doing NMEA that relies on parity; but
certainly it isn't popular with consumer level stuff.  Parity is
excellent for ignoring noise on the line.  Kinda like defense in depth.

&gt;<i> Actually, at this point, the problem isn't the blat of garbage we get

Ah, right.  Are you calling tcdrain() first, so that you know that the
kernel has dropped everything into the UART?  I don't know if these
UARTs have transmit buffers longer than a character, but I wouldn't be
surprised if they did these days.  After tcdrain() you'd have to wait as
many bit times as there are bytes in the chip buffer, otherwise the baud
rate change might affect data as it is leaving.

A digital storage oscilloscope would be great ... you could make sure
that the message is appearing at a constant rate.
