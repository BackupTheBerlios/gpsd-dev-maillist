I go for 50ms. It's a nice round number and it seems to work for all the
various hardware I have:

Pharos iGPS360 + GSW 2.3.1ES + prolific 
Rayming TN-200 + GSW 2.3.1 + ftdi
Rayming TN-200 + GSW 2.3.2 + ftdi

&gt;<i> I'd bet you and Chris Kuethe a good steak dinner that number either

</I>
Cool. This is the second time today I've had the opportunity of STFU and
RTFM. This time, I took it. :)

As far ask I can tell, the input messages return an &quot;Ack InputXXX.&quot; string,
so if you're quick enough about it, you should be able to see &quot;Ack Input100.&quot;
coming back at you before the baud change.

I bet there's a delay time related to the speed. I run my receivers at 57600
when possible, and 50ms works for me. The SiRFstarII has an embedded ARM7TDMI
core...

<A HREF="http://www.samsung.com/Products/Semiconductor/SystemLSI/Networks/PersonalNTASSP/CommunicationProcessor/S3C4510B/um_s3c4510b_rev1.pdf">http://www.samsung.com/Products/Semiconductor/SystemLSI/Networks/PersonalNTASSP/CommunicationProcessor/S3C4510B/um_s3c4510b_rev1.pdf</A>
It's not exactly the same ARM7 that SiRF uses, but it talks a lot about the
peripherals. Look for &quot;HDLC BRG Time Constant Register&quot;

&quot;The HDLC BRG time constant register value can be changed at any time, but
the new value does not take effect until the next time the constant is loaded
into the down counter. No attempt is made to synchronize the loading of the
time constant into HBRGTC while the clock is driving the down counter. For
this reason, you should first disable the baud rate generator before loading
the new time constant into the HBRGTC register.&quot;

&gt;<i> I feel better now.  This has been bugging me for three days.  Have I
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned that I hate serial-device programming?
</I>
This is why I did it in perl and why I offloaded it to a module that
WorksForMe(tm). I just couldn't stomach the thought of doing all this
bitbanging myself.

&gt;<i> Backstory, for those as haven't seen it: I wanted to be able to change
</I>&gt;<i> the baud rate of the link so I could profile for latency at different
</I>&gt;<i> baud rates and see if line speed really matters.
</I>
Off the cuff I'd say it does matter: some messages are variable length
(Like GPGSA and GPGSV) and the faster we can transmit those bloated piggy
messages, the better.

&gt;<i> Now to see if I can figure out how to probe for a SiRF device
</I>&gt;<i> with $PSRF105,1*3E\r\n and looking for an $Ack response.  I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> make this work before, but the obvious next thing to try is to put
</I>&gt;<i> a sleep(1) after the send...
</I>
Or a $Nak if you want to avoid changing anything. :)

&gt;<i> Hey Chris, want me to put you on the dev list?
</I>
Already done.

      GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
