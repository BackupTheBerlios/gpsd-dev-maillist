<PRE>It's almost time for another release, I think.  If you have outstanding
patches or bug reports, ship 'em here please.

I have integrated the alpha code for Garmin binary protocol, and
refactored it so most of the NMEA generation that was duplicated with
zodiac.c now lives in libgpsd_core.c.  The refactoring means that the
Zodiac support, as well as the Garmin, needs another round of testing.

There are new features to support profiling the daemon:

* A 'B' command returns the RS232 parameters, and a new 'C'
  command returns the update cycle time.

* The daemon now always passes up a timestamp for every sentence that 
  has one, even if the PVT fields aren't valid.

* If PROFILING is enabled, a B= form of the B command allows you to
  change the baud rate on the link to the GPS (currently works for SiRF 
  chips only).

gpsprof uses these to compute its timing figures and do its plots.

I fixed a core-dump bug in processing of the GLL variant that does not
include an FAA Mode Indicator. 

When using the NMEA driver, gpsd now hunts for a baud rate rather than
requiring a fixed one to be set.

I've added gpsfake, a test harness for gpsd that feeds it NMEA
sentences through a pty.

I still have not gotten the SiRF probe with $PSR105 to work, dangit.
Adding a delay does not solve this one, I still don't see an $Ack or
any other response.
