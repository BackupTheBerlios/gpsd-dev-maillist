&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, someone mentioned a patch to xgps to reopen the gpsd connection if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gpsd is restarted?  That would be nice for this sort of development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked into it.  It's a bad idea -- doesn't work with the
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, you end up having to do unnatural things to the API
</I>&gt;<i> because your file descriptors vanish out from under you.
</I>
After having used this with roadgps, I can confirm that it is a good
idea.  It make it possible to leave xgps running for a long time, even
if I have to restart or replace gpsd on the fly.

If the architecture of the clients are unable to handle this, I
seriously believe the clients architecture need an upgrade.

I'm aware of the problems with the current design, as I tried to
rewrite it to get it to reconnect.  It is doable, but require quite a
lot of rewriting.
