I grok. I was really happy when sirf_sync_serial finally worked, because
that meant that I could have each tool set up the serial port the way it
wanted, without me having to run SiRFdemo every time.

&gt;<i> Yeah, and if I grok what James explained in his long posting, those few bytes

Hnf. There's gotta be a way to force the flush. &quot;I don't care that there
might be data in there, damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead!&quot; Maybe a
bunch of small fast dummy reads until you get no more data. Then the buffer
is empty and you can move on to bigger normal reads.

That's just about what James suggested, but he said it better.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm guessing it's a UART thing. At least with my PERL code, the same delay

Yep, that's why we have UARTs... so we don't have to do this bit-banging
ourselves. :)

      GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
