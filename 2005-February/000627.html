OK, that's the answer I pretty much expected.
 
&gt;<i> When the baud rate is changed, a new divisor for the oscillator is sent
</I>&gt;<i> to the UART (as an I/O memory port write, see drivers/serial/8250.c:1701
</I>&gt;<i> of 2.6.10).  This changes all the derived clocks.  The changes are not

</I>&gt;<i> from the chip buffer is considered unpredictable.  The UART may also
</I>&gt;<i> report framing errors.  There's a settling time during which the clocks
</I>&gt;<i> are invalid, which varies according to the chip model.  Some chips clear
</I>&gt;<i> their buffers, some do not.  The kernel may also have characters
</I>&gt;<i> buffered; but these will have been sampled at the prior baud rate.
</I>
If I'm getting this right, the kernel's buffers can be cleared with tcflush(),
but whether the UART's physical FIFO gets cleared is not under software
control and depends on the UART hardware design.  My dim memory from 
fifteen years ago when I was closer to this stuff is that the physical
FIFO is on a 16550 is 8 to 14 bytes long, thus we're going to see it 
dribble about that many butes after a baud change.

&gt;<i> Do you only test baud rate?  Other factors are number of bits in the
</I>&gt;<i> word, parity existence and polarity, and number of stop bits.  There can
</I>&gt;<i> be multiple working combinations.  There can be combinations that work
</I>&gt;<i> for most bytes read and then fail on one.  Verify the NMEA checksum.
</I>
At the moment I only check baud rates.  I suppose I could iterate over
one or two stop bits -- the FV18 is 7N2.  I think it's pretty safe to
assume no parity; I haven't seen or heard of a serial link using even
parity in almost twenty years, and I've *never* seen odd parity.

The checksum stuff should be more logic to go in nmea_validate_buffer().

&gt;<i> Do you shut off the receiver before changing the baud rate?  Toggle
</I>&gt;<i> CREAD, read all data received in a second, flush, then change the baud
</I>&gt;<i> rate, then toggle CREAD back again.  This will reduce the chances of
</I>&gt;<i> unpredictable data; the flood gates will open in the middle of a bit
</I>&gt;<i> stream and the UART should resynchronise more predictably.
</I>
Actually, at this point, the problem isn't the blat of garbage we get
after a baud rate change; that's easy to ignore.  It is -- or rather
was -- that the GPS was not seeing the transmitted baud-rate-change
$PSRF string at all.

But I just solved that one!  Turns out what's needed is some settle time 
after the $PSRF is shipped but before you change the link speed.  One
second does it; I'm going to do the obvious binary search and see if I
can shave something off that.
