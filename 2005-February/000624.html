It should have nothing to do with host-processor speed, provided you're
talking about something faster than a 33MHz 486.

It is more to do with the serial port hardware implementation and the
operating system drivers.  Most motherboard ports these days on the PC
architecture are 16550 UARTs, but some are different.  They also
implement the 16550-style differently.  They have an internal buffer,
which can only be cleared (if I recall correctly) by reading it.

The baud rate is used to divide an oscillator into time periods; the
derived baud rate clock.  This is a wave that determines when the bits
are sampled.  It's usually ten (or more) cycles per bit time.  Another
two divisions of this clock are used to align the unpacking to the bit
edges that are experienced on the input.  Yet another division of the
clock is used to count the number of bits in the byte.

When the baud rate is changed, a new divisor for the oscillator is sent
to the UART (as an I/O memory port write, see drivers/serial/8250.c:1701
of 2.6.10).  This changes all the derived clocks.  The changes are not
synchronised.  If data is arriving at the time, the resulting data read
from the chip buffer is considered unpredictable.  The UART may also
report framing errors.  There's a settling time during which the clocks
are invalid, which varies according to the chip model.  Some chips clear
their buffers, some do not.  The kernel may also have characters
buffered; but these will have been sampled at the prior baud rate.

A framing error is when the UART expected to see a stop bit but instead
saw activity.  Framing errors do not normally occur with correctly
operating devices set on the right baud rate.  Framing errors will occur
frequently if the baud rate of the receiver (the UART) is set higher
than the baud rate of the transmitter (the GPS).  The converse is not
always true; it depends on the length of the data being transmitted.
You may be able to add a heuristic to detect framing errors.

Automatic baud rate detection (ABR, or autobaud) is where a receiving
device figures it all out from someone hitting Return or Enter; the
combination of the misread data and the framing error flag can be enough
to determine the baud rate predictably.  VMS did this.  ;-)  This
technique isn't an option for NMEA; the range of characters you might
get is quite large.

It is possible for a UART to become synchronised to the incoming bit
stream a few bits out of kilter.  This is especially possible with NMEA
if the data being sent is 8-bits but with the most significant bit
clear.  The UART is looking for a particular pattern in order to accept
a byte, and the matching bit patterns exist in some bit streams at an
offset to what the transmitter intended.

Do you only test baud rate?  Other factors are number of bits in the
word, parity existence and polarity, and number of stop bits.  There can
be multiple working combinations.  There can be combinations that work
for most bytes read and then fail on one.  Verify the NMEA checksum.

Do you shut off the receiver before changing the baud rate?  Toggle
CREAD, read all data received in a second, flush, then change the baud
rate, then toggle CREAD back again.  This will reduce the chances of
unpredictable data; the flood gates will open in the middle of a bit
stream and the UART should resynchronise more predictably.
