<PRE>I figured out how to make the probe for SiRF-II work.

Turns out that $PSRF105,0 (debug messages off) doesn't elicit an $Ack Input105
*unless debug messages were previously turned on*.  Thus, what you actually 
have to send to get the ack is $PSRF105,1 (debug messages on).

Now that we can probe for SiRF-II, there is a SiRF-II driver (-T
s). This exists mainly so that it can have a new method,
sirf_switcher, to change speeds.  All other drivers, except Zodiac, 
have a null method for this.  The Zodiac driver has my best guess at
a speed switch in it.

Why all this work to support changing baud rates?  Because, it turns out,
they matter. 4800 is just a hair too slow to guarantee that all sentences
will be shipped within a 1-second cycle.

Here's the test procedure for baud-rate switching:

1. Reconfigure and rebuild with --enable-profiling

1. Start the daemon.

2. telnet localhost 2947 and type 'B' to see the current baud rate.

3. Type 'w' to verify that you can get sentences.

4. Now type B=9600 (or, if you're already at 9600, B=4800).

5. You should get a response that says &quot;B=9600 8 N 1&quot; (or &quot;B=4800 8 N 1&quot;).
   If the speed you see in the response is not the one you were trying to
   set, note this and report it.

6. Are you still getting sentences?  If not, the line speed dowesn't match the
   GPS speed.  Please note that and report it.

I'm particularly interested in the following questions:

1. Russ, and anyone else with a Zodiac GPS: does the experimental Zodiac 
   baud-rate switching work for you?

2. Chris Kuethe: I can't get baud-rate switching to work on my TripNav 200.
   You sent me a comment that implies the protype code I shipped last
   week worked on yours.  Does it atill?
