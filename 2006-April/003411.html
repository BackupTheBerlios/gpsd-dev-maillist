<PRE>Updated testing results for the patches I posted yesterday.  I've 
tested the patched gpsd+libgps with a Holux GM-210 (NMEA) USB GPS, 
using cgps (libgps, watcher mode), gpstoge (libgps, compound queries) 
and KisMAC (telnet, compound queries) as clients.  All clients now 
work exactly as expected.

NMEA sentence pattern from GPS unit (received every cycle unless 
otherwise noted):
$GPGGA
$GPGSA
$GPGSV x 3 (every fifth cycle)
$GPRMC

Cases tested:
- GPS unplugged -&gt; GPS plugged in
- no fix -&gt; 2D fix -&gt; 3D fix -&gt; 2D fix -&gt; no fix -&gt; 2D fix -&gt; 3D fix
- no fix -&gt; 3D fix -&gt; no fix
- unplug GPS mid-stream when position fixed (2D and 3D)

All clients now receive the mode that the GPS itself is reporting at 
all times, with no jitter between modes reported by gpsd, nor jitter 
in the presentation of data.  Altitude reported is that reported in 
the most recent GGA sentence at all times, and the mode indicator 
matches that reported by the most recent GSA sentence.  When the GPS 
is unplugged midstream, the daemon correctly reports the GPS as 
offline, and no further fix data is returned to clients.

That's pretty much all the testing I can do with the equipment I 
have, and as far as I can see it now functions 100% correctly.  One 
case that I can't test (either because my unit won't do it, or 
because I don't know how) is to turn off some or all of the NMEA 
sentences while the device is still connected.  Nothing I've done 
will change the behaviour of gpsd if all NMEA output ceases while the 
GPS is still connected.  The only thing which my recent work will 
change is what happens if one of the NMEA sentences is turned off 
mid-stream while the others are allowed to continue (N.B. prior to my 
initial logic fix, which repaired the incorrect discarding of 
altitude data, even that would have been erratic).  For example, if 
the GGA sentence were turned off midstream in the above pattern, then 
gpsd would continue to report the last altitude received in a GGA 
sentence, and continue reporting the mode as a 3D fix (provided the 
GPS was still receiving a 3D fix), implying that the altitude is a 
recent fix when in fact is is not.  Ditto for track/velocity 
information if the RMC sentence is turned off mid-stream.

However, those cases only occur in the event of either (a) GPS unit 
partial failure [connection good, output corrupted] or (b) manual 
interference by the GPS operator [who should know better than to 
screw around with NMEA sentence output in the middle of active GPS 
use]... and I'm not sure it is fair to expect gpsd to handle those 
circumstances.

In summary, I highly recommend the patches I posted yesterday to 
anyone using an NMEA GPS with gpsd and not currently getting the 
results out of gpsd that they should.  Folks with other types of GPS, 
I can't speak to that so much - I gather that SiRF-II binary GPS 
units are not affected by the bugs I've been working on (although the 
libgps patch is still worth applying if you want to use compound 
queries or to get correct mode indications from O queries or watcher 
mode).

Of course, any other feedback welcome, but I'm pleased to say that 
gpsd - at least on this computer - appears at last to be fully 
functional!

Cheers,
Robin
