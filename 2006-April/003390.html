You are looking at it the wrong way.
Lat/Lon are from one sentence (the first), Altitude from another (let's say 
the last). Let us assume that many sentences are enabled. Enough so that it 
takes 900ms for the complete batch.

What you see on a client: Lat/lon becomes valid.
About 900ms later Altitude becomes valid.
100ms later Lat/Lon gets updated. Lat/Lon was buffered for 1000ms.
At this time Altitude gets invalidated, after only being buffered for 100ms.

Why not allow Altitude 1000ms too?

All we have done is introduce jitter.

Commonly the gps cycle time is a second (for most sentences) But it takes a 
good fraction of that second to get all data across. What that boils down to 
is, that there is one second between updates of any one item.

Items should be allowed to live through *their* cycle time.

I feel a bit dense (flu), so I hope this makes as much sense to you as it does 
to me ;-)

Cheers,
Remco
