One thing I believe you're neglecting, however. Certain GPS receivers (like my 
Garmin 'GPS 35 TracPak') can be dynamically (re-)programmed (via PC --&gt; GPS 
NMEA-sentence commands) as to exactly what NMEA sentences they should 
transmit. If I (or some application) disable(s) a particular NMEA sentence, 
I'd probably expect 'gpsd' to react to that and begin to invalidate the 
unique (i.e. not reported in any other sentence that is currently being 
received by 'gpsd') content of that sentence. (Likewise, enabling a 
particular NMEA sentence should cause 'gpsd' to react to that and begin to 
validate _all_ that sentence's content.)

I'll admit that reprogramming the NMEA output of the GPS is a bit of a &quot;corner 
case&quot;, but it's definitely not unheard of and it seems to me like it should 
still be handled elegantly, since we can, with relative ease (I believe).

&gt;<i> &gt;A possibility would be to keep a &quot;last time received&quot; and &quot;last interval&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;for each class of data.  When an update arrives, the &quot;last interval&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;set to the current time - last time received, and last time received is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;set to the current time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;When no data arrives within last time received + 2 * last interval, we set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the corresponding values to invalid (NaN).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Such an algorithm would auto-adapt to the cycletime of the particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;receiver, and could handle different cycletimes for different classes of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notwithstanding my previous comment, that doesn't in itself sound
</I>&gt;<i> like a bad piece of *additional* functionality: the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> auto-sense when a receiver has experienced some kind of logic failure
</I>&gt;<i> and lower the reported quality of the PVT data.  In the mean time,
</I>&gt;<i> however, I think we should fix the *existing* functionality, which
</I>&gt;<i> currently produces falsely erratic daemon output from a perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> functional NMEA source.
</I>
I agree completely with you on this. I very much like Rob Janssen's 
auto-adapting idea and think it should be implemented. Having said that, the 
core problem should be fixed right away and if your patch accomplishes this, 
you have my full support (which, along with $1.00, will buy you a cup of 
coffee :^} ).

Finally, I want to say &quot;Thank you, Robin&quot; for taking the time to address this 
and actually implementing the patch. It is much appreciated!
