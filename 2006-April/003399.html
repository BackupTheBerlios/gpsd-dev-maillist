<PRE>&gt;<i>I'll certainly do some more testing here, and see if I observe any 
</I>&gt;<i>odd behaviour.
</I>
I've just done some further testing in a marginal signal environment 
(inside the side window of a building with eaves and cyclone screens 
outside).  The switch from fixed to non-fixed positions is still very 
clear from a client point of view.  The moment an RMC sentence is 
received with &quot;V&quot; rather than &quot;A&quot;, gpsd (correctly) returns ? values 
for P, A, etc:

pmavtqs
GPSD,P=?,M=1,A=?,V=?,T=?,Q=0 50.00 50.00 50.00 0.00 0.00,S=0

and of course for O as well:

o
GPSD,O=?

cgps and gpstoge both show switches from &quot;No fix&quot; to &quot;3D fix&quot; and 
back again as the RMC flag goes from V to A and back.

Around one such transition (fixed to not fixed) the raw output was:

Unfortunately, that's showed up one error in the output from gpsd - 
although the GSA sentences are reporting the fix quality as 2D, gpsd 
is telling the clients that it has a 3D fix.  Now this gets a little 
interesting - since GSA has no timestamp, it's only by context (that 
it arrives between two sentences with the same timestamp) that we can 
determine which cycle it fits into.  However, it seems reliably to 
follow GGA, which is the only sentence that can imply a 3D-quality of 
fix, so presumably something is happening that prevents GSA 
overriding the fix mode GGA has previously set.

I'll investigate further, but not right now.
