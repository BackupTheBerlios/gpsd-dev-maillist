<PRE>&gt;<i>Also, I'm
</I>&gt;<i>curious as to what Eric (ESR) has to say on this whole issue and am patiently
</I>&gt;<i>awaiting and looking forward to his &quot;design-considerations essay&quot;.
</I>
As are we all!

&gt;<i>  &gt; However, those cases only occur in the event of either (a) GPS unit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  partial failure [connection good, output corrupted] or (b) manual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  interference by the GPS operator [who should know better than to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  screw around with NMEA sentence output in the middle of active GPS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  use]... and I'm not sure it is fair to expect gpsd to handle those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I (amicably) disagree with the admonishment associated with point '(b)'. With
</I>&gt;<i>my Garmin 'GPS 35 TracPak' (UI-less, i.e. &quot;hockey-puck&quot;) receiver, you
</I>&gt;<i>actually *have to* &quot;screw around with NMEA sentence output in the middle of
</I>&gt;<i>active GPS use&quot;. That's the only way you can change the GPS' NMEA output, by
</I>&gt;<i>sending an NMEA message to the GPS while it's powered up (and therefore
</I>&gt;<i>transmitting useful NMEA data).
</I>
Point taken.  I should clarify my comment a little (and I accept that 
the admonishment was misplaced).  What I really meant was that if you 
have a client actually *depending* on the output of the GPS device at 
the same time as you change the output that device is sending, then 
you're generally asking for trouble.  Such a user should certainly 
know better than to remove an essential sentence on which that client 
(in this case, gpsd) depends.

In light of the above, is it realistic to suggest that gpsd should 
handle the case where the operator turns off an essential NMEA 
sentence mid-stream?  If so, I think we have to return to playing 
with the individual timeouts idea, which sounds very complicated and 
scary.  However, I can't see any compelling reason why we *should* 
handle that case: if you know enough to turn off essential sentences 
mid-use, then you should know enough to understand that gpsd can't 
give a reliable (insert parameter only found in that one sentence 
here) after you do so.

We await ESR's essay with interest!
