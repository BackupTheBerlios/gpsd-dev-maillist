With &quot;buffering&quot;, one could collect all data from a single fix (sent in
multiple messages from the receiver) in a single unit, and present it to
the clients (or make available for polling) as a consistent set.  So
position, velocity, error information etc all comes from a single fix.
Maybe it would be better called &quot;double buffering&quot; as there is one buffer
that holds a valid dataset for the clients, and one that is collecting the
next dataset from the receiver messages.

This is not the same as the buffer we have now, because that is updated
incrementally.  when it is not cleared at start of cycle it may hold a
position from one fix, and velocity from the previous fix, for example. 
(depending on the protocol in use, and the way it splits the data into
different message types)

As mentioned before, there are (at least) these issues with double buffering:
- it introduces a delay between what the receiver sends and what the
client sees
- it is difficult to know when you have collected all data the receiver
will send for this fix, especially when you want the abovementioned delay
to be small
- the cycletime may be different for each message type, so not all cycles
contain all data.  the decision whether to keep old data from previous
fixes needs to be made, including the issue of what to do when certain
data is no longer received (invalidate or keep last received value
forever).

A double-buffering mechanism in fact implemented in gpsd, but only between
the driver and the main fix buffer.  When gps_merge_fix is not called for
every message, and the message flags are somehow collected until the end
of the cycle, we would have the required buffer.  This is, however, not
easy to implement.
