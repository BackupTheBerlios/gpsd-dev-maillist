</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Full patch (for this particular set of issues) follows:

</I>&gt;<i> Please don't anyone commit this yet.  The buffering/frames/jitter issue

I think nobody is even close to committing anything.
I realize the complicated nature of the issue, trust me ;-)

&gt;<i> (There is also some misinformation floating around as to what I actually
</I>&gt;<i> did.  Remco, you weren't asleep.)
</I>
Would not have been the first time, but good to know that it's not a habit 
yet.

&gt;<i> I agree we need to have a serious design discussion about this and
</I>&gt;<i> aim at fixing it.  I'm not necessarily opposed to some form of buffering
</I>&gt;<i> in the daemon (as long as it can be switched off) but the issue of
</I>&gt;<i> how to do it and what constutes an appropriate buffering interval is
</I>&gt;<i> nasty, nasty, *nasty*.
</I>
When the time comes...

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I'm on an urgent, high-pressure, high-hourly-rate
</I>&gt;<i> consultung job and I can't spare the bandwidth right now (and trust me
</I>&gt;<i> again that if you knew what I was doing you would consider it more
</I>&gt;<i> important anyway).
</I>
You had to say that! Now I am dieing to know... Damn you :-)

&gt;<i> I expect to be able to claw free some time Wednesday or Thursday next
</I>&gt;<i> week, at which point my top priority will be to write a
</I>&gt;<i> design-considerations essay replying to this entire thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Until then, please have patience.
</I>
No problem. 

Go make some bucks...

Cheers,
Remco
