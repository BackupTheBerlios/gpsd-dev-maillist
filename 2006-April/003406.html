<PRE>&gt;<i>Unfortunately, that's showed up one error in the output from gpsd -

OK - results of further investigation:

gpsd is doing everything right (as far as I can tell).  Responses to 
the M query correctly identify 2D vs 3D fixes exactly as GSA reports 
them.  The problem is in how libgps interprets the O command (more 
specifically, that actual mode data is missing from the O command). 
So since both gpstoge and cgps use O output for their data (gpstoge 
with O queries, cgps with watcher mode), both of them incorrectly 
report the fix quality as 3D because the GPS is reporting altitude 
(as it does with a GGA sentence), even though gpsd knows the mode 
only to be 2D.

Now, I think it's wrong to throw any data out if the GPS unit is 
reporting it, so it shouldn't simply return A=? (or a ? in the 
altitude field of an O response) any time the mode is less than 3... 
however, we need to look at some way of informing clients using O 
queries or watcher mode that the altitude currently being reported by 
the GPS is not the result of a current 3D fix.

Any ideas?  I realise I'm relatively recent to this list, so I don't 
want to rehash something that's already been discussed at length. 
Without the benefit of possible previous discussion, I would suggest 
extending the output of the O command by one field, to include mode 
(0|1|2|3) at the end.  Any strenuous objections?  Any non-strenuous 
ones?

Now, that brings me to another issue which I think is actually a bug 
(and I'll be working on that now) - when I was initially developing 
it, I tried using a compound query in gpstoge (i.e. &quot;PAVTM\n&quot;), but 
discovered that it only ever got the data corresponding to the first 
(or actually, was it the last?) item in the query... and it's for 
that reason that I moved to using an O query in the first place. 
However, now that I'm more familiar with the internal workings of 
gpsd/libgps, I may actually be able to track down what precisely was 
going wrong, and why.

Watch this space!
