<PRE>OK - big subject line for what I think is a considerable collection 
of improvements for gpsd.

1) Following on from the discussion of recent days (under the old 
subject of &quot;Altitude not always being reported&quot;), I've now had time 
to work on and test a patch for altitude/track/velocity reporting (as 
posted a couple of days ago), which works well for me, and I would 
appreciate if anyone else could report if they find problems with it.

2) Testing (1) turned up a behavioural bug in how libgps determined 
mode from O or W responses (it regarded the presence of an altitude 
value as determining whether or not the fix was 3D, which is 
incorrect).  I've resolved that by extending the output of O by one 
field (the last field is now the mode, exactly as reported by the M 
command).

3) Working on (2) reminded me of a problem which I'd encountered 
during early development of gpstoge, that libgps did not properly 
parse the response to a compound query (e.g. &quot;pavtm\n&quot; as opposed to 
&quot;p\n&quot; or &quot;o\n&quot;).  This turned out to be a bug in the gps_unpack() 
function in libgps.c ... which I believe I've resolved (tested 
successfully with single and compound queries).

1 and 3 are essentially bug-fixes, however (as mentioned in my 
previous e-mail) I'd appreciate feedback as to whether my resolution 
of 2 seems reasonable/appropriate to everyone.  Bear in mind that 
since I've modified both libgps.c and gpsd.c, there's no need to do 
anything to make clients work with the new O output unless you've 
manually written a parser for it for some reason... and even then, it 
should work since it just extends the output by one field at the end.

Following this message will be the patches themselves, and following 
that will be a small request for help! :)

Cheers,
Robin
