Hi Charles,

As one of the participants in that discussion, let me try to address your 
question.

First, any chance you could take a screen capture of (just) the broken 'xgps' 
window and attach it? I don't know if this list would reject such an 
attachment, but you could CC: me, just in case. For example, I'm trying to 
understand if the Motif &quot;List&quot; widget is incorrectly rendered or if 'xgps' 
just isn't filling it up with all the proper content.

I'm running 'xgps' from 'gpsd-2.32' under Slackware 10.2, modified to replace 
LessTif with OpenMotif-2.2.2 (from the Slackware CD set). I have no problems 
with the 'xgps' display or any of the Motif widgets.

The bit about &quot;the sentence widget is truncated by the plot widget.&quot; sounds to 
me like you're using an old version of 'xgps'. IIRC, that's exactly what was 
happening before the patches to rearrange the Motif widgets. Please be sure 
that's not the case (try 'xgps -V').

Also, can you check your 'xgps' AppDefaults file. I don't use Fedora Core, but 
you'll probably find it somewhere like this (Slackware 10.2):

   /etc/X11/app-defaults/xgps

Does such a file exist? If so, please report the full content of that file. 
It's likely that it's exactly the same as the 'xgps.ad' file that's 
distributed with 'gpsd', and gets installed with 'make install', IIRC, but 
let's be sure.

&gt;<i> [<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">root at dragon</A> i386]# pre motif
</I>&gt;<i> openmotif-devel-2.3.0-0.1.9.2
</I>&gt;<i> openmotif-2.3.0-0.1.9.2
</I>
I wonder if your (newer) version of Motif is somehow causing a problem? 
Doubtful, but not impossible.

Lastly, assuming that you're truly running the latest version of 'xgps', is 
there any chance you can build and execute 'xgps' from the older versions of 
the 'gpsd' distribution? Obviously, that might help narrow the problem down.

It's hard to say what's going on here, but if you can supply a few of these 
details, we might have a good chance at solving the problem.

Good luck....

Bill Marr
