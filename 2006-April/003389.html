You have to keep values *buffered* till they get updated anyway. That still is 
done! The question is, when to invalidate values.

The original idea was to invalidate if they have not been updated for a time &gt; 
cycle time (or a &quot;reasonable&quot; time).

The current approach seems to be to invalidate everyting at the beginning of a 
new &quot;frame&quot;. The bad thing is, there is no such thing as a frame.

The original code tried to cope with situations when the gps broke, and did 
not send any data any more. As a side effect, it provided a jitter buffer.

The jitter we now suffer is self inflicted, and does not serve any purpose.

Consider two cases:

The working gps case: Values are valid till the gps updates them. Not 450ms, 
not 5 seconds. Until updated. Updated means: overwritten explicitly with new 
data from the gps, or invalidated by us when the gps looses the fix. Even 
then, we should provide the last valid value, but also flag the fact that fix 
was lost. 

The broken gps case: Values are valid until updated. If I cut the gps serial 
cable, updates will never happen. So we need to detect a timeout, and 
invalidate somehow. Maybe best just flag a lost fix, but keep the last valid 
values.

Did I get it about right? I believe, it used to be that way.

Cheers,
Remco
