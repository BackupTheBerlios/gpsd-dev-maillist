<PRE>&gt;<i> Now, here's my question to the dev-list: is there actually a reason
</I>&gt;<i> to cause GPSD to discard the last frame's data at the beginning of a
</I>&gt;<i> new frame?  We already have logic which prevents returning old data
</I>&gt;<i> to those queries if the device has lost its fix - otherwise, the most
</I>&gt;<i> correct answer (in the instant between a GGA and an RMC sentence) to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;where am I going&quot; is that information received from the *last* RMC
</I>&gt;<i> sentence, not &quot;I can't tell you&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In turn, the question arises: is there a reason to clear all data at
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;CYCLE_START_SET&quot; at all... and if there still is for other
</I>&gt;<i> protocols, should we update the NMEA handler to omit setting that
</I>&gt;<i> flag?
</I>
This has been discussed before, and I agree with you that the situation is
not optimal.
I suggested before that the entire dataset should be double-buffered, i.e.
a complete set of valid data should be kept to be returned in response to
queries, and a new set be prepared while decoding the messages and
transferred to the buffered set once it is complete.

One problem is that it is not really clear at what time the dataset is
complete.  This ony becomes obvious when new data appears that belongs to
a next set, and waiting for that would delay all fixes for one additional
cycletime (often one second).  This was deemed unacceptable by some
people.

Also, some receivers seem to send a new timestamp for each NMEA message,
and it would be difficult to find the set of messages that form a single
set without additional configuration.

The buffering that is in place now (the newdata struct, the update flags,
and the gps_merge_fix function) solved one particular problem, but they
clearly do not solve it in the general case.  It would be best when GPS
receivers returned all their fix data in a single message, but most of
them don't.  For example, the Trimble TSIP protocol uses even more
separate messages, and this causes even more trouble (which you seldomly
see reported because most users use NMEA or SIRF Binary).

Putting some thought into a general mechanism that makes sure that no
&quot;unknown&quot; (NAN) values are returned for data that IS available but not at
the current moment in the message cycle, while at the same time making
sure that stale data is never returned, could really help the project.
