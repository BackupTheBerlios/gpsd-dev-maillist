The proposed change doesn't affect that case at all: all I've done is 
remove the step where all data is cleared at the beginning of a 
cycle, and that is only called when a valid NMEA sentence with a new 
timestamp is received.  As Rob Janssen points out below, gpsd.c 
already handles the question of whether a currently-fixed signal is 
being received from the GPS.

&gt;<i>Yes, this is always an issue.

</I>
This would only happen in the case of a serious fault with the GPS 
receiver.  It doesn't seem fair to expect gpsd to provide a higher 
level of data integrity than the GPS receiver itself: if the GPS 
receiver goes haywire and starts reporting nothing but (for example) 
RMC sentences, then it doesn't seem reasonable to expect gpsd (as a 
relatively thin daemon) to be sufficiently intelligent to say &quot;hey - 
it's really been too long since I last saw a GGA sentence, and this 
particular receiver usually sends GGA sentences at the beginning of 
each cycle, so I think I should discard altitude data and lower the 
fix mode to 2D&quot;.

&gt;<i>A possibility would be to keep a &quot;last time received&quot; and &quot;last interval&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>for each class of data.  When an update arrives, the &quot;last interval&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i>set to the current time - last time received, and last time received is
</I>&gt;<i>set to the current time.
</I>&gt;<i>When no data arrives within last time received + 2 * last interval, we set
</I>&gt;<i>the corresponding values to invalid (NaN).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Such an algorithm would auto-adapt to the cycletime of the particular
</I>&gt;<i>receiver, and could handle different cycletimes for different classes of
</I>&gt;<i>data.
</I>
Notwithstanding my previous comment, that doesn't in itself sound 
like a bad piece of *additional* functionality: the ability to 
auto-sense when a receiver has experienced some kind of logic failure 
and lower the reported quality of the PVT data.  In the mean time, 
however, I think we should fix the *existing* functionality, which 
currently produces falsely erratic daemon output from a perfectly 
functional NMEA source.
