<PRE>Robin L Darroch &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">robin at spade-men.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I agree entirely.  Since I don't have commit access, would someone else like to put the diff patches into the SVN repository?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Full patch (for this particular set of issues) follows:
</I>
Please don't anyone commit this yet.  The buffering/frames/jitter issue
is more complicated than anyone here has yet realized -- trust me on
this, I've grappled with it a *lot*.

(There is also some misinformation floating around as to what I actually
did.  Remco, you weren't asleep.)

I agree we need to have a serious design discussion about this and
aim at fixing it.  I'm not necessarily opposed to some form of buffering
in the daemon (as long as it can be switched off) but the issue of 
how to do it and what constutes an appropriate buffering interval is
nasty, nasty, *nasty*.

Unfortunately, I'm on an urgent, high-pressure, high-hourly-rate
consultung job and I can't spare the bandwidth right now (and trust me
again that if you knew what I was doing you would consider it more
important anyway).  

I expect to be able to claw free some time Wednesday or Thursday next
week, at which point my top priority will be to write a
design-considerations essay replying to this entire thread.

Until then, please have patience.
