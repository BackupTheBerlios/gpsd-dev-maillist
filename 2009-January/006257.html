<PRE>Hi,

Remco Treffkorn:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Don't write before the previous write has finished.
</I>
That's easily accomplished by adding a select() to the write side of
that file descriptor after hitting a partial write ... which is one of
the solutions I originally proposed. It's not my personal preference,
obviously, but ...

&gt;<i> I thought that was what the ioctl was for. Just wondering what's going on with that.
</I>
rfcomm does not implement a &quot;real&quot; serial line. In particular, sending a
break, or changing line speed, doesn't actually do anything if I read
the kernel source correctly; of course I may have overlooked something.

&gt;<i> 2. Just toss the whole message, if it can not be completely written at
</I>&gt;<i> this time. There will be another soon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Easiest to implement :-P

&gt;<i> Adding the code you suggest is extremely complex for the general case.
</I>
I'd argue that the general case is what you should be concerned with.

The Unix semantics are clear enough. Any program that writes to
character devices on Unix needs to be able to cope with partial write()
calls (including the case which we see here, where the part that could
be written has a length of zero).

&gt;<i> A lazy developer making special assumptions to ease his life.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>See above -- IMHO gpsd is the lazy party, by making special assumptions
about the properties of the 'serial' lines it needs to write to.

Anyway, care to point me to some kind of documentation which states that
what the rfcomm driver does isn't legal ..?
