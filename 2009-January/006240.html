<PRE>When Remco Treffkorn handed me the gpsd baton in 2004, my first
significant act was to move the project from CVS to Subversion.  
At the time, Subversion was the cutting edge in version-control
systems, and a huge improvement over CVS.  The reason we're hosted
on Berlios is that it was the first major development site to offer
Subversion.

It's now nearly five years later, and while Subversion is still a
handy and effective tool the state of the art in version-control
systems has moved on.  Third-generation VCSes like bzr, git, and
Mercurial support disconnected operation -- the ability to do commits
on a local copy of the repo and then perform a history-preerving sync 
to a 'head' project repository.

I think this is an especially important capability for gpsd. We've had
developers in mid-ocean on oil tankers and in other remote locations
where Internet connectivity is spotty, slow, or nonexistent.  Chris
Kuethe and I have been thinking about moving the project to one of the
3Gs for some time, but were blocked by the lack of support for them on
Berlios.

Support for the 3Gs is about where support for Subversion was in 2004;
SourceForge, GoogleCode and other major sites don't have it, and
Berlios is a bit ahead of the curve once again.  They now offer 
both Mercurial and git, which I think are the two top choices in
this class both in terms of technical strength and popularity.
(bzr is a somewhat distant third.)

I am therefore requesting comments on the possibility of moving the
project repository to Mercurial or git.  A couple of things to note:

1. Either move will preserve history -- that is, the Subversion commit
history back to day one (indeed, back through the CVS history) will be
in the repo.

2. Mercurial and git are functionally quite similar and can be
gatewayed into each other; there are some minor issues near tags,
but nothing insoluble.

Are any active developers unable to install either of these?

If you have a preference between them, please state it with a
sentence or two of explanation.  

There's been some discussionof this on #gpsd.

I lean towards Mercurial because I already know it, I like the design,
and I like the fact that it's written in Python -- that means if it's
broke, I can probably wade in and fix it.  But I think I could
cheerfully live with git.

Bernd Zeimetz, our Debian packager who has been become active as a dev
lately, favors git.  He says the Debian packages for Mercurial are
rather broken.

Chris Kuethe generally likes the idea of disconnected operation 
but hasn't expressed a preference between these alternatives.

Pretty much everyone who has looked at both systems seems to
agree that (a) git is powerful, gnarly, and poorly documented, and
(b) Mercurial has an easier learning curve, is much better documented,
but is perhaps less powerful for projects with lots of branches
and complex relationships between repos.  

I'm not very worried about these differences.  Our devs are smart and
adaptable, and our project is relatively small.  Either tool would
probably do fine for us.

So the current core devs have open minds on this issue.  Tell us
what you think.

The IRS has become morally corrupted by the enormous power which we in
Congress have unwisely entrusted to it. Too often it acts like a
Gestapo preying upon defenseless citizens.
