Hi guys.

Eric, I never got the message you are replying to here.

I disagree with many things said in this thread, but they are besides the 
point.

As a solution to the current problem I suggested to just not write the 
message. Another one will be coming shortly...

This is where we should all be able to agree.

Off the point, strictly as a side node, and only my opinion:

I consider the bt driver broken. Bad craftsmanship. And yes, programs should 
be able to live with that, and with the above strategy we are.

Adding code with a higher complexity to an application than would be needed in 
the driver strikes me as a loosing proposition.

More inline:

No, not what I said. What special assumptions does gpsd make? A write fails. 
Let it fail.

&gt;<i> Matthias, you are certainly correct that, classically, Unix programs

</I>&gt;<i> failing to do this is lazy and shoddy work.
</I>
My point is a soft one, having to to with 'reasonable' expectations about what 
a driver 'should' provide. If you are doing something 'ordinary', something 
that seems 'normal' in the context of what one would 'expect' a driver to do, 
and it does not work, then you might blame the driver. I believe a driver 
should do what a group of 'average' developers 'expects' from it.

For example: Most everybody would agree that a serial driver that requires you 
to write a single character, then wait x milliseconds before the next can be 
written is not good. On the other side of things, almost nobody would blame a 
driver for not wanting to do a 4k write to a 300 baud port in one sitting.

There is no standard (I know of) that dictates what the relationship of buffer 
depth to bandwidth should be. I believe the phrase is &quot;make it reasonable'.

Please note: I am mot saying that this obligates the driver maintainer to do 
anything. This test is just to decide where effort is spent most efficiently.
 
&gt;<i> On the gripping hand, both PVT packets from GPS and DGPS packets going
</I>&gt;<i> to them are datagram-like.  No one of them is critical.  So simply
</I>&gt;<i> dropping a short write is, I think, better than introducing a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> complexity in an attempt to make the transmission reliable, especially
</I>&gt;<i> since actual reliability probaly isn't achievable.
</I>
I hope we can agree on that.

&gt;<i> I've added a brief discussion of this issue to the Hacking Guide in the
</I>&gt;<i> section on &quot;Architecture and how to hack it&quot;.  Please critique.
</I>
If you really want me to, I will do it.
But keep in mind: This is as close to religion as I ever will get. It's one of 
the few things people have found they can not argue with me about.

Cheers,
Remco
