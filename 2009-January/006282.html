see eric, you should be paying attention to this discussion... it's
system and protocol design. it just so happens that we're planning on
exchanging a bunch of floats and doubles, but this is stuff you enjoy!
;)

regarding an open spec, there are 3 existing formats I can think of as
being possibly acceptable: RINEX, BINEX and RT-IGS.
- RINEX is very well established, but it's a file-oriented format.
- RT-IGS is new and not widely deployed, but it's intended for
low-latency streaming applications.
- BINEX comes from the rather capable folks at UNAVCO and is &quot;designed
to grow and allow encapsulation of all ... GNSS-related data and
metadata as encountered, including next-generation GNSS.&quot;

so maybe we should think about trying to interoperate with some of
these existing tools.

&gt;<i> For upload, I wonder about integrity issues with anonymous submission,
</I>&gt;<i> but that's a separable issue.
</I>
That can be handled in a few ways:
1) you can only write to a receiver through the local control socket.
you'd have to be locally compromised to have bad data injected into
your receiver.
2) you don't have to download the ephemeris to an untrusted server.
chances are, people doing this would want their fleet of sensors to
phone home to their central controller system, rather than using a
public server.
3) even if users did use a public ephemeris server, they could do a
first-level consistency check by comparing against the published
almanacs. i'd think that would allow you to discard obviously-bad
ephemerides, and you could possibly check ephemerides obtained from
multiple servers against eachother.
