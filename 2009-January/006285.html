<PRE>Hello all,

I have recently become more interested in GPS systems and have been  
somewhat frustrated with the state of GPS on Mac OS X. I found GPSD  
and have admired the quality work that everyone has done. However, I  
could see that the current GPSD could be a barrier for many consumers  
or developers, such as myself, who might like to leverage GPSD to help  
along the state of GPS on Mac OS X. While many daemons need to be,  
well daemons, my naive view tells me that GPSD doesn't (always) need  
to be one on OS X. I could see it running as part of a framework of an  
application that wishes to support GPS devices, as a stand alone  
application launched by the user for applications that are GPSD  
clients, or as a launch agent (while still requiring installation it  
could be done in a particular user directory and session not requiring  
elevated privileges). As a consumer I greatly despise having to use  
installers for applications especially those that might install  
something like GPSD to make an application work. As a developer I  
don't mind much, it's par for the course, but I would like to  
hopefully see things improve.

While reading the hackers guide to GPSD I came across the libusb  
section that told me GPSD might entertain such a crazy idea as mine.  
It stated,

&quot;There has been talk of revisiting libusb as a more reliable way to  
communicate with Garmin receivers. By implementing the driver in user  
space with libusb, we gain portability and freedom from buggy kernel  
modules. It may also offer us a way to better support OS X. It's not a  
dead issue any more.&quot;

I would love to see serial driver kext's on Mac OS X go away when it  
comes to USB GPS receivers, but I understand that supporting devices  
directly would be a huge undertaking. I would probably prefer OS X  
support be through IOKit but could understand a reason to use  
something that might benefit everyone. I would still be interested in  
the ideas brought forth above without direct USB support and staying  
with serial USB and bluetooth on OS X. I look forward to your feedback  
and thoughts.

Sincerely,
Michael
