I see that root is required for a separate control channel recognizing  
&quot;add device&quot; and &quot;remove device&quot;. What other features require it?

This sounds good. I will keep an eye out for the formation of this  
functionality. I will be happy to help out for OS X.

&gt;<i> As a user, I wish for my OS to provide qualified drivers without much

</I>&gt;<i> is stable, it should be in the kernel - not all of my PL2303 devices
</I>&gt;<i> are GPS receivers. I don't want to have to run a separate little glue
</I>&gt;<i> app for each one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I may have misunderstood...
</I>
No, I don't think you have misunderstood I may have not be as explicit  
as I could have been. What I believe I was trying to say, re: RS-232  
kext, was I would love to never see a third party RS-232 kext again  
but I understand this is not reality. Especially for the simple usb- 
serial converters for which you mentioned. This isn't Apple's fault  
nor any other operating system. No, I blame the USB specification for  
not providing for a serial port (RS-232) like HID descriptor. It seems  
odd to me that Bluetooth got this and not sure why USB did not, I  
don't claim to be a USB expert, but that's the way it is. I think the  
solution would be to adopt for GPS USB devices a standard interface  
instead of putting everything through RS-232.

In any case back to the topic at hand. It sounds very possible that  
with a few modifications I can move towards the idea I have in my head  
of a more OS X consumer friendly GPSD, or at least more versatile. Let  
me know if there is anything I can do. I saw someone talk about  
getting GPSD to be launchd capable a few years back but it doesn't  
look like that came to fruition. I might start there.

Sincerely,
Michael
