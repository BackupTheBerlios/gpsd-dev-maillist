<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I have a program that does gps_open and then registers a callback.  If
</I>&gt;<i> it has not gotten a valid fix in a while it closes via gps_close and
</I>&gt;<i> reopens.  This leaks threads.  The docmentation is ambiguous, but I
</I>&gt;<i> interpret it to say that gps_close should clean up the state on the gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> side.  So I think we need to either:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   have gps_close do the equivalent of gps_del_callback, and explain this
</I>&gt;<i>   in the man page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   document that one must delete all callbacks before calling gps_close,
</I>&gt;<i>   and that behavior is undefined if one hasn't been deleted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   have gps_open/close count the outstanding callbacks
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   (probably) Call abort(3) if there are stray callbacks so people can
</I>&gt;<i>   fix their (newly defined to be) buggy code rather than ending up with
</I>&gt;<i>   100 threads.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I ran into this on Linux/arm11, where each thread is a process and it
</I>&gt;<i> ran the machine out of slots in the process table.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My preference is for the first option.
</I>
I have examined the code and thought about what it would take to
implement your first option.  I agree it would be elegant, but it
would also raise the complexity and internal statefulness of the
libgps implementation rather more than makes me happy to think
about. The handler structures would have to be stored in a malloc
array, iterated over and closed only if the thread isn't already
dead...there are plenty of niggling edge cases to trip us up here.

I'd do it anyway if I thought multiple monitor threads per GPS were
going to be a common use case - but I wrote the API to support that on
general principles only. I can't realistically imagine an application
needing more than one.

Because I think that's true, I don't see a lot of payoff in the
second alternative for the amount of additional code it would require.
I think this is one of those cases where the right thing to do is
keep the API minimalist and loudly say &quot;Caveat thread-user!&quot; in the
documentation.

&gt;<i> Sort of related, what is the equivalent of NULL for pthread_t?  It seems
</I>&gt;<i> it's often a pointer and NULL probably works, but what does POSIX say?
</I>
No clue, alas.  I know very little about pthreads.  Maybe someone else on
the list can answer,

Note: I've merged your X-related patches, they'll be in 2.38.
