</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a program that does gps_open and then registers a callback.  If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it has not gotten a valid fix in a while it closes via gps_close and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reopens.  This leaks threads.  The docmentation is ambiguous, but I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpret it to say that gps_close should clean up the state on the gpsd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side.  So I think we need to either:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   have gps_close do the equivalent of gps_del_callback, and explain this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   in the man page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   document that one must delete all callbacks before calling gps_close,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   and that behavior is undefined if one hasn't been deleted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   have gps_open/close count the outstanding callbacks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   (probably) Call abort(3) if there are stray callbacks so people can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   fix their (newly defined to be) buggy code rather than ending up with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   100 threads.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I ran into this on Linux/arm11, where each thread is a process and it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ran the machine out of slots in the process table.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My preference is for the first option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have examined the code and thought about what it would take to
</I>&gt;<i> implement your first option.  I agree it would be elegant, but it
</I>&gt;<i> would also raise the complexity and internal statefulness of the
</I>&gt;<i> libgps implementation rather more than makes me happy to think
</I>&gt;<i> about. The handler structures would have to be stored in a malloc
</I>&gt;<i> array, iterated over and closed only if the thread isn't already
</I>&gt;<i> dead...there are plenty of niggling edge cases to trip us up here.
</I>
I see your point.

&gt;<i> I'd do it anyway if I thought multiple monitor threads per GPS were
</I>&gt;<i> going to be a common use case - but I wrote the API to support that on
</I>&gt;<i> general principles only. I can't realistically imagine an application
</I>&gt;<i> needing more than one.
</I>
I was intending to have only one.  The problem happened as I repeatedly
did open/add_callback/close when I got no fixes (indoors).

&gt;<i> Because I think that's true, I don't see a lot of payoff in the
</I>&gt;<i> second alternative for the amount of additional code it would require.
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is one of those cases where the right thing to do is
</I>&gt;<i> keep the API minimalist and loudly say &quot;Caveat thread-user!&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.
</I>
Surely you are only talking about the second and third parts - the
requirement to delete callbacks is unintuitive and really needs to be
documented (I can send a patch if you are inclined to take it).

I'm a big fan of detecting and aborting on interface contract violations
- failure of libgps to behave according to my expectations resulted in
several systems getting wedged.  It seems easy enough to count.

&gt;<i> Note: I've merged your X-related patches, they'll be in 2.38.
</I>
Thanks.  I'll look at my outstanding other local changes (in a private
svn) and probably need to send in some more.
