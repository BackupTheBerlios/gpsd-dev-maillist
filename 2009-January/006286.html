Thanks, we try...

&gt;<i> However, I

</I>&gt;<i> or developers, such as myself, who might like to leverage GPSD to help
</I>&gt;<i> along the state of GPS on Mac OS X. While many daemons need to be,
</I>&gt;<i> well daemons, my naive view tells me that GPSD doesn't (always) need
</I>&gt;<i> to be one on OS X. I could see it running as part of a framework of an
</I>&gt;<i> application that wishes to support GPS devices, as a stand alone
</I>&gt;<i> application launched by the user for applications that are GPSD
</I>&gt;<i> clients, or as a launch agent (while still requiring installation it
</I>&gt;<i> could be done in a particular user directory and session not requiring
</I>&gt;<i> elevated privileges).
</I>
The only privilege gpsd really requires is the permission to read the
tty. Write access is nice, but not necessary - I often run gpsd as an
unprivileged user for testing. Root permissions are needed for some
additional features, but they're not needed for gpsd's core mission as
a gps-to-tcp multiplexer.

Our view of gpsd is that it can be fire-and-forget. Start it at boot
time and then you can assume the existence of a gpsd. Hot-plug devices
are on our priorities list. It should be possible to attach a device
after gpsd has started, and gpsd should cope with device removal. I
think we see gpsd forming a critical part of this framework. Your OS's
hotplug facilities can tell gpsd that a serial device has been
attached/detached. GPSD then probes this device to see if it's a
usable gps. Your user app just has to connect to localhost:2947, and
you'll get whatever location information there is - if any.

&gt;<i> As a consumer I greatly despise having to use
</I>&gt;<i> installers for applications especially those that might install
</I>&gt;<i> something like GPSD to make an application work. As a developer I
</I>&gt;<i> don't mind much, it's par for the course, but I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully see things improve.
</I>
As a user, I wish for my OS to provide qualified drivers without much
effort on my part. I don't think that's too much to ask. Generally the
BSDs and Linux get it right... one would hope that given its heritage,
OS X should do the same.

&gt;<i> While reading the hackers guide to GPSD I came across the libusb
</I>&gt;<i> section that told me GPSD might entertain such a crazy idea as mine.
</I>&gt;<i> It stated,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;There has been talk of revisiting libusb as a more reliable way to
</I>&gt;<i> communicate with Garmin receivers. By implementing the driver in user
</I>&gt;<i> space with libusb, we gain portability and freedom from buggy kernel
</I>&gt;<i> modules. It may also offer us a way to better support OS X. It's not a
</I>&gt;<i> dead issue any more.&quot;
</I>
The garmin protocol seems too complicated to reliably implement in the
kernel, at least not without way more attention than it's been
getting. I guess PPP and ipv6 are just as complicated, but they have
more people who care. The garmin driver is under-loved. In this case a
libusb driver might be a better way to handle it.

&gt;<i> I would love to see serial driver kext's on Mac OS X go away when it
</I>&gt;<i> comes to USB GPS receivers, but I understand that supporting devices
</I>&gt;<i> directly would be a huge undertaking. I would probably prefer OS X
</I>&gt;<i> support be through IOKit but could understand a reason to use
</I>&gt;<i> something that might benefit everyone. I would still be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> the ideas brought forth above without direct USB support and staying
</I>&gt;<i> with serial USB and bluetooth on OS X. I look forward to your feedback
</I>&gt;<i> and thoughts.
</I>
Perhaps I'm being a little bold by saying &quot;serial driver kext's will
never go away&quot;. Every other OS has them - maybe just by a different
name. FreeBSD has loadable device driver modules, Linux has loadable
device driver modules, Windows has 'em... my preferred development
(OpenBSD) doesn't, but there is still in-kernel support for usb-serial
devices.

Where is the right place for such a driver? To my way of thinking the
answer is: wherever you can put it to present a standard interface to
the greatest number of consumer apps.

As an example of this, I think a separate app/daemon that uses libusb
and writes to a pty would be a great way to support the garmin
devices. The termios interface is standard, and libusb is too. A
separate app makes it possible to debug more easily and restart the
affected subsystem. Because it has such a narrow scope, this driver
would work well as a userland daemon. I'd say that for more generic
devices like simple usb-serial converters, they should go in the
kernel since they're mostly stable... alas, OS X users trying to use
PL2303 devices know this is not the case. Once such a generic driver
is stable, it should be in the kernel - not all of my PL2303 devices
are GPS receivers. I don't want to have to run a separate little glue
app for each one.

Perhaps I may have misunderstood...

Regards,
CK
