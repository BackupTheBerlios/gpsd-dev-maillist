<PRE>After an IRC-mediated debugging session, Jeff Francis and I managed to
get both gpsd and the -b and -n modes of gpsctl working on a serial
Garmin GPS.  We'd appreciate it if anyone with a USB Garmin would test
Subversion head to make sure it's doing the right things.

Since I issued a diktat about building GPS setting-tweakers recently
and got some pushback about that (from Gary Miller on-list, and from
Chris Kuethe by IRC), it is worth noting that the problems making
gpsctl work turned out to reflect two driver-level bugs that we found
only because I scrapped garminctl and garreset and *insisted* we had 
to make gpsctl work.

This sort of thing is exactly why I wanted to stamp out code
duplication and do everything through our driver architecture.  If you
have two copies of a way to do task X in a codebase even as relatively
small as gpsd's, they're going to drift apart, and one of them will
rot, and often you'll take too long to notice the rot because you're
only testing one of the variants regularly.  

That's exactly what happened here, and it's because I *expect* this
sort of glitch that I get on a high horse about doing things *right*.

Anyway, this is our last pre-release blocker.  If any of you know of any
other issues that you thing need to be addressed before we ship 2.39,
now's the time to speak.

The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus by the Supreme
Being as his father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the
fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.
