Hi,

You pruned this quite aggressively, which makes it harder to respond.

This is covered under &quot;or your peak usage is bigger than the tx buffer&quot;.
More information about how exactly the resource is limited does not help.

I thought that was what the ioctl(4, TCSBRK, 0x1) took care of? Has been many 
years, but I seem to remember that is what it does.

&gt;<i> Bluetooth bandwidth in itself is sufficient. The driver simply cannot
</I>&gt;<i> coalesce write calls (either because the driver's author was lazy, or
</I>&gt;<i> because some protocols you run over BT serial profile need to preserve
</I>&gt;<i> packet boundaries; I suspect the latter).
</I>
To work around this you suggest we buffer remaining data for an arbitrary 
amount of time and an arbitrary number of buffers, and we add quite a bit of 
complexity to the select loop.

&gt;<i> I am not going to hack the kernel Bluetooth serial code to add an
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary number of send buffers just for gpsd. That way lies madness.
</I>
I don't blame you, but that would be the right thing to do.
Since it is *not* just for gpsd. Not fixing it there means every application 
that transmits data via this channel has to solve the problem for itself. And 
don't tell me gpsd is the only app having that problem. 

&gt;<i> -EAGAIN means &quot;try again later&quot;, and that's exactly what gpsd should do.
</I>
It means you may try again later, not you must try again later.

Maybe I should have been more verbose the first time. I wanted to point out a 
few alternatives:

1. Don't write before the previous write has finished. I thought that was what 
the ioctl was for. Just wondering what's going on with that.

2. Just toss the whole message, if it can not be completely written at this 
time. There will be another soon.

3. Coalesce everything that belongs together into a single write. Slot problem 
solved, as long as your bandwidth assumption is correct. (Rats! This is where 
knowing more about how the resource is constrained does actually help. O 
well ;-)

4. Fix the BT serial code (by means of a bug report).

5. I am sure there is more...

Adding the code you suggest is extremely complex for the general case. It can 
be made less so by making special case assumptions, which I am not a fan of. 
That's what created the problem to start with. A lazy developer making 
special assumptions to ease his life.

Or maybe it's simply a bug...

Cheers,
Remco
