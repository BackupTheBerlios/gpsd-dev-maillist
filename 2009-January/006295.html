Luckily there aren't many usb-serial drivers in actual wide use - or
that's how it feels to me. Maybe I've been lucky that every serial
communication device I've plugged in has been Prolific, FTDI, SiLabs
or CDC-ACM.

I'm of the mind that all usb-serial is not expressive enough. You
cannot accurately emulate control lines over usb... or at least not
well enough for use as a time server.

&gt;<i> But, I think for gpsd there is a key difference.  Here's my take:

</I>&gt;<i>  drivers to talk to a USB serial device as if it is a serial port are
</I>&gt;<i>  the responsibility of the operating system.  This is either CDC-ACM,
</I>&gt;<i>  or PL2303X, or something else
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  interpreting that data belongs within gpsd.  It seems there is some
</I>&gt;<i>  garmin module for linux that does more than just be a serial driver,
</I>&gt;<i>  and that seems odd to me.
</I>
That particular garmin protocol is bi-directional and interactive. The
gps and the host software send messages and the other side is required
to acknowledge receipt of that message. While tools to speak the
garmin protocol do exist, it's obviously a less trivial exercise than
spewing NMEA messages back and forth. I suppose one could accuse that
driver of being an ugly layering violation.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
