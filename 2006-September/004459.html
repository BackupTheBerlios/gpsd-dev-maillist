Yay for version control.

Can I have a flag to inhibit reconfiguration?

Something that just occurs to me: gpsd disables raw tracker data after
it gets the leap second offset - behaviour I don't like, because it
makes my receiver give me less information. Rather than disabling it,
just set a flag internally to not bother parsing the raw tracker data
any more. The serial link is fast enough to handle with it: enabling
raw tracker data with my tools or with SiRFdemo causes the port speed
to be cranked up to at least 38400, possibly 57600. To cope with the
case of clock status, almanac, ephemerides, and software version,
howzabout we then set an internal flag to poll for these quantities.
You get your speed hack and zero administration, I still get my raw
data with R=2. Clock status would be most useful if it was set to 1Hz
though. To ensure that, we'd have to adjust the message rate, and
that's a hardware reconfiguration, and that's not something I want to
do without user consent.

Maybe a protocol command to toggle the gps between maximum chattiness
and typical use? That'd require a lot more knowlege about all the NMEA
variants though, and enabling the right magic. Much as I like
plaintext protocols like NMEA, I do kinda like the packed binary
messages for efficiency.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
