You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink....

</I>
So, then how about we split the difference.  Your ideal is 0.675, mine is
0.125.  So how about 0.400?    Although with a 500mS lock range that
only gives me 0.225 of pull in which is a bit on the edge.

&gt;<i> I would not assume that everyone has suitable internet connectivity on
</I>&gt;<i> their system.  Especially because one of the reasons for having a local
</I>&gt;<i> time receiver is to cover the case of no internet connectivity.
</I>
I do not assume that.  Please do not put words in my mouth that I did
not say nor ever even thought.  You want a straw man then bring your
own.

But I know that ntpd always needs calibration at least once.  If a
user can not get his system calibrated at least once then all bets are
off.  The off by one second issue can be solved once just by using a
broadcast radio listening to a time source accurate to one second.

&gt;<i> &gt; Mine is only 125mS off.  The fudge in the gpsd code is the one that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assumes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 675mS off!   Remove the 675mS fudge in the gpsd code and my 125mS looks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very good.  It even passes your +/- 400mS test nicely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You keep assuring that 125ms offset is the norm, without providing any
</I>&gt;<i> evidence.
</I>
Never.  I have said that MY system is solid at 0.125.  Feedback from
other users of GPS-18/LVC have reported similar values.  Unlike you I do
not assert in anyway that what I see is the norm.

I would rather remove the assumption of 0.125, 0.675, or any other value
from the code.  You want to keep assumptions in the code.  Although I
might be able to live with an assumption of 0.400.

&gt;<i> All my testing always yielded in excess of 500ms offset.
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like you are after solving your own problem, but do not care
</I>&gt;<i> about other situations.
</I>
Look in the mirror.

&gt;<i> &gt; The fudge in gpsd and the fudge in ntpd are added.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the suggestion is to adjust the one in ntpd.
</I>
Yes, and then to let ntpd decide whether to use the PPS or not.

&gt;<i> But when the difference added in ntpd is more than the allowed offset in
</I>&gt;<i> the pps monitor, there will be no pps lock.
</I>&gt;<i> with your receiver.  You can solve that by lowering the 0.675 to e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 0.500.
</I>
Sure I can solve it for me.  We are trying to get a way that works for
everyone.  2 other GPS-18/LVC users in the last week.

And .500 will not work for me.  That only give me a .025 lock range!
(0.500 - 0.400 = 0.100 lock edge, and ideally I am at 0.125, so a 0.025
lock range).

&gt;<i> As I have said before, NMEA is unsuitable for time sync.  But people keep
</I>&gt;<i> trying.
</I>
You dispute my 0.019ppm?  Looks pretty damn good to me and the price is
right!  Maybe if you upped your baud rate fro 4800 baud you would get
better results too.
