<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I'm interested in starting gpsd with launchd(8), on Mac OS X.  This  
is the preferred method.  Several of the features that have been  
added to gpsd, in the last year, do not work well with the intentions  
of launchd(8).

launchd(8) has been released by Apple, under the Apache License,  
Version 2.0.  More information can be found at:  <A HREF="http://">http://</A> 
launchd.macosforge.org/ .  launchd(8) replaces init, mach_init,  
xinetd, RC, SystemStarter, watchdog, and cron, on Mac OS X.  Some of  
these subsystems (Vixie Cron, xinetd, etc.) are still available, and  
are themselves launched by launchd(8).

This is from the man page of launchd(8), regarding what it expects of  
items started with it:

&quot;EXPECTATIONS
      Daemons or agents managed by launchd are expected to behave  
certain ways.

      A daemon or agent launched by launchd MUST NOT do the following  
in the
      process directly launched by launchd:

            o   fork(2) and have the parent process exit(3) or _exit(2).
            o   Call daemon(3)

      A daemon or agent launched by launchd SHOULD NOT do the  
following as a
      part of their startup initialization:

            o   Setup the user ID or group ID.
            o   Setup the working directory.
            o   chroot(2)
            o   setsid(2)
            o   Close &quot;stray&quot; file descriptors.
            o   Change stdio(3) to /dev/null.
            o   Setup resource limits with setrusage(2).
            o   Setup priority with setpriority(2).
            o   Ignore the SIGTERM signal.

      A daemon or agent launched by launchd SHOULD:

            o   Launch on demand given criteria specified in the XML  
property
                list.  More information can be found in launch(3).
            o   Catch the SIGTERM signal.&quot;

The items above, that launchd(8) requests daemons/agents SHOULD NOT  
do, are listed, because they are controlled by launchd(8), based on  
parameters given to it, in the XML property list used to launch the  
item.

I understand why some of of the design choices were made with gpsd.   
I don't believe there is a flag or method for gpsd, to NOT do some of  
the items above.  I'm requesting a startup flag, or compile option,  
related to it running under launchd(8), that would allow it to behave  
as launchd(8) prefers.

Does this sound realistic?  If so, would it require too much effort?   
If the above requirements &amp; desirables are doable, I'll submit a gpsd  
XML property list for launchd(8).  Otherwise, I'll continue to launch  
it as a SystemStarter item, until SystemStarter is finally removed  
from Mac OS X (it's already deprecated).  If anyone has questions  
regarding launchd(8), I'd be glad to send additional information and  
links to other resources.

Thanks,
Frank
