Yo Chris!

BTW, I clearly see this as a port 2.34 issue.

When I did parsers in assembly I would care about this.  Not now.
Even CKermit could do shortest unambiguous match.   Over the 4800
baud link keeping it short is important, but once we are running
at TCP/IP speeds to cgps speed is not an issue.

I see no way to make it back compatible to the old stacked single letters
so we might as well do it the best we see fit.

&gt;<i> &gt; Makes it easy to stream the data.  Could work.  Might be nice to also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow for -2.  So a line ending of CR, or CR/LF works.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> simplicity and easy format tests.
</I>
You just know someone will grab this data with a CR/LF instead of a
LF then wonder why things are broken.

Of course all this would be trivial with a few REGEXP, but I am sure the
embedded folks would kill us if we did that. :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Or how about just allow the ; anywhere in the buffer, then you can stack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more than one item on a line or in a buffer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought about that too. Hence point 3. But the parser would be
</I>&gt;<i> simpler if we didn't have to cope with that. The protocol would be
</I>&gt;<i> more useful if we could.
</I>
Just use a strchr() in a while() loop  to chop the string at each ';'.

&gt;<i> &gt; I prefer protocols I can fit on an editor.  Much easier to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regressions and checks by hand.  I like what SMTP does in its headers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lines less then 76 preferred and 256 max.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean you prefer protocols where you can fit the MTU into one
</I>&gt;<i> screenful, preferably one line? I was thinking the same. First I
</I>&gt;<i> though 80 characters, then I though maybe 256 if we're uploading an
</I>&gt;<i> hexdump of an ephemeris, and then I though I might want more. But I
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to go bounded. Either a one-time malloc buffer or a static
</I>&gt;<i> buffer. I'm tempted to allow 4K, because that's a modern memory page.
</I>
I can see the empheris issue.  So I could go with &lt;76 bytes long
preferred and &lt;4096 mandatory.

&gt;<i> &gt; One per line means you can easily parse lines with simple parsers.  But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the trend to the long line is already set in gpsd.  So I would allow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mix/match.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ie. you're voting for multiple commands per line. gpsd does indeed
</I>&gt;<i> support multiple commands in the single character command set. As this
</I>&gt;<i> is a new command protocol, I don't feel any pressing urge to do the
</I>&gt;<i> same thing. I was thinking about parser simplicity, and the extended
</I>&gt;<i> protocol is going to be complicated enough.
</I>
I much prefer one command per line.  Much easier to debug.  But eric
has been moving the other way.  If we allow commands to stack on ';',
like in SQL, then each person can do it his way.

&gt;<i> I think we should reserve commands of the form &quot;GPSD[A-Z]&quot; which map
</I>&gt;<i> to the version 3 single character commands. I guess that's another
</I>&gt;<i> argument in favor of stackable commands.
</I>
I like that.  That would be a nice gesture to allow quick upgrading of
clients while opening the door to major updates as well.
