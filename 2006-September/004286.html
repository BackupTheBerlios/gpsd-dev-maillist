</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I doubt that it is the cause, but the last change gary made to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ntpshm.c is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; broken.  Try to revert 1 version and see if that fixes it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (I don't think so, it will probably only log garbage)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not my change, that was Eric's.  I have not touched that code in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long time and the breakage is recent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, Gary is correct.
</I>
I was referring to the change to ntpshm.c logged in subversion as
Modified Wed Aug 30 21:28:39 2006 UTC (10 days, 11 hours ago) by garyemiller

I thought that was Gary...

Combined with the above comment (not touched that code in a long time), I
would like to make a small suggestion.
I have digged through the latest diffs to the PPS handling in an attempt
to help with the current problem, and I found quite some small changes
like the above.
I can understand that people sometimes add a debug line, or change some
part of the code because they first feel it is broken, and then later find
the problem really lies somewhere else, and then fix that.
However, from the subversion history it seems that often the full set of
changes (including experiments) is checked in.  Then often a next checkin
follows that changes those changed lines again, to satisfy the splint
program.

I would suggest to, when a problem has been identified and fixed, checkin
only the actual fix of the problem and not all the casual changes.  At
least that is what I am doing myself.  I keep a copy of the latest
checked-out version, edit my own version, and when I am finished I make a
diff and see which of my changes were really required and which were only
*attempts* to debug or fix something.  I rollback what was not required
and send the remainder off to Eric to check it in.

IMHO this method reduces the chances of inadvertently breaking things and
makes it easier to find the real changes in the subversion history.
