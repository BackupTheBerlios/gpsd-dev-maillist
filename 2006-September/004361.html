<PRE>It was a good weekend: I now have working decoders for SiRF messages
14 and 15 (almanac and ephemeris, respectively). They work on LE32,
LE64 and BE64 platforms. I've also got a decoder for the 50bps data
stream well under way: it handles synchronization and polarity,
decodes the handover word and can extract leap seconds. And it's quite
efficient - ie. gprof says it uses slightly more CPU than the sirf
message checksum routine. I haven't tested it for speed on my zaurus
(400MHz ARM xScale) yet - once I do I'll post results. Still, it's all
bit shifts, bit mask and bitwise-or and a couple of bitwise-xor.

Assuming 1 instruction* per clock, a back-of-the-envelope calculation
says that it's computational complexity is about 1/14th that of an rc4
key setup. Given that in C, i can do 17500 rc4 key setups per second
on my zaurus, the same back of the envelope numbers say that I should
be able to process 245000 subframes per second.

4101 insn = optimized rc4 key setup
282 insn = NAV message subframe cleanup

* instruction = {add, incr, or, xor, shift, &lt;,  ==, =}

Given these preliminary successes, I think it may soon be time to make
gpsd start parsing the NAV stream, when available - probably after
next release. There are a couple of caveats. Processing time will
increase as we extract more quantities from the NAV message. Such is
life. It also seems there are several data formats in use that we may
need to cope with:

1) raw 30 bit words stored in a uint32. you get to strip the parity
and fix polarity yourself
2) 30 bit words stored in a uint32, but with the parity decoded,
polarity may be inverted
3) 30 bit words stored in a uint32, but with the parity decoded,
polarity corrected
4) a stream of 30 bytes, expressing the 240 information-bearing bits, MSB-first
5) a stream of 60 characters, which are a hexdump of (4) above

SiRF messages are type 2 or 3 with newer firmwares doing 3, uBlox
seems to lean toward 3. Luckily the polarity detection and inversion
is quick and easy. The rest, we can handle in the device drivers.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
