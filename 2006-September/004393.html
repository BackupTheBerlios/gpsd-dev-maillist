Commited.

We both agree on that.  See below for another idea.

&gt;<i> I would rather count &quot;GPS-18/LVC&quot; as one case, and all the other NMEA

</I>&gt;<i> about users of other receivers?
</I>
I guess you missed the messages from Tim Cwik earlier this week.  He
has a Garmin GPS-18/LVC running at 4800 baud.  His real offset from
PPS to NMEA time worked out to 0.525.  So you see it is more to do
with baud rate than model #.

Maybe we can come up with a baud adjustment to adjust a starting guess
offset.  How about 600mS at 4800bps, 375ms at 9600 150mS at 19200 and
above?

&gt;<i> &gt; And .500 will not work for me.  That only give me a .025 lock range!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (0.500 - 0.400 = 0.100 lock edge, and ideally I am at 0.125, so a 0.025
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lock range).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even with a 25ms range there should be no problem, as ntpd will keep the
</I>&gt;<i> time well within such a tolerance.  Only when your receiver sometimes has
</I>&gt;<i> 100ms offset, it will go out of range.  But that would only confirm my
</I>&gt;<i> standpoint that NMEA messages are not really suitable for time sync, as
</I>&gt;<i> their offset from the real time is too variable.
</I>
I do not agree with your reasoning here.  Make the generous assumption
that the NMEA wanders +/- 100mS. in a random walk. gpsd would lock out
all pulses from -100 to -25mS of the PPS, about 1/3 of them. ntpd would
thnpe note the PPS as unreliable and knock it off the list.

We have got to get the NMEA time to stay in the not locked out window
for the PPS.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As I have said before, NMEA is unsuitable for time sync.  But people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; keep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; trying.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You dispute my 0.019ppm?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 0.019 ms you mean?
</I>
No. 0.019ppm.  Or, since you missed it when I sent it to this list earlier
this week.  After a few more days settling I got down t0 0.009 ppm.
Here is my &quot;ntpdc -c sysinfo&quot;:

ntpdc&gt; sysinfo
system peer:          SHM(1)
system peer mode:     client
leap indicator:       00

authdelay:            0.000002 s

Notice the 0.009 ppm stability!

&gt;<i> No way you are getting that with NMEA!
</I>
With pps of course, but only after I can keep the PPS in the NMEA lockout
window.

&gt;<i> You are using PPS pulses, that is an entirely different mechanism running
</I>&gt;<i> in parallel with the clunky NMEA method that we have difficulty getting
</I>&gt;<i> within 500 ms for everybody...
</I>
And there you have the problem, which is why we are trying to find a
solution for the window.  We get the right second with NMEA and let
PPS pull in the rest of the ay.
