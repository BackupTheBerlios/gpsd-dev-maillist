That is an awfully US centric view. Just because there is no need for
IPv6 in the US at the moment doesn't mean it isn't needed elsewhere.
As you probably know, the IPv4 address space is very unevenly allocated,
with individual organizations like IBM, MIT and Ford (to name just a
few) hoarding complete 24-bit class A address blocks, while an entire
Asian or African *country* has to cope with much less.

Then there are the almost 3 billion (and counting) mobile phones we have
out there. Sooner or later they will be connected to the Internet. That
will be a real NAT nightmare to manage unless they change the protocol.
Besides the UMTS 3GPP along with the major phone manufacturers are
pushing for IPv6 very strongly.

The argument &quot;my ISP won't provide me with IPv6 so the protocol is
doomed&quot; just gives me the hives! Your comment was almost identical to
one made by a certain unnamed Linux maintainer who wasn't able to get
IPv6 to his Silicon Valley home a few years back.

I don't know how much you know about IPv6, but at least in this case not
really knowing anything about the protocol (or its mobility extension)
didn't stop him from making dismissive remarks about them. Let's just
say his opinion seems to have changed a bit since then ;-)

Seriously though, if you want to use IPv6, there are ways to do it even
though your ISP doesn't provide you direct access.

There is 6to4, which tunnels IPv6 packets over IPv4. The only
requirement is that you need a public IPv4 address.

See for example:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6to4">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6to4</A>
<A HREF="http://www.feyrer.de/NetBSD/6to4.html">http://www.feyrer.de/NetBSD/6to4.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/configuring-ipv6to4-tunnels.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/configuring-ipv6to4-tunnels.html</A>

At least on Gentoo this was absolutely trivial to set up and it just
plain *works*. Thanks for aggravating me; if I had known it takes just
two minutes to set up, I would have done it ages ago :-)

If you have a NAT:ed address you can in (some cases) use Teredo, which
tunnels the IPv6 packets over UDP.

See for example:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling</A>
<A HREF="http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/brokers/">http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/brokers/</A>
<A HREF="http://www.simphalempin.com/dev/miredo/">http://www.simphalempin.com/dev/miredo/</A>

I really don't know that much about Teredo, but with 6to4 you get an
entire 48-bit unique prefix to play around with, so you shouldn't be
running out of address space anytime soon :-)

As for no private address space, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by
it, but you have the whole fe80::/10 prefix of private non-routable
link-local communication.

If you want locally (but not globally) routable addresses, site-local
addresses have been deprecated but have been replaced by unique local
IPv6 unicast addresses.

&gt;<i> AFAIK, none of the developers have access to DGPS resources.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> have access to a source and sink of RTCM then we would certainly help
</I>&gt;<i> you get it working.
</I>
As I've mentioned, there are free Ntrip streams available at:
<A HREF="http://www.euref-ip.net/home">http://www.euref-ip.net/home</A>

If you can't find any suitable stream from euref-ip.net, there is no
harm in asking the other providers listed at:
<A HREF="http://igs.bkg.bund.de/root_ftp/NTRIP/streams/streamlist_world-wide.htm">http://igs.bkg.bund.de/root_ftp/NTRIP/streams/streamlist_world-wide.htm</A>

The contact information to the providers is at the bottom of the page.

I at least got access to a Finnish stream just by asking the Finnish
Geodetic Institute.

&gt;<i> Do you expect to get better than WAAS accuracy with your DGPS?  My
</I>&gt;<i> uneducated guess was that you need to postprocess DGPS to improve on
</I>&gt;<i> WAAS.
</I>
Living in Finland (about 60 degrees North), I can honestly say
visibility to geostationary satellites around the equator isn't that
good, therefore the SBAS (WAAS/EGNOS) correction data can instead be
converted to RTCM and streamed over the net. That's what I get through
my Ntrip stream, anyways.

Also, if you are within a 100 miles (or so) from a true DGPS (not to
mention RTK) reference station the correction data will typically be
significantly more accurate than with SBAS.

Ville
