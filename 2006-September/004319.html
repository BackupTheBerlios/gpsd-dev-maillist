Stop.  Do NOT put words in my mouth.  I NEVER said there is no need.
There is a need, although we can argue about why there is a need, where
there is a need and how urgent the need is. gpsd-dev is not the place.

&gt;<i> The argument &quot;my ISP won't provide me with IPv6 so the protocol is

</I>
Stop.  You intermingled two statements of mine in a manner I never
intended.  The fact that I can not get IPv6 space is what prevents me
from doing proper IPv6 testing.  It is NOT why I believe IPv6 will be a
total failure.  It is certainly an indicator of the failure of IPv6 to
deploy after all these years.

&gt;<i> I don't know how much you know about IPv6, but at least in this case not
</I>&gt;<i> really knowing anything about the protocol (or its mobility extension)
</I>&gt;<i> didn't stop him from making dismissive remarks about them. Let's just
</I>&gt;<i> say his opinion seems to have changed a bit since then ;-)
</I>
I know a lot about IPv6, at least on paper, and have discussed its
fate with many nanog and IETF members.  IPv6, by design, is in my mind
fatally flawed.  I could go on at length over why IPv6 has been a total
failure so far, and why IMHO it will be a failure in the future, but
this is not the forum for that.

&gt;<i> Seriously though, if you want to use IPv6, there are ways to do it even
</I>&gt;<i> though your ISP doesn't provide you direct access.
</I>
Been there, done that, wasted huge amounts of time.  I worked on this
very hard about 4 years ago.  All solutions I have tried have had severe
problems.  Yes I have tried 6to4 and have had a public IPv6 net from a
tunnel broker.

None of this is relevant to gpsd.  If you want to give this a shot, then
have at it.  Eric will be happy to take any working code for IPv6 into
gpsd.

&gt;<i> At least on Gentoo this was absolutely trivial to set up and it just
</I>&gt;<i> plain *works*. Thanks for aggravating me; if I had known it takes just
</I>&gt;<i> two minutes to set up, I would have done it ages ago :-)
</I>
I am just moving to Gentoo after almost 14 years on slackware.  If you can
point me to the proper packages/howtos I'll give it a shot.

&gt;<i> Living in Finland (about 60 degrees North), I can honestly say
</I>&gt;<i> visibility to geostationary satellites around the equator isn't that
</I>&gt;<i> good, therefore the SBAS (WAAS/EGNOS) correction data can instead be
</I>&gt;<i> converted to RTCM and streamed over the net. That's what I get through
</I>&gt;<i> my Ntrip stream, anyways.
</I>
Well have at it.  As Eric said, there is some RTCM, DGPSIP, and Ntrip
code in gpsd.  It is compiled in by default and there are no known bugs
with it.

Fewer and fewer GPS support RTCM anymore so the RTCM code in gpsd has
not had much use lately.  My old, now dead, Magellan EC-10X did RTCM.
My new Garmin GPS-18/LVC and GPS-18/USB do not.

What gps do you have connected to your gpsd.  Is it RTCM compatible?
Have you tried it yet with gpsd?

&gt;<i> Also, if you are within a 100 miles (or so) from a true DGPS (not to
</I>&gt;<i> mention RTK) reference station the correction data will typically be
</I>&gt;<i> significantly more accurate than with SBAS.
</I>
I would like to see how well we can make it work.
