<PRE>&gt;<i> Gentlemen,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> could you, please, check sirf.c file, I think that this code is not good:
</I>
While the problem may not be over there, you are right that there is an
issue with the indices of the arrays.  Some protocols clearly communicate
receiver channel numbers and those numbers are used as the index by their
driver, while other protocols just use opaque &quot;lists&quot; of satellites, with
a variable length, and no direct relation to the actual channel numbers in
the receiver.

Especially when all information isn't sent in a single packet, this
sometimes means the drivers have to make &quot;assumptions&quot; that may not be
valid all the time (e.g. not during startup), and combined with too
limited checking of data in clients this sometimes leads to segfaults.

You have compared the situation for sirf and nmea, but there is a similar
issue in the tsip driver.  Shortly after startup of gpsd, especially when
the receiver has been coldstarted as well, the xgps application sometimes
segfaults when connected to a Trimble receiver.
This is caused by the partial filling of the data arrays because tsip
sends all kinds of different messages each with part of the data, and the
client does not always understand that some fields can be valid and others
not.

Also, the indices in the arrays in gpsd are not the same for the two
arrays you are looking at: the satellite info is indexed by channel number
(if available, see above) and does not have to be contiguous, while the
&quot;satellites used&quot; array always has a packed list of satellite numbers.  So
you cannot index these arrays with the same variable and assume
corresponding values at the same places.
