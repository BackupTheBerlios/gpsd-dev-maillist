<PRE>More about the ntp-pps handling and time in general:

We have only a single TIME_SET flag that indicates that some form of TIME
has been retrieved from the message and stored.
The NMEA time handling in drivers.c (which I did not add) uses this
indicator to put the time field into the NTP shared memory structure.
Later, an extra check was made to ensure that only differing values are
put there, to avoid confusing ntpd with storing the same value several
times.

The problems with this approach are manyfold.
The timefield in NMEA messages usually is a &quot;time of fix&quot;, not the current
time.  There is an unknown amount of delay between the fix and the output
of the sentences.  This was compensated by adding-in an offset value,
empirically determined to be 675 ms.  However, this varies a lot between
receivers and thus causes system clock offsets, and PPS locking issues.

Most protocols provide separate messages that have the current time, as
opposed to the timestamp of the last computed fix.  However, this feature
was usually added only as an update in a later version of the protocol.
The SiRF driver, to which I added the ntp support myself, keeps an eye on
what kind of time messages it receives, and tries to use the ones that are
of better quality (but not always available).  With newer receivers it
will use the message 52/0x34 PPS time, which (when I understand the specs)
is trying to output a more accurate current time rather than a
time-of-fix.

I think the time handling for NMEA messages should be ripped out of
drivers.c and moved into nmea_parse.c, and handled in a way similar to
what is going on in the SiRF driver.  I.e. use ZDA time when that is
available, hopefully that corresponds better to real time (anyone knows if
the ZDA time is real time vs time of last fix?).

Separate from this, it would be good to decrease the auto-added offset
when this is warranted by the average offset exposed by currently used
receivers.  I cannot help with that, as I only have old stuff.
