So everyone likes rekafoobling the energymotron.... I mean,
reconfiguring the GPS?

No one has found themselves wondering why their receiver which was
doing exactly what was expected suddenly stopped? Yes, I do have a
couple of receivers that I don't mind having reset all the time, but
it'd be really nice to have gpsd not try make changes after I have
enabled the features I like. Or at least to have a way to tell gpsd
that this time, it's just going to have to deal with how I have my
receiver set up.

Also, a &quot;reverse proxy&quot; mode might be useful - like super-raw, but for
clients to write to the GPS. Sirfmon over the network can't work
properly without it, for example; it has a couple of commands which
probe the gps for the operating parameters of the navigation engine
and to fetch the NAV message. Alas, without a mode to write through to
the GPS, those won't work. Furthermore, one of the annoying
reconfigurations that gpsd does is to disable the NAV message. That
conflicts with sirfmon and it's ability to toggle the state of that
message.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
