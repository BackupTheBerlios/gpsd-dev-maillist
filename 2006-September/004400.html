Pretty much, but I wasn't sure if I should allow 3, or 8 or n
characters. Y'know... for parser simplicity.

</I>
I suppose we can do something like php's rtrim() first. basically
ensure the last nonblank character is ';'. I was going for parser
simplicity and easy format tests.

&gt;<i> Or how about just allow the ; anywhere in the buffer, then you can stack
</I>&gt;<i> more than one item on a line or in a buffer.

I thought about that too. Hence point 3. But the parser would be
simpler if we didn't have to cope with that. The protocol would be
more useful if we could.

&gt;<i> I prefer protocols I can fit on an editor.  Much easier to do
</I>&gt;<i> regressions and checks by hand.  I like what SMTP does in its headers,
</I>&gt;<i> lines less then 76 preferred and 256 max.
</I>
You mean you prefer protocols where you can fit the MTU into one
screenful, preferably one line? I was thinking the same. First I
though 80 characters, then I though maybe 256 if we're uploading an
hexdump of an ephemeris, and then I though I might want more. But I
wanted to go bounded. Either a one-time malloc buffer or a static
buffer. I'm tempted to allow 4K, because that's a modern memory page.

&gt;<i> One per line means you can easily parse lines with simple parsers.  But
</I>&gt;<i> the trend to the long line is already set in gpsd.  So I would allow
</I>&gt;<i> mix/match.
</I>
ie. you're voting for multiple commands per line. gpsd does indeed
support multiple commands in the single character command set. As this
is a new command protocol, I don't feel any pressing urge to do the
same thing. I was thinking about parser simplicity, and the extended
protocol is going to be complicated enough.

I think we should reserve commands of the form &quot;GPSD[A-Z]&quot; which map
to the version 3 single character commands. I guess that's another
argument in favor of stackable commands.

Thanks for your input!
