</I>
I'd like to see that be a runtime option. It doesn't break zero
adminstration because it defaults to the current behaviour, but it's
still packager friendly. Having to compile a special don't-reconfigure
version means I can't just add a prebuilt package, .rpm or .deb and
tell gpsd to not be clever and just pass me whatever the gps said.

Administration is when you have to keep going back to a program and
fiddling settings. One RTFM to figure out how to invoke it to meet
your needs is plenty acceptable.

I don't object to recompiles for my specialized embedded cases, but it
seems that two common use cases which should be supported in the
default build are &quot;i just wanna know where/when I am&quot; and &quot;tell me
exactly what the gps told you, and no funny stuff.&quot;

&gt;<i> I think this needs to be command-enabled.  Some of our embedded users
</I>&gt;<i> are actually going to care about the extra cycles processing the
</I>&gt;<i> tracker data eats.  And I think I remember that I disabled after
</I>&gt;<i> leap-second acquisition because it led rto trouble at low baud rates.
</I>
Ya figure? Look at byte 5 of the sirf message, if it's not a position
or time report, just skip it. No parsing required beyond that which
we'd have to do anyway. Embedded users: you can chime in any time
now...

Leap second acquisition would be troublesome at low baud rates, which
is why the manuals tend to indicate the use of 57600 for working with
the tracker data.

Also, gpsd sometime breaks when it en-/dis-ables the subframe data. My
receiver doesn't always reboot quickly enough, so gpsd thinks it has
lost connection to the device.

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe a protocol command to toggle the gps between maximum chattiness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and typical use? That'd require a lot more knowlege about all the NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variants though, and enabling the right magic. Much as I like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plaintext protocols like NMEA, I do kinda like the packed binary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages for efficiency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's use this as a good reason to think about the cleanest way to extend
</I>&gt;<i> the command set.  There are two issues:  what should the syntax of
</I>&gt;<i> extended commands be, and what levels of chattiness do we want?
</I>
Prior discussion on extending the command set.
<A HREF="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=115940558500017&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=115940558500017&amp;r=1&amp;w=2</A>

We're pretty much out of letters. I'm not sure we want to use numbers
as commands. That leaves a short list of symbols that would be
appropriate: @|%^+-/
'/' might not be bad - people are used to /command in instant
messaging programs.
'^' might work - the caret sort of suggests escalating or raising
'@' might work because one thinks of chat, and email and longer messages
'+' and '-' have been used as command line flag indicators as ages
'%' i'm neutral on that, except that it's used as a shell prompt character

'|' should be reserved for passthrough mode... pipe. it just feels right.

'$' is bad, because NMEA uses it for a sentence starter
'*' is bad because NMEA uses it to delimit the checksum
'=' is bad because we use that as an assignment operator
'#' is bad because we unix-heads think of it as a comment character

There's not much that protocol 3 doesn't give us for standard PVT
reports. Thus, I'm in favor of using an escape character like @ or ^
to signal that the following characters need to be fed to the extended
parser. Then we can have long command names and other goodness...

Turn on sirf message 7 unconditionally. Software solvers need it, and
for regular display, we get the week display wrong - toggles between
truncated and extended week number. Software version is small - but
it's nice, and not really needed for anything other than sirfmon.
Almanac and ephemeris are really only needed for those playing with
software solvers.

12/15 of my various version of SiRF manuals indicate that SiRFdemo
cranks the speed up to 57600 when raw tracker data is on. Some say
&quot;rate is set to 57600 automatically&quot; suggesting that this is something
the firmware rather than SiRFdemo does. That sounds like a strong
recommendation that we do the same. The uBlox variant says the rate is
cranked up to 38400.

If we have a &quot;toggle chattiness&quot; command, I'd vote for all-or-nothing.
If the usual PVT data isn't good enough for you, we won't presume to
know what you're doing, we'll just do our best to get everything the
gps can produce and pass it along, and hope you can process it all.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
