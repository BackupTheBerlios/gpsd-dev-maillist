<PRE>I have committed into SVN a version of the J-command patch that passes
regression tests as well as looking good on live data.

I found no fewer than three bugs in fix-data management while
debugging this code.  This didn't surprise me; I withdrew my own
previous patch and rejected Robin Darroch's because I had a suspicion
that these superficial approaches might be masking problems in the
data management.

Fortunately, none of these affected the computation or presentation of
basic nav data; they just messed up the computation of derived
quantities such as error estimates (and those mostly on NMEA rather
than single-packet devices).

The new code essentially redraws the boundary between the low-level
packet handling in libgpsd_core.c and the daemon logic in gpsd.c.
Fix merging and start-of-cycle clearing is all done in gpsd.c now.

Some cleanup will follow.  There is some now-unused storage in the
session structure that can be removed, also some dead code in 
libgpsd_core.c.  But what's in SVN now is ready for testing.

The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus by the Supreme
Being as his father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the
fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.
