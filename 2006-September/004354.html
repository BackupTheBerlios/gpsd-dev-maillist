<PRE>
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Agreed.  I also see anothre problem in the saniuty checks in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ntp-pps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; code that makes assumptions about the relationship between fix time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pps time.  After we get this I'll work on those.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope you don't mind that I mention that it was designed this way, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I prefer you to lay down and discuss the &quot;problems&quot; you find in it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over abusing your commit privileges and modifying the code to relax the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed checks (as you did before).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I only wanted to work on one problem at a time, but since you ae
</I>&gt;<i> in a hurry again lets do it.
</I>
I am not in a hurry, I only post this message because I hate to find yet
another &quot;fix&quot; from you introduced in a gpsd release version without
adequate discussion and testing by others.  And as Eric is in release mode
again, I need to be alert.


&gt;<i> This is community debugging.  You have had a long time to fix it and it
</I>&gt;<i> is still broken.
</I>
It is not broken.  You call it broken, but I think you are the only one
having problems.  At least, problems have not been reported here by
others.
I have tested the code on three different receivers, running three
different   protocols, and it worked on all of them.

&gt;&gt;<i> The code was written with the intention to first have the NTP daemon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the message-based time and be well within a second (I chose 400ms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I feel it should stay far away from possible plus-or-minus one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second confusion), and after that lock to the nearest second using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PPS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pulse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, see that is my problem.  The time from my PPS to my NMEA time
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be about 550mS (as gpsd computes it with the fudge factors).
</I>&gt;<i> That has been pretty rock solid for a long time.  So the +/- 400mS is
</I>&gt;<i> just plain wrong for my setup.
</I>
Then you can adjust the fudge to compensate.
As I wrote, the offset for NMEA is hard to get right because there are so
many different implementations for NMEA.
The offset should be settable inside gpsd but Eric does not want
configuration so it has to be solved elsewhere.


&gt;<i> PPS has no idea of WHAT second this is, so the worst damage it could do is
</I>&gt;<i> move things under the one second window fixed by the NMEA time.
</I>
No, the worst damage it can do is to lock plus or minus one second.
That is because the PPS monitor adds in the absolute time of the
systemclock with the relative time of the PPS pulses, and hands the result
to ntpd.
That is because I would not know how to hand over a PPS-specific offset
value to ntpd via the ntpshm mechanism.  ntpd has internal support for PPS
clocks that can do it, but no external interface for it AFAIK.

So, when there are no checks and the clock is more than 500ms off (as it
seems to be for you), and there are no other external references to
compare with, the system clock will happily lock off by one second,  That
is bad and must be avoided.

&gt;&gt;<i> There are hardcoded offsets from message time to real time in the code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am not too happy with that, because the offsets are not the same for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receiver.  But additional offset can be added in the ntp config file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fudge, when required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And as I recall that was an agreed solution, but I have not seen any
</I>&gt;<i> working
</I>&gt;<i> code from you.
</I>
What do you mean, code from me??
fudge is an ntpd option, a statement you put in your /etc/ntpd.conf
Amongst others, it allows you to specify the offset for each clock source,
which will be added in before applying it to the locking loop.
No code needed for that!

&gt;<i>  Talk is cheap, show us some code that fixes it your way
</I>&gt;<i> or let someone else fix it.  Leaving it broken is not an option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My solution would be to remove the fudge factors from gpsd and let the
</I>&gt;<i> tuning and sanity checking mostly be done by the ntpd code which is what
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> was designed to do.
</I>
That could be done, but it would mean that everyone has to use a fudge,
also those people that happen to have a receiver that falls within the
usual spectrum of offsets.
Maybe it is best to zero the offset for NMEA because it is so unreliable. 
But for other protocols, the hardwired offset seems to do a reasonable
job.


&gt;<i> If you have a solution then please commit some code.  Quickly.
</I>
You seem to be thinking that a solution implies that code is required, but
I disagree with that.

&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe there should be a survey to determine the optimal offset hardwired
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the code for every protocol supported (the median value for all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offsets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reported for different receivers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, right now the code adds 675mS and them I have to subtract back out
</I>&gt;<i> 550mS in ntp.  So the real delay is about 125mS.  The ntp offset for my
</I>&gt;<i> pps is .0003 mS.  Unless I set PUT_MAX_OFFSET to 600000 my pps is locked
</I>&gt;<i> out.  Notice how 550mS is not conveniently in +/- 400mS ?
</I>
Also notice that you only know it is 550 and not 450 because you compare
with other sources, and that zooming into the smallest offset (which would
happen when you increase the max_offset to 600 and not have other
references) woould lock it in off-by-1.

I think the PUT_MAX_OFFSET should be put back to 400 ms.
You can make your system operative by adding the proper fudge command in
/etc/ntpd.conf.

Someone with a large collection of NMEA receivers (or a poll on the user
list?) should find the typical offset found for NMEA, which may be
different from the 675ms I determined from my own receivers (that are old
and connected over slow 4800 bps serial).
The remainder of the offset can then by put in /etc/ntpd.conf

Still, no code required.
And I would not know how to solve it with code, other than adding some
configfile or option to set the offset for NMEA time on a case-by-case
basis.
Widening the tolerance range certainly is not an option for me.
