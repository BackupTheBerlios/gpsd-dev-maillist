Well, I only wanted to work on one problem at a time, but since you ae
in a hurry again lets do it.

This is community debugging.  You have had a long time to fix it and it
is still broken.

&gt;<i> The code was written with the intention to first have the NTP daemon lock
</I>&gt;<i> to the message-based time and be well within a second (I chose 400ms
</I>&gt;<i> because I feel it should stay far away from possible plus-or-minus one
</I>&gt;<i> second confusion), and after that lock to the nearest second using the PPS
</I>&gt;<i> pulse.
</I>
Well, see that is my problem.  The time from my PPS to my NMEA time
seems to be about 550mS (as gpsd computes it with the fudge factors).
That has been pretty rock solid for a long time.  So the +/- 400mS is
just plain wrong for my setup.

&gt;<i> When you allow NTP to lock onto PPS and at the same time allow the
</I>&gt;<i> message-based time to be 800ms off (for example), it is very likely that
</I>&gt;<i> the system clock locks off-by-one-second.
</I>
I do not see how this can be so.  I have my NMEA time set to a few mS.
and it is in total agreement with my other chimers.  When my pps gets more
than 10mS out my ntp throws it away.  Yet your sanity check throws away
my good data.  My trust in the ntp sanity checks is borne out by my
real world experience.  Conversely the existing checks have been proven,
in my case, to be flat wrong.

PPS has no idea of WHAT second this is, so the worst damage it could do is
move things under the one second window fixed by the NMEA time.

&gt;<i> There are hardcoded offsets from message time to real time in the code.  I
</I>&gt;<i> am not too happy with that, because the offsets are not the same for every
</I>&gt;<i> receiver.  But additional offset can be added in the ntp config file using
</I>&gt;<i> fudge, when required.
</I>
And as I recall that was an agreed solution, but I have not seen any working
code from you.  Talk is cheap, show us some code that fixes it your way
or let someone else fix it.  Leaving it broken is not an option.

My solution would be to remove the fudge factors from gpsd and let the
tuning and sanity checking mostly be done by the ntpd code which is what it
was designed to do.

If you have a solution then please commit some code.  Quickly.

&gt;<i> Maybe there should be a survey to determine the optimal offset hardwired
</I>&gt;<i> in the code for every protocol supported (the median value for all offsets
</I>&gt;<i> reported for different receivers).
</I>
Well, right now the code adds 675mS and them I have to subtract back out
550mS in ntp.  So the real delay is about 125mS.  The ntp offset for my
pps is .0003 mS.  Unless I set PUT_MAX_OFFSET to 600000 my pps is locked
out.  Notice how 550mS is not conveniently in +/- 400mS ?
