You are absolutely right :-)

</I>
Sorry, I just have bad memories about comments just like that (meaning
just that ;-)

</I>
If you have the the time (and energy) to discuss the subject yet another
time, I'd be interested to hear your points off the list. I've been
working with IPv6 and Mobile IPv6 for several years now, so perhaps I've
developed tunnel vision about the subject, but I see IPv6 doing so many
things superior to IPv4.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Seriously though, if you want to use IPv6, there are ways to do it even
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> though your ISP doesn't provide you direct access.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Been there, done that, wasted huge amounts of time.  I worked on this
</I>&gt;<i> very hard about 4 years ago.  All solutions I have tried have had severe
</I>&gt;<i> problems.  Yes I have tried 6to4 and have had a public IPv6 net from a
</I>&gt;<i> tunnel broker.
</I>
That's a shame to hear. As I said, I haven't really had any need for
IPv6 tunneling previously, but for me at least 6to4 works like a charm
as there no longer is any need for any manual configuration.

&gt;<i> None of this is relevant to gpsd.  If you want to give this a shot, then
</I>&gt;<i> have at it.  Eric will be happy to take any working code for IPv6 into
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.
</I>
If Neal hasn't done it by then, I might have time to look at this at
some later point this fall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> At least on Gentoo this was absolutely trivial to set up and it just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> plain *works*. Thanks for aggravating me; if I had known it takes just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> two minutes to set up, I would have done it ages ago :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am just moving to Gentoo after almost 14 years on slackware.  If you can
</I>&gt;<i> point me to the proper packages/howtos I'll give it a shot.
</I>
The Gentoo Handbook is a good place to start :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Living in Finland (about 60 degrees North), I can honestly say
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> visibility to geostationary satellites around the equator isn't that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> good, therefore the SBAS (WAAS/EGNOS) correction data can instead be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> converted to RTCM and streamed over the net. That's what I get through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my Ntrip stream, anyways.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well have at it.  As Eric said, there is some RTCM, DGPSIP, and Ntrip
</I>&gt;<i> code in gpsd.  It is compiled in by default and there are no known bugs
</I>&gt;<i> with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fewer and fewer GPS support RTCM anymore so the RTCM code in gpsd has
</I>&gt;<i> not had much use lately.  My old, now dead, Magellan EC-10X did RTCM.
</I>&gt;<i> My new Garmin GPS-18/LVC and GPS-18/USB do not.
</I>
Yes I know, and it's a shame.

&gt;<i> What gps do you have connected to your gpsd.  Is it RTCM compatible?
</I>&gt;<i> Have you tried it yet with gpsd?
</I>
I have a Nokia LD-1W, a SirfStarIIe/LP based bludetooth GPS unit. In
theory it should support DGPS, but in practice it doesn't seem to. At
least it seems to totally ignore the RTCM data I'm sending to it. Of
course I've set the DGPS source to the external RTCM source in stead of
SBAS, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.  might be wrong, but
it seems that the DGPS corrections have to come in through the second
serial port, which apparently isn't connected on my GPS receiver.

After I spent time implementing the Ntrip support for gpsd, I can tell
you it was quite a disappointment to notice it had all been in vain.

I've now bitten the bullet and started working on doing the position
calculations inside gpsd. I'm just going to read the raw pseudorange
measurements,clock corrections and IS-GPS-200 navigation messages from
the GPS receiver and do everything else in the daemon. This way I at
least can apply the correction data to the measurements and hopefully
get the accurate position estimates I need for my master's thesis project.

If there is interest for this feature, I can probably post some code in
a week or two.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, if you are within a 100 miles (or so) from a true DGPS (not to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mention RTK) reference station the correction data will typically be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> significantly more accurate than with SBAS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to see how well we can make it work.
</I>
It's certainly my hope and intention to get the DGPS code working some
way or another.

Regards,
Ville
