<PRE>FYI - I didn't get much notice or feedback.

Begin forwarded message:

&gt;<i> From: Frank Nicholas &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">frank at nicholasfamilycentral.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Date: June 14, 2006 8:08:02 PM EDT
</I>&gt;<i> To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd-dev at berlios.de</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Last 2 or 3 versions of gpsd, NMEA mode don't work well  
</I>&gt;<i> for Kismac, cgps or xgps
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using a GlobalSat BT-318, Bluetooth GPS.  I reported on it in  
</I>&gt;<i> Vol 1, #180, 4/8/05, of the Dev List.
</I>&gt;<i> Mfr's. Site:  <A HREF="http://www.globalsat.com.tw/english/">http://www.globalsat.com.tw/english/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> products_detail.php?main_id=21&amp;p_id=107
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a Sirf II receiver, that defaults to NMEA.  gpsd has NEVER  
</I>&gt;<i> been able to detect or switch it to Sirf II, even-though the Palm &amp;  
</I>&gt;<i> Windows utilities are able to.  gpsd always detects it as a NMEA  
</I>&gt;<i> receiver.  First, if there's anything I can do to help that change,  
</I>&gt;<i> PLEASE let me know.  I'm willing to even loan it out, if need be,  
</I>&gt;<i> for testing, etc.  I think I would have better results with it in  
</I>&gt;<i> Sirf mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kismac (an open source Mac Wardriving application) often reports no  
</I>&gt;<i> fix, or incorrect data (typically 1-2 seconds behind).  I don't  
</I>&gt;<i> know what commands it is using to get data from gpsd, but am wiling  
</I>&gt;<i> to look at the source code, if need be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'cgps' &amp; 'xgps' are not consistent between the two.  cgps flashes a  
</I>&gt;<i> fix &amp; location once per second, then no fix or location, until the  
</I>&gt;<i> next second.  It was tough to catch the fix for the screenshot.   
</I>&gt;<i> xgps has a constant location &amp; NO fix, but flashes 3D Fix &amp; no  
</I>&gt;<i> location, once per second.  I have screenshots of this, linked  
</I>&gt;<i> below.  I would have expected cgps &amp; xgps to produce the same  
</I>&gt;<i> results....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've tested with a Mac tool called GPSUtility that talks to the  
</I>&gt;<i> receiver in NMEA.  It has a constant location &amp; fix.  It also has  
</I>&gt;<i> an output window, showing what it's receiving from the receiver.   
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the output from the receiver is probably set to what gpsd  
</I>&gt;<i> configured.  gpsd had been run, and I'm assuming it set what  
</I>&gt;<i> statements/info the GPS would spit out in NMEA mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've included links to screenshots of cgps, xgps &amp; GPSUtility.   
</I>&gt;<i> I've also included the text output of gpsd &amp; GPSUtility, when  
</I>&gt;<i> running.  The GPS is stationary on a window sill, during these tests.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm able to easily build the released tarballs.  I can checkout  
</I>&gt;<i> SVN, but the autogen.sh script doesn't work for me (build  
</I>&gt;<i> environment issues).  I'm willing to run whatever tests or logs  
</I>&gt;<i> that will help in resolving this.  I'm also willing to patch the  
</I>&gt;<i> release tarballs, to try updates in SVN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, I'd like for gpsd to change it to Sirf mode, even if I  
</I>&gt;<i> have to pass a command to gpsd to make that happen.  This happening  
</I>&gt;<i> automatically would be GREAT.  Before that happens, there appears  
</I>&gt;<i> to be something wrong with either what the GPS is giving gpsd, in  
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA mode, or the way gpsd is interpreting the NMEA received from  
</I>&gt;<i> the GPS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW - The GPS retains mode (NMEA/Sirf), as long as it has power.   
</I>&gt;<i> It's normal installation is in a vehicle, and it only has power  
</I>&gt;<i> when I flip a power switch.  The mode will default back to NMEA,  
</I>&gt;<i> without power for a few minutes.  I don't recall if I've set the  
</I>&gt;<i> GPS to Sirf, and then tried to use it with gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for taking the time to read through this.  Let me know what  
</I>&gt;<i> I can do!
</I>&gt;<i>
