&gt;&gt;<i> I think the time handling for NMEA messages should be ripped out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drivers.c and moved into nmea_parse.c, and handled in a way similar to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what is going on in the SiRF driver.  I.e. use ZDA time when that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available, hopefully that corresponds better to real time (anyone knows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the ZDA time is real time vs time of last fix?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long term, I would love to see how you this gets coded.
</I>
I am not going to write code that I cannot test myself.  I know all too
well that this will lead to errors.

However, I invite you to look at the sirf.c driver and the mechanism it
uses to select the time source.
Delete the #ifdef NTPSHM_ENABLE section from drivers.c and introduce some
of them to nmea_parse.c, in those handlers that retrieve a time from the
message.
Use a driver-private-storage member (called time_seen in sirf.c) that
holds a bit pattern with each bit corresponding with a certain message
type, and the more significant bit corresponding with more reliable time
source.
(e.g. a message claiming to hold current UTC time would be more reliable
than a message giving the timestamp for the fix data in that message)

Then, using the IS_HIGHEST_BIT macro, put the data in the ntp shm segment
only when the actual received message is the best available source
(because no better messages have been seen from the receiver before).
This is done using:

#define TIME_SEEN_x   0x04 (for example)

session-&gt;driver.name.time_seen |= TIME_SEEN_x;
if (IS_HIGHEST_BIT(session-&gt;driver.sirf.time_seen,TIME_SEEN_x))
    (void)ntpshm_put(session, time + offset);

This way, you can have different offsets for different message types, to
compensate for the different types of time appearing in there.
And by assuring that you keep looking only at one type of message (after
things have settled), you probably avoid strange types of jitter.

However, because so many aspects of time in NMEA messages are undefined,
it will probably still be difficult to keep different receivers in a
locking window.
And that is required (forgot this in my previous reply), because you
cannot read back the fudge that ntpd is using, and if ntpd is locked to
the GPS and how far the system time is off from it.  The ntpd shared
memory is a one-way communication channel, unfortunately.
