<PRE>Any one understand why our list server denies search engines from
indexing it (see <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/robots.txt">https://lists.berlios.de/robots.txt</A>).  

As, I'm now experiencing the 8 to 10-second delay issue in my GPS
receiver and I wanted to search if there was any resolution from the
person who had a similar issue a few months back.  

Issue is BU-303 in SiRF mode runs 8-10 seconds behind real time with
both GPSD and sirfmon.  In NMEA mode, it's too close real time to
determine any delay.  But, in SiRF at highway speeds it's off the
length of a football field.  Very funny coming to a stop and the
velocity readings slow down to 0 about 8-10 seconds later.  

And since gpsd prefers SiRF over NMEA, I have to stop the daemon run
sirfmon press &quot;n&quot; and start the daemon again after a reboot.

Our good friends at usglobalsat said &quot;the SiRF protocol processess
[sic] a greater amount of data causing some applications to display a
delay.&quot;  What a crock!  I can only assume that my request wasn't clear.
 I assume there's some kind of &quot;smoothing function&quot; that's accidentally
been turned on in SiRF mode or maybe I have a bad firmware.  Anyway,
can anyone suggest a good USB mouse GPS receiver that's not made by
usglobalsat?
Thanks,
Mike (mrdvt92)
