Check the archives.  Like today for instance.  I always assume that if
two people report a problem then 20 must have the problem.  And the
Garmin is not exactly a rare beast either.

&gt;<i> Then you can adjust the fudge to compensate.
</I>
As I do, but that requires a recompile of drivers.c and that is a pain.

</I>&gt;<i> The offset should be settable inside gpsd but Eric does not want
</I>&gt;<i> configuration so it has to be solved elsewhere.
</I>
So, do we agree here?  Can I remove the gpsd fudge once and for all?
ntpd already has a config file with its own fidge to do this and
applying a second fudge seems pointless to me.

&gt;<i> &gt; PPS has no idea of WHAT second this is, so the worst damage it could do is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; move things under the one second window fixed by the NMEA time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the worst damage it can do is to lock plus or minus one second.
</I>&gt;<i> That is because the PPS monitor adds in the absolute time of the
</I>&gt;<i> systemclock with the relative time of the PPS pulses, and hands the result
</I>&gt;<i> to ntpd.
</I>
And that is why, at least until the system is calibrated, that ntpd should
always be run with multiple chimers.  That is ntpd best practice already,
so problem solved.  Once the proper fudges are applied in ntp.conf this
is not an issue.

&gt;<i> So, when there are no checks and the clock is more than 500ms off (as it
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be for you),
</I>
Mine is only 125mS off.  The fudge in the gpsd code is the one that assumes
675mS off!   Remove the 675mS fudge in the gpsd code and my 125mS looks
very good.  It even passes your +/- 400mS test nicely.

&gt;<i> and there are no other external references to
</I>&gt;<i> compare with, the system clock will happily lock off by one second,  That
</I>&gt;<i> is bad and must be avoided.
</I>
Here we agree and disagree.  We both agree it must be avoided.  We both
agree that with the proper fudge(2) this is easily avoided.  It is using a
single number, buried in gpsd. to represent all GPS/PPS fudges that I do
not agree with.

&gt;<i> What do you mean, code from me??
</I>
Well you certainly seem to defend it.  So at least for the point of this
discussion it is &quot;your code&quot;.

&gt;<i> fudge is an ntpd option, a statement you put in your /etc/ntpd.conf
</I>
Agreed  It is also in the gpsd code here:

drivers.c, line 83:

             /* this magic number is derived from observation */
             (void)ntpshm_put(session, session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.time + 0.675);

The fudge in gpsd and the fudge in ntpd are added.

&gt;<i> No code needed for that!
</I>
OK, split the hair, no new code, just a bit of old code removed.

So can we agree this code (&quot;+ 0.675&quot;) can be removed?  That also solves
my problem.

&gt;<i> That could be done, but it would mean that everyone has to use a fudge,
</I>
As the code shows above, everyone already does use a fudge, a bad one
for many.

&gt;<i> Maybe it is best to zero the offset for NMEA because it is so unreliable.
</I>
So, we are agreed?  I can remove the code above?  With that I can also
use a +/-400mS window.

&gt;<i> But for other protocols, the hardwired offset seems to do a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> job.
</I>
Speak for yourself.  That is not the case for me on Garmin GPS-18/LVC
(NMEA).  Garmin binary has no PPS and can work well with just the one
fudge in ntpd.  Fix others as you see fit.

&gt;<i> &gt; If you have a solution then please commit some code.  Quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You seem to be thinking that a solution implies that code is required, but
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree with that.
</I>
Do we agree on the code removal?

&gt;<i> I think the PUT_MAX_OFFSET should be put back to 400 ms.
</I>&gt;<i> You can make your system operative by adding the proper fudge command in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/ntpd.conf.
</I>
Been there, done that, does not work.  No reasoning involved, simple
testing has proven this.

&gt;<i> Someone with a large collection of NMEA receivers (or a poll on the user
</I>&gt;<i> list?) should find the typical offset found for NMEA, which may be
</I>&gt;<i> different from the 675ms I determined from my own receivers (that are old
</I>&gt;<i> and connected over slow 4800 bps serial).
</I>
I suspect the problem is far more related to the speed of your serial
connection than to the GPS involved.  I run my GPS-18/LVC ar 19200 to
reduce latency and jitter in the time of the NMEA.  Some GPS run at
57600 or even higher speeds.  Expecting one fudge to work over such a
range of serials speeds is not realistic.

&gt;<i> The remainder of the offset can then by put in /etc/ntpd.conf
</I>
Here we agree.

&gt;<i> Still, no code required.
</I>
Here we do not.  See above.
