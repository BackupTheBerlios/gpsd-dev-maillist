&gt;<i> What's the status of IPv6 support in gpsd?

None.  My personal opinion is that IPv6 will be as successfull as OSI was.
For the younger folks here, that is wildly praised, widely studied, and
totally ignored in real world deploymenta.  I would love to be proven
wrong, but IMHO IPv6 has serious fatal flaws.

There is NO private IP space in IPv6 and all three of my upstream
ISPs have refused to implement IPv6 so can not allocate me any IPv6
addresses.  I ask every year, but the answer is still the same: NO.

That said, no reason not to implement it in gpsd if you need it.  Just
no one has asked yet.

&gt;<i> As well as RTCM104_SERVICE where RTCM data from a DGPS device is available

</I>
Lot's of smoke here, no fire.  I'd sure like to see something like this
work.

&gt;<i> This is for highly mobile automotive or robotics applications based on Linux
</I>&gt;<i> over WiFi using DSRC (check Wikipedia) or MobileIP, both of which use IPv6.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm willing to work on these things if the features are not available.

AFAIK, none of the developers have access to DGPS resources.  If you
have access to a source and sink of RTCM then we would certainly help
you get it working.

Do you expect to get better than WAAS accuracy with your DGPS?  My
uneducated guess was that you need to postprocess DGPS to improve on
WAAS.
