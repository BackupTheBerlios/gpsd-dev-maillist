&quot;post 2.34&quot;? ;)

Heck yeah. Having heard some of your views on ipv6, I figure we need
to get started with designing sooner rather than later, and we need to
be smart about it.

&gt;<i> When I did parsers in assembly I would care about this.  Not now.

</I>
Sounds like you have more experience than I do at maintaining
shortest-match parsers - you're saying this is is not a long-term
maintenance headache, keeping a shortest-match parser up to date?

&gt;<i> You just know someone will grab this data with a CR/LF instead of a
</I>&gt;<i> LF then wonder why things are broken.
</I>
rtrim() it is.

&gt;<i> Of course all this would be trivial with a few REGEXP, but I am sure the
</I>&gt;<i> embedded folks would kill us if we did that. :-)
</I>
heh. i should benchmark that.

&gt;<i> Just use a strchr() in a while() loop  to chop the string at each ';'.
</I>
yup.

&gt;<i> I can see the empheris issue.  So I could go with &lt;76 bytes long
</I>&gt;<i> preferred and &lt;4096 mandatory.
</I>
Yeah, I'm so not typing in a 4K command. Really, that's there to allow
for crazy things like firmware updates, ephemeris loads, debugging
messages, hooks for doing software gps inside gpsd, other stuff i
can't think of right now... and it's partly &quot;why not?&quot; we're going to
get a whole page anyway, so let's use it.

&gt;<i> I much prefer one command per line.  Much easier to debug.  But eric
</I>&gt;<i> has been moving the other way.  If we allow commands to stack on ';',
</I>&gt;<i> like in SQL, then each person can do it his way.
</I>
In a way, I think i'd prefer to see one command per line. Period. This
extension protocol is to cope with esoteric, experimental things that
the v3 protocol can't. I'm asking a serious question here, to all you
gpsd users and developers: &quot;how does the current gpsd protocol fail to
meet your needs?&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; I think we should reserve commands of the form &quot;GPSD[A-Z]&quot; which map
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the version 3 single character commands. I guess that's another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; argument in favor of stackable commands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like that.  That would be a nice gesture to allow quick upgrading of
</I>&gt;<i> clients while opening the door to major updates as well.
</I>
I'm not advocating killing off v3... for what it is, I like it. Just
about everything I need, I get from 'O'. Put that in your pipe and
smoke it, NMEA!

I'm just kinda thinking aloud. Do we rename all the commands
internally, and when we get a short command ('O'), call the long
handler ('@GPSDO') but set a compatibility output flag? Do it the
other way around?

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
