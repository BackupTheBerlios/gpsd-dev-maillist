&gt;&gt;<i> It is not broken.  You call it broken, but I think you are the only one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having problems.  At least, problems have not been reported here by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Check the archives.  Like today for instance.  I always assume that if
</I>&gt;<i> two people report a problem then 20 must have the problem.  And the
</I>&gt;<i> Garmin is not exactly a rare beast either.
</I>
I don't see any messages reporting problems here.  Where are they?

&gt;&gt;<i> Then you can adjust the fudge to compensate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I do, but that requires a recompile of drivers.c and that is a pain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I wrote, the offset for NMEA is hard to get right because there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many different implementations for NMEA.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The offset should be settable inside gpsd but Eric does not want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration so it has to be solved elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, do we agree here?  Can I remove the gpsd fudge once and for all?
</I>&gt;<i> ntpd already has a config file with its own fidge to do this and
</I>&gt;<i> applying a second fudge seems pointless to me.
</I>
It is required to get within the sync window.  When you remove it
entirely, others will get problems.  It would be better to lower it by so
much that you get correct lock and still give users with other, slower,
receivers a chance.

&gt;<i> at least until the system is calibrated, that ntpd should
</I>&gt;<i> always be run with multiple chimers.  That is ntpd best practice already,
</I>&gt;<i> so problem solved.  Once the proper fudges are applied in ntp.conf this
</I>&gt;<i> is not an issue.
</I>
I would not assume that everyone has suitable internet connectivity on
their system.  Especially because one of the reasons for having a local
time receiver is to cover the case of no internet connectivity.


&gt;<i> Mine is only 125mS off.  The fudge in the gpsd code is the one that
</I>&gt;<i> assumes
</I>&gt;<i> 675mS off!   Remove the 675mS fudge in the gpsd code and my 125mS looks
</I>&gt;<i> very good.  It even passes your +/- 400mS test nicely.
</I>
You keep assuring that 125ms offset is the norm, without providing any
evidence.  All my testing always yielded in excess of 500ms offset.
It looks like you are after solving your own problem, but do not care
about other situations.


&gt;&gt;<i> What do you mean, code from me??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well you certainly seem to defend it.  So at least for the point of this
</I>&gt;<i> discussion it is &quot;your code&quot;.
</I>
The issue is not whether I wrote some code, but if new code is required to
solve problems.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fudge is an ntpd option, a statement you put in your /etc/ntpd.conf
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed  It is also in the gpsd code here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> drivers.c, line 83:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>              /* this magic number is derived from observation */
</I>&gt;<i>              (void)ntpshm_put(session, session-&gt;gpsdata.fix.time + 0.675);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fudge in gpsd and the fudge in ntpd are added.
</I>
So the suggestion is to adjust the one in ntpd.
But when the difference added in ntpd is more than the allowed offset in
the pps monitor, there will be no pps lock.  This is apparently the case
with your receiver.  You can solve that by lowering the 0.675 to e.g.
0.500.
Setting it to zero will work in this case, but will cause problems for those
that need more offset in that place.

As I have said before, NMEA is unsuitable for time sync.  But people keep
trying.

The binary protocols have better defined messages and/or provide more
predictable latency because the protocol is linked to a particular
implementation.
