Yeah yeah ...

That tone of disgust you hear is the fact that I went through SVN this
weekend and found out that this has been broken in some state or other
since r2648. I guess you could say the bug is closer to being found,
now we just need to figure out WTF to do about it.

GPSD tries reconfigure a gps to the most useful protocol - usually
that's the vendor binary. Alas this reconfiguration can be somewhat
problematic with bluetooth receivers which is too bad, because most of
the vendor protocols can transmit a complete navigation solution in
one message.

I know in my earlier gps-hacking experiments I ran into a lot of
trouble with flow control.

I'm a little short on ideas at the moment, partly because I haven't
had coffee yet today, and partly because I don't have any bluetooth.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
