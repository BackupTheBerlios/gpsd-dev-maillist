<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So, do we agree here?  Can I remove the gpsd fudge once and for all?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ntpd already has a config file with its own fidge to do this and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; applying a second fudge seems pointless to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is required to get within the sync window.  When you remove it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entirely, others will get problems.  It would be better to lower it by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much that you get correct lock and still give users with other, slower,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receivers a chance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, then how about we split the difference.  Your ideal is 0.675, mine is
</I>&gt;<i> 0.125.  So how about 0.400?    Although with a 500mS lock range that
</I>&gt;<i> only gives me 0.225 of pull in which is a bit on the edge.
</I>
Ok let's try with 0.400 and see if there are any users that drop off at
the other end (because their offset is much more than 0.675)
Hopefully not.

&gt;&gt;<i> You keep assuring that 125ms offset is the norm, without providing any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evidence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Never.  I have said that MY system is solid at 0.125.  Feedback from
</I>&gt;<i> other users of GPS-18/LVC have reported similar values.
</I>
Yes, but other receivers (I see one on the list right now) have
considerably higher offsets.

&gt;<i> I would rather remove the assumption of 0.125, 0.675, or any other value
</I>&gt;<i> from the code.  You want to keep assumptions in the code.
</I>
No.  I would want to put them in a configfile.  But as I have explained,
Eric does not want that.  So that is why I put them in the code.  I don't
want that, nor do I think it is a good solution.


&gt;<i> Sure I can solve it for me.  We are trying to get a way that works for
</I>&gt;<i> everyone.  2 other GPS-18/LVC users in the last week.
</I>
I would rather count &quot;GPS-18/LVC&quot; as one case, and all the other NMEA
receivers each as other cases.  Of course, when many users of the same
receiver use the same code, they might get the same results.  But what
about users of other receivers?


&gt;<i> And .500 will not work for me.  That only give me a .025 lock range!
</I>&gt;<i> (0.500 - 0.400 = 0.100 lock edge, and ideally I am at 0.125, so a 0.025
</I>&gt;<i> lock range).
</I>
Even with a 25ms range there should be no problem, as ntpd will keep the
time well within such a tolerance.  Only when your receiver sometimes has
100ms offset, it will go out of range.  But that would only confirm my
standpoint that NMEA messages are not really suitable for time sync, as
their offset from the real time is too variable.


&gt;&gt;<i> As I have said before, NMEA is unsuitable for time sync.  But people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You dispute my 0.019ppm?
</I>
0.019 ms you mean?
No way you are getting that with NMEA!
You are using PPS pulses, that is an entirely different mechanism running
in parallel with the clunky NMEA method that we have difficulty getting
within 500 ms for everybody...
