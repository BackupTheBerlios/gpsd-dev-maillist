Ask berlios.

&gt;<i> As, I'm now experiencing the 8 to 10-second delay issue in my GPS

Not that I've seen

&gt;<i> Issue is BU-303 in SiRF mode runs 8-10 seconds behind real time with

</I>
Hm. that's odd. If it was just the time that was off (and by
13-15sec), I'd chalk it up to the GPS-UTC leap seconds. But if you're
saying there's some actual serious 10-second delay between the time
the receiver moves and the time GPSD sees that move, there's a
problem.

I say 13-15s because there is about a 1s latency for gpsd to have its
way with your data. and we're currently at 14 leap seconds, and local
clocks are involved too.

My attached screenshot shows a delay in time (i don't think we're
handling leap seconds properly in sirfmon) and a pretty decent match
for the rest of the navigation data. Don't take that to mean I don't
believe you - i'm just going to have to go for a datalogging drive
sometime.

&gt;<i> Our good friends at usglobalsat
</I>
don't say that while i'm drinking coffee!

&gt;<i> said &quot;the SiRF protocol processess
</I>&gt;<i> [sic] a greater amount of data causing some applications to display a
</I>&gt;<i> delay.&quot;  What a crock!  I can only assume that my request wasn't clear.
</I>&gt;<i> I assume there's some kind of &quot;smoothing function&quot; that's accidentally
</I>&gt;<i> been turned on in SiRF mode or maybe I have a bad firmware.  Anyway,
</I>
Yes, there is a smoothing function called static navigation. It may be
biting you.

&gt;<i> can anyone suggest a good USB mouse GPS receiver that's not made by
</I>&gt;<i> usglobalsat?
</I>
good luck. It seems like most usb mouse receivers use a globalsat OEM module.
