I don't see anywhere, that RTCM data has to be sent only as complete
packets. This is streamed and can arrive in chunks. So if the same
buffer is used for multiple devices you may get broken data.

dev1 sends: 1 2 3 4 5
dev2 sends: A B C D E

rtcm_buf contains: 1 2 A B C 3 ..

I think the point is clear here.

</I>
Sorry. Of course I meant netgnss_report().

The Problem is, that netgnss_report calls ntrip_report *only* if the
device is an ntrip device. netgnss_report is only called, if the device
has a 3D fix. An ntrip device, which read RTCM data, cannot have any
fix. So ntrip_report() is never called.

It wouldn't make sense like it is now anyway, because it would try to
generate an NMEA sentence from the Fix in the RTCM(NTRIP session, which
don't have a fix.

A connection between some other GPS device and the NTRIP/RTCM device is
needed to deliver NMEA reports back to the ntrip server.

See my other mail from a few minutes ago for more details on this.
