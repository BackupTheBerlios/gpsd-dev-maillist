<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Thats good. I hope there are not more of these parts, where NTRIP needs a
</I>&gt;<i> special treatment. At least it now works for you and me.
</I>
Alas, the drama may not quite be over.

I looked at the guard patch.  It would have worked as written, but it smelled
bad to me.  The stink arose from the fact that there isn't any obvious 
relationship between a GNSS service type in the global context and whether
an individual, local sensor, should be probed.

So I started digging.

I quickly found a better point patch for that guard, using the is_serial 
member of the device structure.  But in the process I unearthed a far more
noxious stench.

I hadn't really looked at the global context members related to
DGPS/NTRIP in a long time.  The code implementing those features came in 
from third parties, seemed to work, and wasn't intrusive, so I merged it 
without thinking much about it.

Turns out those global context members reflected a baked-in assumption
that gpsd would only ever be connected to one DGPS service at a time.
They might even have predated my rewrite to support multiple
sensors. In the architecture we have now, after that rewrite, this is
a pretty serious orthogonality violation. Thus the stench.

All that global context state needed to become per-device state. I've
done that, now, but it did require significant core code changes.
We're therefore back to prerelease state Blue (1).  I have a bit more
cleanup to do before asking Gary to re-test on the Garmins.

Andre, please pull head and test.  It'd be nice to know I haven't
broken the NTRIP support.
