<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Turns out those global context members reflected a baked-in assumption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that gpsd would only ever be connected to one DGPS service at a time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was aware of that assumption (I thought the dsock was a dead giveaway).
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think its necessarily bad, because I doubt the ability of many
</I>&gt;<i> GPS devices to be able to work with different streams of correction data.
</I>
Who says the only use for RTCM data is correcting GPSes?  I know of at least
one other; atmospheric physicists can use a network of RTCM stations as an
ionosphere observatory.  This might actually matter in a practical way to,
say, people doing risk assessments on solar coronal mass ejections like
the big class X we had last week.

Maybe this seems like a marginal use case to you, but it illustrates an
important point about a tool like gpsd.  Limiting assumptions about use cases
should *not* be baked into low levels of the tool.  Better to make it as 
flexible as possible and let users implement policy in their clients.

&gt;<i> It definitely needs some catching and erroring out if someone wants to
</I>&gt;<i> provide more than one of those.
</I>
I suppose I should make the RTCM buffer per-device.  Other than that 
I don't see a problem.

&gt;<i> See my other mail for a patch, that make the ntrip connection part work again.
</I>
Applied and pushed.
 
&gt;<i> Another thing that I just confirmed is that ntrip_report() is no longer called.
</I>&gt;<i> This is crucial to keep the connection alive. The server may determine what
</I>&gt;<i> data to send depending on the current position of the client. So the NTRIP
</I>&gt;<i> server needs a position from the client to work properly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that net_gnss_dispatch is now only called for devices, that have a
</I>&gt;<i> 3D Fix, which is really not possible for an RTCM device.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This worked before exactly because of the dsock member, which was used just
</I>&gt;<i> for that kind of stuff.
</I>
I think this can easily be fixed.  Give me an hour or two.
