</I>&gt;<i> It copies from a global, shared RTCM buffer to the device.  I'll
</I>&gt;<i> describe how this buffer is updated in a bit.
</I>
The code currently checks for both RTCM2_IS and RTCM3_is. I am very
skeptical as to the ability of GPS devices to mix these things.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The NTRIP server needs an NMEA update from one active GPS device. I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really dislike mixing updates from different devices, even if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference between the data is marginal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One assumption that the code does presently make is that all GPses
</I>&gt;<i> attached to the daemon are near each other from the point of view of
</I>&gt;<i> an RTCM station many kilometers distant.  This assumption seems safe
</I>&gt;<i> because the maximum cable traverse for RS-232, USB and Bluetooth
</I>&gt;<i> connections is measured in meters rather than kilometers.  Thus, one
</I>&gt;<i> update from any attached GPS should inform an RTCM station about all
</I>&gt;<i> devices.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A previous remark of yours implied that RTCM transmitters use the
</I>&gt;<i> update to filter what information they ship back.  If so, this could
</I>&gt;<i> be a problem for using GPSD as a whole-sky observatory.  It implies that
</I>&gt;<i> we might need a mechanism to spoof RTCM stations about our location.
</I>
I was not aware of the NMEA updates up to the time the ntrip server kept
closing the connection on me. I don't think that this is necessary for
all NTRIP servers. It just doesn't hurt and is necessary for some.

The filtering on the server side is an assumption from me. I cannot
imagine any other purpose of regular NMEA updates. It frees a client of
the necessity to choose the nearest NTRIP caster/mountpoint, if the
caster already does the selection of reference stations for the client.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I really have no clear idea how a GPS device is chosen for one (or more)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NTRIP server or how an RTCM stream is chosen for any GPS device.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, how a  GPS device is chosen for one (or more) NTRIP servers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Look near gpsd.c:1420.  When a TPV has been received from any device
</I>&gt;<i> (the REPORT_IS bit is on in the change mask) and the device has a 3D
</I>&gt;<i> fix, then the code walks through all other devices calling netgnss_report()
</I>&gt;<i> to attempt to ship a notification to them. netgnss_report() is expected
</I>&gt;<i> to pick out devices that are DGNSS casters and call the right handler;
</I>&gt;<i> in your case that'sntrip_report().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this code has changed since when you last looked at it.  While
</I>&gt;<i> preparing this reply I finally understood your previous remark about
</I>&gt;<i> the problem with making dsock device-local.  The gpsd.c code
</I>&gt;<i> referenced in the above paragraph, and a change to
</I>&gt;<i> {netgnss,dgpsip,ntrip}_report that makes them take three arguments each,
</I>&gt;<i> should fix this.
</I>
It seems as if it does. The current head does almost everything I
intended it to do with the first big change.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also found the global ntrip_stream variable.  For future reference,
</I>&gt;<i> globals like that are *forbidden* in GPSD.  The reason is that the entire
</I>&gt;<i> lower level of GPSD is structured as a library that is meant to be called by
</I>&gt;<i> different applications. Currently there are four such, gpsd and gpsctl
</I>&gt;<i> and gpsmon and gpsdecode.  Things that would be globals belong in the
</I>&gt;<i> contetxt structure.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, the contents of ntrip_stream is logically part of the
</I>&gt;<i> device state associated with a caster, and I have moved it there along
</I>&gt;<i> with the parsing context.
</I>
I did not know the history of NTRIP support then and just assumed there
was a good reason for the global ntrip_stream variable, which was
already there. It was quite convenient and so I used it. Good thing it's
gone though :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next, how an RTCM stream is chosen for any GPS device:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, no real &quot;choosing&quot; is done.  When a GPS activates, the last
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM2 packet seen (if there is one in the context buffer) is shipped 
</I>&gt;<i> to it first thing.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                                                                   There
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has to be *something* figuring out the best RTCM stream for GPS devices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and *something* figuring out an appropriate GPS device, which is used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the NMEA updates for the NTRIP server. Maybe something really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple, like the first connected RTCM stream for any GPS device. And the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first GPS device with a 3D fix as the source for the NTRIP servers NMEA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updates. This can surely be improved by e.g. taking DOP values into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> account, but I don't know enough about the whole system to even make an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> educated guess as to what would be appropriate here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be a filtering policy.  Currently, we don't have one.  If we
</I>&gt;<i> decide to implement one, that belongs in gpsd.c as part of the dispatcher
</I>&gt;<i> logic.  Let's get the mechanism right first, then worry about that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think the code is OK as is. The global context buffer is atomically
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> updated every time an RTCM2 or RTCM3 packet is recognized. Thus rtcm_relay()
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will always ship the last packet received to all devices from that buffer.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RTCM data from multiple devices won't be scrambled together.  At worst,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you could have a dependency from the order in which multiple RTCM devices 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are polled to which GPSes get which correction packets.  If you think that's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a problem, it could be fixed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see anywhere, that RTCM data has to be sent only as complete
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packets. This is streamed and can arrive in chunks. So if the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buffer is used for multiple devices you may get broken data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dev1 sends: 1 2 3 4 5
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dev2 sends: A B C D E
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rtcm_buf contains: 1 2 A B C 3 ..
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the point is clear here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but you have missed a subtlety in how RTCM2 is handled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are actually two state machines running in parallel in the
</I>&gt;<i> packet sniffer.  One of them is a conventional character-oriented
</I>&gt;<i> state machine, resembling a compiler's lexical analyzer that is used
</I>&gt;<i> to recognize packets from GPS and AIS receivers.  Most of packet.c
</I>&gt;<i> implements this.  It updates the session packet buffer directly and
</I>&gt;<i> never touches the context rtcmbuf.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other is a bitstream state recognizer for the ISGPS over-the-air
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, which is what RTCM2 uses.  It is implemented in isgps.c (under
</I>&gt;<i> a thin wrapper provided by driver_rtcm2_decode.c).  The bitstream
</I>&gt;<i> recognizer does not update the session buffer, *and never touches the
</I>&gt;<i> context rtcmbuf either*.  Instead, it decodes into session-&gt;isgps.buf.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each state machine is instantiated once for each device, and each
</I>&gt;<i> device has its own buffering for incoming packets, including RTCM2 packets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the bitstream recognizer tells the packet sniffer that it has
</I>&gt;<i> received an entire RTCM2 packet from a device, the packet is copied
</I>&gt;<i> to the context RTCM2 buf (code is near gpsd.c:1394).  Thus, the context
</I>&gt;<i> rtcmbuf always contains either nothing or an entire RTCM2 packet, the
</I>&gt;<i> last one to be seen.
</I>
I thought it might be like that about an hour after I sent the mail.
Good to know, it actually works this way. But the rtcm buffer is still
used for multiple, different and possibly differently formatted rtcm
streams. Any GPS device gets a mix of different corrections from
different rtcm sources (,if there are more than one) and I don't think,
that this will work very well.

I think the current model works fine with one rtcm source and maybe
multiple gps sources. But it is not optimal, when it comes to multiple
rtcm sources.

IMHO a better approach would be to pass the first (or one somehow
marked) rtcm devices data to all gps devices and don't use any other
rtcm data for gps devices. This way a client still gets all the rtcm
data but GPS devices are not confused with multiple streams of possibly
conflicting data.


BTW: The current git master works for as long as an NTRIP connection is
alive. A reconnect does not however. If the server closes the
connection, it should be reestablished as soon as possible. This was the
case before the big code changes. Now it closes the connection and
nothing happens. Even after a WATCH command from a client I get a

&quot;gpsd:ERROR: <A HREF="ntrip://XXXXX:XXXXX@www.sapos-ni-ntrip.de:2101/EPS_NI:">ntrip://XXXXX:XXXXX@www.sapos-ni-ntrip.de:2101/EPS_NI:</A>
device activation failed.&quot;

from gpsd. I have to track down the exact reason for that.
