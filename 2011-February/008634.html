<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Anyway. I don't think this is critical at all. NTRIP did not work at all
</I>&gt;<i> before this, so I don't think there are any users. The main use case of
</I>&gt;<i> one GPS receiver and one RTCM/DGPS source is fully supported as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> we sort the last bug out.
</I>
Right.  We can worry about the rare case later.

&gt;<i> No. A reference station sends correction data for particular satellites.
</I>&gt;<i> The correction data depend on position of the station and some other
</I>&gt;<i> factors (weather ...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you get correction data from two different reference stations, they
</I>&gt;<i> are most definitely different for the same satellite. So they conflict
</I>&gt;<i> with each other.
</I>
But can't this happen even if you have only a single RTCM source?

A single RTCM2 source sends you what is in effect a stream of corrections
tagged by reference station ID and satellite PRN (or at least that is how
I undertstand the Type 1 and Type 9 messages).  The RTCM interpreter in
the GPS must have some way to resolve this &quot;conflict&quot;.

Now we move up to multiple RTCM sources.  The aggregate of these is
still just a a stream of corrections tagged by reference station ID
and satellite PRN.

I don't see why this is more difficult to handle, unless you're
telling me that a single RTCM source never ships corrections for more
than one reference station.

&gt;<i> &gt; The reason I need to know this is that I plan on feature-freezing for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the release as soon as you tell me the Ntrip support is in good shape.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As if I haven't got enough pressure already :-)
</I>
Sorry.  You just happen to be at the top of the bugs-to-be-fixed list
this time around.  One would think you'd be happy with that position
of priority :-).

I'm really, really happy that we have a live Ntrip user who knows what
he's doing.  The dusty state of that code had been bothering me for
literally *years*.
