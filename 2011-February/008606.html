</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thats good. I hope there are not more of these parts, where NTRIP needs a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> special treatment. At least it now works for you and me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alas, the drama may not quite be over.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I looked at the guard patch.  It would have worked as written, but it smelled
</I>&gt;<i> bad to me.  The stink arose from the fact that there isn't any obvious 
</I>&gt;<i> relationship between a GNSS service type in the global context and whether
</I>&gt;<i> an individual, local sensor, should be probed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I started digging.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I quickly found a better point patch for that guard, using the is_serial 
</I>&gt;<i> member of the device structure.  But in the process I unearthed a far more
</I>&gt;<i> noxious stench.
</I>
I really like the is_serial approach. I just took the least intrusive thing I
could think of for the guard, so nothing but ntrip was affected.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't really looked at the global context members related to
</I>&gt;<i> DGPS/NTRIP in a long time.  The code implementing those features came in 
</I>&gt;<i> from third parties, seemed to work, and wasn't intrusive, so I merged it 
</I>&gt;<i> without thinking much about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Turns out those global context members reflected a baked-in assumption
</I>&gt;<i> that gpsd would only ever be connected to one DGPS service at a time.
</I>
I was aware of that assumption (I thought the dsock was a dead giveaway).
I don't think its necessarily bad, because I doubt the ability of many
GPS devices to be able to work with different streams of correction data.
Let alone, when they are mangled in the context-&gt;rtcm_buf, which is still
global.

It definitely needs some catching and erroring out if someone wants to
provide more than one of those.

&gt;<i> They might even have predated my rewrite to support multiple
</I>&gt;<i> sensors. In the architecture we have now, after that rewrite, this is
</I>&gt;<i> a pretty serious orthogonality violation. Thus the stench.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All that global context state needed to become per-device state. I've
</I>&gt;<i> done that, now, but it did require significant core code changes.
</I>&gt;<i> We're therefore back to prerelease state Blue (1).  I have a bit more
</I>&gt;<i> cleanup to do before asking Gary to re-test on the Garmins.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Andre, please pull head and test.  It'd be nice to know I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> broken the NTRIP support.
</I>
See my other mail for a patch, that make the ntrip connection part work again.

Another thing that I just confirmed is that ntrip_report() is no longer called.
This is crucial to keep the connection alive. The server may determine what
data to send depending on the current position of the client. So the NTRIP
server needs a position from the client to work properly.

It seems that net_gnss_dispatch is now only called for devices, that have a
3D Fix, which is really not possible for an RTCM device.

This worked before exactly because of the dsock member, which was used just
for that kind of stuff.
