Well, I did not think or even know of that. :-) You are obviously right,
but there are some implications, when you allow more than one dgps/rtcm
device. See below.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It definitely needs some catching and erroring out if someone wants to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide more than one of those.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose I should make the RTCM buffer per-device.  Other than that 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see a problem.
</I>
If every RTCM emitting device has a seperate RTCM buffer, how is it
determined, which RTCM buffer is pushed into which device? The NTRIP
server offers one RTCM stream, which has to be uploaded to any GPS
device, which supports it.

The NTRIP server needs an NMEA update from one active GPS device. I'd
really dislike mixing updates from different devices, even if the
difference between the data is marginal.

I really have no clear idea how a GPS device is chosen for one (or more)
NTRIP server or how an RTCM stream is chosen for any GPS device. There
has to be *something* figuring out the best RTCM stream for GPS devices
and *something* figuring out an appropriate GPS device, which is used
for the NMEA updates for the NTRIP server. Maybe something really
simple, like the first connected RTCM stream for any GPS device. And the
first GPS device with a 3D fix as the source for the NTRIP servers NMEA
updates. This can surely be improved by e.g. taking DOP values into
account, but I don't know enough about the whole system to even make an
educated guess as to what would be appropriate here.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See my other mail for a patch, that make the ntrip connection part work again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Applied and pushed.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another thing that I just confirmed is that ntrip_report() is no longer called.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is crucial to keep the connection alive. The server may determine what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data to send depending on the current position of the client. So the NTRIP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server needs a position from the client to work properly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems that net_gnss_dispatch is now only called for devices, that have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3D Fix, which is really not possible for an RTCM device.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This worked before exactly because of the dsock member, which was used just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for that kind of stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this can easily be fixed.  Give me an hour or two.
</I>
Gladly :-). I might be gone for the weekend though. But I'll try to look
into my mails again today.
