<PRE>Andre, I'm merging in your previous question.  This reply is intended
to put on the record how the RTCM2 support is supposed to work so that
you and others can review it.

If anything I say here is not a correct description, that itself is a
bug that needs to be fixed.  Please check my statements.  To assist
checking, I will try to identify the code regions that implement each
behavior.

Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>If every RTCM emitting device has a seperate RTCM buffer, how is it
</I>&gt;<i>determined, which RTCM buffer is pushed into which device? The NTRIP
</I>&gt;<i>server offers one RTCM stream, which has to be uploaded to any GPS
</I>&gt;<i>device, which supports it.
</I>
Every RTCM2 packet received is copied to every activated GPS.  See
gpsd.c near line 1977; this is the first thing done when a new device is
polled.  The implementation is in net_gnss_dispatch.c:rtcm_relay().
It copies from a global, shared RTCM buffer to the device.  I'll
describe how this buffer is updated in a bit.

&gt;<i>The NTRIP server needs an NMEA update from one active GPS device. I'd
</I>&gt;<i>really dislike mixing updates from different devices, even if the
</I>&gt;<i>difference between the data is marginal.
</I>
One assumption that the code does presently make is that all GPses
attached to the daemon are near each other from the point of view of
an RTCM station many kilometers distant.  This assumption seems safe
because the maximum cable traverse for RS-232, USB and Bluetooth
connections is measured in meters rather than kilometers.  Thus, one
update from any attached GPS should inform an RTCM station about all
devices.

A previous remark of yours implied that RTCM transmitters use the
update to filter what information they ship back.  If so, this could
be a problem for using GPSD as a whole-sky observatory.  It implies that
we might need a mechanism to spoof RTCM stations about our location.

&gt;<i>I really have no clear idea how a GPS device is chosen for one (or more)
</I>&gt;<i>NTRIP server or how an RTCM stream is chosen for any GPS device.
</I>
First, how a  GPS device is chosen for one (or more) NTRIP servers:

Look near gpsd.c:1420.  When a TPV has been received from any device
(the REPORT_IS bit is on in the change mask) and the device has a 3D
fix, then the code walks through all other devices calling netgnss_report()
to attempt to ship a notification to them. netgnss_report() is expected
to pick out devices that are DGNSS casters and call the right handler;
in your case that'sntrip_report().

Yes, this code has changed since when you last looked at it.  While
preparing this reply I finally understood your previous remark about
the problem with making dsock device-local.  The gpsd.c code
referenced in the above paragraph, and a change to
{netgnss,dgpsip,ntrip}_report that makes them take three arguments each,
should fix this.

I also found the global ntrip_stream variable.  For future reference,
globals like that are *forbidden* in GPSD.  The reason is that the entire
lower level of GPSD is structured as a library that is meant to be called by
different applications. Currently there are four such, gpsd and gpsctl
and gpsmon and gpsdecode.  Things that would be globals belong in the
contetxt structure.  

In this case, the contents of ntrip_stream is logically part of the
device state associated with a caster, and I have moved it there along
with the parsing context.

Next, how an RTCM stream is chosen for any GPS device:

Currently, no real &quot;choosing&quot; is done.  When a GPS activates, the last
RTCM2 packet seen (if there is one in the context buffer) is shipped 
to it first thing.  

&gt;<i>                                                                   There
</I>&gt;<i>has to be *something* figuring out the best RTCM stream for GPS devices
</I>&gt;<i>and *something* figuring out an appropriate GPS device, which is used
</I>&gt;<i>for the NMEA updates for the NTRIP server. Maybe something really
</I>&gt;<i>simple, like the first connected RTCM stream for any GPS device. And the
</I>&gt;<i>first GPS device with a 3D fix as the source for the NTRIP servers NMEA
</I>&gt;<i>updates. This can surely be improved by e.g. taking DOP values into
</I>&gt;<i>account, but I don't know enough about the whole system to even make an
</I>&gt;<i>educated guess as to what would be appropriate here.
</I>
This would be a filtering policy.  Currently, we don't have one.  If we
decide to implement one, that belongs in gpsd.c as part of the dispatcher
logic.  Let's get the mechanism right first, then worry about that.

&gt;<i> &gt; I think the code is OK as is. The global context buffer is atomically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; updated every time an RTCM2 or RTCM3 packet is recognized. Thus rtcm_relay()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will always ship the last packet received to all devices from that buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RTCM data from multiple devices won't be scrambled together.  At worst,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you could have a dependency from the order in which multiple RTCM devices 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are polled to which GPSes get which correction packets.  If you think that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a problem, it could be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see anywhere, that RTCM data has to be sent only as complete
</I>&gt;<i> packets. This is streamed and can arrive in chunks. So if the same
</I>&gt;<i> buffer is used for multiple devices you may get broken data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> dev1 sends: 1 2 3 4 5
</I>&gt;<i> dev2 sends: A B C D E
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> rtcm_buf contains: 1 2 A B C 3 ..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the point is clear here.
</I>
Yes, but you have missed a subtlety in how RTCM2 is handled.

There are actually two state machines running in parallel in the
packet sniffer.  One of them is a conventional character-oriented
state machine, resembling a compiler's lexical analyzer that is used
to recognize packets from GPS and AIS receivers.  Most of packet.c
implements this.  It updates the session packet buffer directly and
never touches the context rtcmbuf.

The other is a bitstream state recognizer for the ISGPS over-the-air
protocol, which is what RTCM2 uses.  It is implemented in isgps.c (under
a thin wrapper provided by driver_rtcm2_decode.c).  The bitstream
recognizer does not update the session buffer, *and never touches the
context rtcmbuf either*.  Instead, it decodes into session-&gt;isgps.buf.

Each state machine is instantiated once for each device, and each
device has its own buffering for incoming packets, including RTCM2 packets.

When the bitstream recognizer tells the packet sniffer that it has
received an entire RTCM2 packet from a device, the packet is copied
to the context RTCM2 buf (code is near gpsd.c:1394).  Thus, the context
rtcmbuf always contains either nothing or an entire RTCM2 packet, the
last one to be seen.
