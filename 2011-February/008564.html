&gt;<i> Bringing CLOSE_DELAY to 0.2s solved the problem.
</I>
I believe it. That's the one I was expecting you'd have to bump up
when I heard your bug report.  Thanks.

&gt;<i>                                             I've been looking at
</I>&gt;<i> traces (ktrace -i, so I see timestamps for all the system calls of both
</I>&gt;<i> gpsfake and gpsd), and I don't yet see what's wrong.
</I>
It's some sort of obscure buffering artifact, highly prone to flaky
variations across platforms and kernels. Used to play all kinds of
cross-platform hell with the regression-test suite, and then turned
out to be masking a deep platform-independent bug in gpd's data
management that produced *exactly the same symptoms*.  See my
commit comment of Tue Jul 15 10:49:37 2008 +0000 for details.

&gt;<i> Is CLOSE_DELAY supposed to be the delay from sending the last bit of
</I>&gt;<i> fake input before telling gpsd to remove the source?
</I>
Exactly.  The idea is to give the buffers in the OS and Python
userland time to flush.  Sigh...  yes, I know it's voodoo programming.

&gt;<i> Is there supposed to be a delay between telling gpsd to remove the
</I>&gt;<i> source (and getting the OK back) and sending the signal to kill gpsd?
</I>&gt;<i> That seems to happen in mere microseconds.   But I think the
</I>&gt;<i> input/remove delay is the one that matters.
</I>
I think so too.

&gt;<i> I'm not clearly seeing the effects of CLOSE_DELAY in the trace.
</I>
Well, you wouldn't, necessarily.  There's some combination of OS-level 
buffering, C-level buffering in the Python core, and Python-level buffering
implicated here.  Only the first kind would tend to show up in a trace.

&gt;<i> Also, I noticed that gpsd calls nanosleep for longish periods (333 ms?)
</I>&gt;<i> due to the garmin driver.  It would seem that a) this is a problem in
</I>&gt;<i> and of itself and b) one would have to wait for at least those delays to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that gpsd had time to finish.
</I>
Checking...yes, there are a couple of places we have to usleep() for
hardware-interface reasons (the SiRF driver does it too).  I try to
avoid them, but the infrastructure required to maintain state for
delayed writes without blocking would be *hideously* complex and
bug-prone.

Good point about the cumulated writes.  That may behind the rare timing-
dependent regression failures I still get.  I'll look into it a bit
further.
