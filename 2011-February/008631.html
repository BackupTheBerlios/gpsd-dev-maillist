<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The code currently checks for both RTCM2_IS and RTCM3_is. I am very
</I>&gt;<i> skeptical as to the ability of GPS devices to mix these things.
</I>
That implies a good question.  I don't know which device types accept RTCM2
versus which accept RTCM3 - GPS spec sheets generally just say DGPS-capable and
don't specify further.  

In the absence of that knowledge, all we can do is spray all incoming RTCM2
and RTCM3 streams at all attached DGPS-capable devices and hope they sort
it out.  

One reason this seems like the least bad thing to do is the checksumming
on RTCM2 and RTCM3 and most GPS packets - it means devices that can't 
interpret a given packet type will simply discard it as noise.

(It is probably not coincidence that the only device types without
effective checksums - TSIP and Garmin - don't accept DGPS corrections.)

If you have any better method to propose I'd love to hear it.

&gt;<i> The filtering on the server side is an assumption from me. I cannot
</I>&gt;<i> imagine any other purpose of regular NMEA updates. It frees a client of
</I>&gt;<i> the necessity to choose the nearest NTRIP caster/mountpoint, if the
</I>&gt;<i> caster already does the selection of reference stations for the client.
</I>
I agree this seems like the most logical use for that information. But
I think we need to get actual information on this, rather than merely
conjecturing, before we try to do anything about it. 

Googling for &quot;ntrip caster source code&quot; seems to yield some good hits.
Perhaps you can look into this?

&gt;<i>                              The current head does almost everything I
</I>&gt;<i> intended it to do with the first big change.
</I>
Good.  I see from reading forward a bit that you confirm it's working live.

&gt;<i> I think the current model works fine with one rtcm source and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> multiple gps sources. But it is not optimal, when it comes to multiple
</I>&gt;<i> rtcm sources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO a better approach would be to pass the first (or one somehow
</I>&gt;<i> marked) rtcm devices data to all gps devices and don't use any other
</I>&gt;<i> rtcm data for gps devices. This way a client still gets all the rtcm
</I>&gt;<i> data but GPS devices are not confused with multiple streams of possibly
</I>&gt;<i> conflicting data.
</I>
I'm not sure why you think mixing RTCM from different sources would be 
a problem. As I look at the semantics of RTCM2 and RTCM3 message types,
it looks to me like each correction record is independent of what caster
source it comes from, and the worst that can happen if you mix sources
is that you get duplicate corrections.

I can't imagine any plausible scenario in which this would confuse a GPS.
What failure case are you actually worried about?

&gt;<i> BTW: The current git master works for as long as an NTRIP connection is
</I>&gt;<i> alive. A reconnect does not however. If the server closes the
</I>&gt;<i> connection, it should be reestablished as soon as possible. This was the
</I>&gt;<i> case before the big code changes. Now it closes the connection and
</I>&gt;<i> nothing happens. Even after a WATCH command from a client I get a
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;gpsd:ERROR: <A HREF="ntrip://XXXXX:XXXXX@www.sapos-ni-ntrip.de:2101/EPS_NI:">ntrip://XXXXX:XXXXX@www.sapos-ni-ntrip.de:2101/EPS_NI:</A>
</I>&gt;<i> device activation failed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> from gpsd. I have to track down the exact reason for that.
</I>
OK, so we still have one known bug.  

Please get back to me soon with an evaluation of what will be required
to fix this.  Useful answers would be of the form &quot;about N days&quot; or
&quot;I don't need this before the next release ships&quot;.

The reason I need to know this is that I plan on feature-freezing for
the release as soon as you tell me the Ntrip support is in good shape.
