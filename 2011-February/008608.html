<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> It definitely needs some catching and erroring out if someone wants to
</I>&gt;<i> provide more than one of those.
</I>
I think the code is OK as is. The global context buffer is atomically
updated every time an RTCM2 or RTCM3 packet is recognized. Thus rtcm_relay()
will always ship the last packet received to all devices from that buffer.

RTCM data from multiple devices won't be scrambled together.  At worst,
you could have a dependency from the order in which multiple RTCM devices 
are polled to which GPSes get which correction packets.  If you think that's
a problem, it could be fixed.

&gt;<i> It seems that net_gnss_dispatch is now only called for devices, that have a
</I>&gt;<i> 3D Fix, which is really not possible for an RTCM device.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This worked before exactly because of the dsock member, which was used just
</I>&gt;<i> for that kind of stuff.
</I>
I'm unclear about the problem you're seeing.  Assuming you actually mean
netgnss_report(), we certainly can't call that *before* some device has 
a fix.  The logic near gpsd.c:1428 calls netgnss_report() as soon as we
have one.  Or am I missing something?
