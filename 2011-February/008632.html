</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That implies a good question.  I don't know which device types accept RTCM2

</I>&gt;<i> In the absence of that knowledge, all we can do is spray all incoming RTCM2

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (It is probably not coincidence that the only device types without

</I>
The problem I see is the generic nature of gpsd. It takes any device and
forwards the data to a client. In case of dgps/ntrip/rtcm it tries to
mangle everything together. Every GPS gets every rtcm message and every
ntrip caster gets a fix from every gps device. I just doubt that that is
a good idea and cannot imagine anybody who would want this.

We probably need a way to configure which gps device gets which data
etc.. Not every device can handle all data. I imagine this can already
partly be done via a control socket, but then the implications of having
multiple rtcm sources have to be made clear somehow to somebody trying it.

Anyway. I don't think this is critical at all. NTRIP did not work at all
before this, so I don't think there are any users. The main use case of
one GPS receiver and one RTCM/DGPS source is fully supported as soon as
we sort the last bug out.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The filtering on the server side is an assumption from me. I cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imagine any other purpose of regular NMEA updates. It frees a client of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the necessity to choose the nearest NTRIP caster/mountpoint, if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> caster already does the selection of reference stations for the client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree this seems like the most logical use for that information. But
</I>&gt;<i> I think we need to get actual information on this, rather than merely
</I>&gt;<i> conjecturing, before we try to do anything about it.
</I>
I'll try to verify this with the guys who operate the caster.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Googling for &quot;ntrip caster source code&quot; seems to yield some good hits.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you can look into this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                              The current head does almost everything I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intended it to do with the first big change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good.  I see from reading forward a bit that you confirm it's working live.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the current model works fine with one rtcm source and maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple gps sources. But it is not optimal, when it comes to multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rtcm sources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO a better approach would be to pass the first (or one somehow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> marked) rtcm devices data to all gps devices and don't use any other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rtcm data for gps devices. This way a client still gets all the rtcm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data but GPS devices are not confused with multiple streams of possibly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conflicting data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure why you think mixing RTCM from different sources would be 
</I>&gt;<i> a problem. As I look at the semantics of RTCM2 and RTCM3 message types,
</I>&gt;<i> it looks to me like each correction record is independent of what caster
</I>&gt;<i> source it comes from, and the worst that can happen if you mix sources
</I>&gt;<i> is that you get duplicate corrections.
</I>
No. A reference station sends correction data for particular satellites.
The correction data depend on position of the station and some other
factors (weather ...).

If you get correction data from two different reference stations, they
are most definitely different for the same satellite. So they conflict
with each other.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't imagine any plausible scenario in which this would confuse a GPS.
</I>&gt;<i> What failure case are you actually worried about?
</I>
When the data is from different stations it will differ and the GPS gets
(or may get) different correction data for the same satellite. The
properties (e.g. position) and data of one reference station are not in
the same rtcm message and cannot be associated with each other if
another reference station is mixed into the data.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW: The current git master works for as long as an NTRIP connection is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alive. A reconnect does not however. If the server closes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection, it should be reestablished as soon as possible. This was the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case before the big code changes. Now it closes the connection and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing happens. Even after a WATCH command from a client I get a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;gpsd:ERROR: <A HREF="ntrip://XXXXX:XXXXX@www.sapos-ni-ntrip.de:2101/EPS_NI:">ntrip://XXXXX:XXXXX@www.sapos-ni-ntrip.de:2101/EPS_NI:</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> device activation failed.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from gpsd. I have to track down the exact reason for that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so we still have one known bug.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please get back to me soon with an evaluation of what will be required
</I>&gt;<i> to fix this.  Useful answers would be of the form &quot;about N days&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I don't need this before the next release ships&quot;.
</I>
Give me until tomorrow at this time. I'll try to find this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I need to know this is that I plan on feature-freezing for
</I>&gt;<i> the release as soon as you tell me the Ntrip support is in good shape.
</I>
As if I haven't got enough pressure already :-)
