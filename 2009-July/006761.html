<PRE>And this is why I start these threads on the lists... because I always
miss something in the first draft :)

&gt;<i> Note that some receivers will also give you measurements to

</I>
Yeah, I forgot that at least my ublox receiver will allow ranging with
SBAS PRNS. My other receivers don't - they just use SBAS as a source
of corrections.

&gt;<i> There's several data structures you could use, as I'm sure you're
</I>&gt;<i> aware. IMHO a good choice is to just list the measurements in an array
</I>&gt;<i> sorted by PRN. The software that reads in your information will
</I>&gt;<i> probably immediately convert the data into its own internal data
</I>&gt;<i> structures.
</I>
I was thinking about sorting by PRN... I guess I could do that
provided I store which receiver channel reported it. It could be
useful to detect a misbehaving channel or to detect when a receiver
decides to switch channels for tracking a PRN - I hear these things
happen, and they can introduce jumps into navigation solutions.

I guess I could have a list of MAXCHANNELS measurements, protected by
--enable-raw. Waitaminnit - that could be trouble when someone hooks
me up with a 216 channels Javad Triumph receiver.

&gt;<i> Unless you're planning to do any raw-measurement
</I>&gt;<i> calculations within GPSD?
</I>
Not within gpsd itself. Validation (DOP checks, error estimation) is
within gpsd's scope, actually doing navigation solutions is not. I'd
rather find a protocol I can use to stream out raw measurements and
let something else handle the solutions. I'm thinking either BINEX or
RT-IGS as the output format, and then use that to feed GPSTK, GNSSTK,
Sweetgps, Kinetic, ...

&gt;<i> Or you could just throw away data for SV PRNs above 32 - not sure many
</I>&gt;<i> people use that data :)
</I>
Take two aspirin and remain where you are - my power stapler and I are
coming to visit. :) Just kidding. But I really don't like the idea of
throwing away data.

&gt;<i> Perhaps I'm being dense, but what is pseudorange, as opposed to being
</I>&gt;<i> either code phase or carrier phase?
</I>
Pseudorange is a magical approximation of distance between you and the
SV. Code and carrier phase are the actual observables used to get
there. I know that sounded a little snarky, but some receivers give
you only one of code, carrier or (maybe carrier-smoothed) pseudorange.
I'm trying to come up with a format that stores, with maximal
fidelity, any receiver's output. I guess I don't need to worry about
being able to convert UBX into SiRF, so we can do some conversion in
each driver.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; double deltarange[MAXCHANNELS]; &#160; &#160; /* meters/sec */
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; double doppler[MAXCHANNELS]; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;/* Hz */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, aren't those the same measurements? Just with different units?
</I>
For now, I'm just extracting whatever the receiver said. I can be
convinced to convert into one or the other - which would make more
sense?

&gt;<i> Also, on the Doppler I would consider not just the comment &quot;Hz&quot; but
</I>&gt;<i> also &quot;positive for approaching satellites&quot;; likewise on the deltarange
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;negative for approaching satellites&quot;.
</I>
Good call.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; double mtime[MAXCHANNELS]; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;/* sec */
</I>&gt;<i> GPS time or UTC time?
</I>
hardware dependent, but probably never UTC.
- In SiRF hardware, it's &quot;an internal millisecond counter which has no
direct relationship to GPS time&quot;.
- Itrax also seems to use an internal clock: &quot;The reference TOW with
respect to which the pseudoranges are computed. This time is not
necessarily a good indication of the receiver or satellite TOW.&quot;
- Ashtech/Thales/Magellan is another internal clock: &quot;Sequence ID
number in units of 50 ms, modulo 30 minutes&quot;
- Ublox says &quot;Measurement integer millisecond GPS time of week&quot;.
- Superstar2 uses &quot;Predicted GPS time. This is the time when the
measurement samples have been taken at the receiver.&quot;
- Trimble seems to be GPS time: &quot;The time of measurement (Byte 17) is
the center of the sample interval adjusted by adding the receiver
supplied codephase (module mS) to a user determined integer number of
mS between user and satellite.&quot;

&gt;<i> Some more properties you might consider including:
</I>&gt;<i> a. Possible cycle slip between last measurement and this one. (i.e. Rinex LLI)
</I>&gt;<i> b. Whether ambiguities are full-cycle or half-cycle (such as from a
</I>&gt;<i> squaring receiver); u-blox antaris receivers give half-cycle-ambiguous
</I>&gt;<i> information out when they first acquire a signal, before switching to
</I>&gt;<i> full-cycle. (i.e. Rinex LLI)
</I>
yep. i figured there'd be a bunch of other flags and such to throw in.
that's why i estimated 64B of state per PRN.

&gt;<i> c. Time in seconds since last (suspected) cycle slip. (this is only
</I>&gt;<i> useful if you're sending the data over a lossy channel)
</I>
you mean something like time-in-track? some receivers give us this,
some don't. i guess we can compute it.

&gt;<i> d. You could include the signal-to-noise ratio, usually measured in dB-Hz.
</I>
We use that in the non-raw case so it's not inside the #ifdef. See
&quot;float ss[MAXCHANNELS]&quot; further up.

&gt;<i> If you check out this file in u-center you should observe the presence
</I>&gt;<i> of EGNOS satellites, and occasional half-cycle ambiguities and
</I>&gt;<i> similar: <A HREF="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wimrc/about/people/tandy/ubx-rxm-raw_log_file.ubx">http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wimrc/about/people/tandy/ubx-rxm-raw_log_file.ubx</A>
