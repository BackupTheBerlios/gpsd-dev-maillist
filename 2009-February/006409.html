  It allows the gpsd daemon to listen on a v6 socket, when started with the
  &quot;-6&quot; option.
  It also updates netlib.c, libgps.c, gpspipe.c, gpsctl.c to allow gpspipe and
  gpsctl to connect to the gpsd daemon with IPv6.


Thanks for hacking on v6 support.  I have long thought that gpsd should
support v6.  I read your patch and have quite a few comments - sorry if
this comes across as harsh - am just trying to get us where I think we
need to be as quickly as possible.

First, I think we need to talk about what the desired behavior is.  I am
used to the KAME/BSD approach to v6, which is that programs that used to
listen on a v4 socket should instead listen on both v6 and v4 and be
able to cope with incoming connections on either.  For example, one of
my machines runs DNS, and fstat shows:

named    named       4288   20* internet6 stream tcp c32e6ab8 *:53
named    named       4288  128* internet6 dgram udp c2b966b4 *:53

This is why I haven't dug in to fixing gpsd for v6: it needs a
structural change (albeit a minor one) to have multiple listening
sockets.  Listening on v6 and not v4 would be awkward and has no gradual
transition story.

I think listening on v6 should be the default for systems that have v6
support (via .h files, separate from 'a global v6 address is
configured').  It's ok to have an option for 'listen only on v4' and
'listen only on v6' - but I'm not sure it's really needed.

When given a name (with 'localhost' being the implicit name), cgps
etc. should use getaddrinfo (if it exists), and then use the first
AF/address returned, which will typically be v6.
For example:

  foobar gdt &gt; telnet localhost smtp
  Trying ::1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  220 foobar.ir.bbn.com ESMTP Postfix

goes over v6.

I would say that if netlib_ takes names, then it should perhaps just use
getaddrinfo, and perhaps should take an AF_ variable to force only a
specific family so -4 and -6 command line args can be given in case of
trouble (as ntpq and ssh do).  Sockets already defines AF_INET and
AF_INET6, so IMHO best to use those rather than define new constants.


I think gpsd runs on some systems which are too lame to have
getaddrinfo, so autoconf support is needed.
getaddrinfo is in POSIX.1 2004:
