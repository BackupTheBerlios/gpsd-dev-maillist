<PRE>Yo Gary,

Now that the &quot;good&quot; weather has arrived in Finland (afternoon temperatures 
above 16 degrees C/ 60 degrees F!!) I have been able to hang my gps antenna 
out of my window and get some signal for my Jupiter-T to slurp.

I am gathering some test data to submit with the code ready to put it in the 
SVN tree, so maybe it can get into the next release?

To the point of the subject line. I seem to remember you were not happy about 
the behaviour of the ntpd interface, or am I wrong?

Now I can get a good satellite signal and a solid 1PPS train, I looked at 
firing up the ntpd interface and I seem to be getting good interaction now.

In fact, my initial tests revealed a bug in my driver where I wrongly applied 
a leap second correction. The 1PPS was seen by ntpd as the best quality 
source and it was fighting with my public time server data. The difference 
was a magical 14000 milliseconds, so that was a good clue.

Once that was corrected, ntpd happily eats the 1PPS and gpsd-generated NMEA 
produced from my binary driver data. Here is a snapshot of ntpq -p output:-

As you can see, SHM(1) is active and SHM(0) plus one public time server are 
selected as alternates. I guess this is what we would expect? I am no expert 
on ntpd, but it looks good from what I read in &quot;man ntpq&quot; with the possible 
exception that SHM(1) has a &quot;*&quot; rather than a &quot;o&quot; which means it is seen as a 
sys.peer instead of a pps.peer. Maybe pps.peer only happens if you have 
a &quot;hardware&quot; 1PPS source rather than the output of gpsd?

On the way to getting this to work, I did find a problem with the OS's 
handling of the ntp.conf file under Fedora Core 6. It was being stomped on by 
a script file (dhclient-script) and I had to mangle that file so that 
the &quot;servers&quot; data in ntp.conf was not damaged. If you are using FC6, maybe 
it was this behaviour that caused you problems?

Best Regards

Mick Durkin
