Prolly.

I was worried about the PPS, but now I think my problem was a initialization
one that has been around a while.  I would not call it a blocking item
anymore.

I have been running the most recent SVN and only been seeing one issue.
For some reason ^C (kill) hangs for me.  Only 'kill -9' works for me.
My guess is some issue with the PPS thread but not sure.  Since no
one else has noticed it also does not look blocking to me.

Otherwise you would have to ask Chris and the rest of the usual suspects.
