My big problem is that I still can't find what causes gpsd to spin
when a high connection rate happens... ie. 10 connections suddenly
show up in a second sometimes as little as 4 connections will do it.

I was able to reproduce this on your machines, so it's not
OS-specific. If I could find and squish this one, my last release
blocker would be taken care of.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
