And then there is the 'poll()' system call to muddy the water. Twenty years 
ago on small embedded systems (maybe even today) this question had meaning in 
the 'real men' sense. Today all low level i/o on a Linux system is interrupt 
driven.  If the event itself can not raise an interrupt, the timer interrupt 
is used to 'poll'.

User land apps can of course 'poll' for events, using i.e. non blocking reads, 
and thus causing 100% cpu use without accomplishing anything.

Applications like gpsd have been so far abstracted away from real hardware, 
that the question itself becomes meaningless. The os makes sure you can do 
your work without 'busy waiting'. That is what it's there for.

From a high level application point of view, you are both kind of right. On 
the low level driver implementation it is of course interrupt driven.

Russ, who is certainly one of the 'real men' knows that. I remember it too, 
which just shows my age ;-)

Cheers,
Remco
