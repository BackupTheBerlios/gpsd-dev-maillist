<PRE>Yo Gary!

The drilling a hole option is a non-starter. The folks in the upstairs flat 
would not be too happy if I drill a hole through their floor! Also, I am a 
just a tenant here, renting from a Finnish colleague who is away on a 
university course, so I don't want to make holes in his walls.

Back home in UK I have a possibility to mount the antenna high on my roof 
above all the obstructions, so signal should be good. I will also be lower 
down the globe which might help; here is 60N and home is 53N.

Here is the output from ntpdc -p :-

I've not tried that before and don't know if it is good or not, so I will read 
the man and see what it means.

I don't use dhcp that I know of, but maybe that was some background FC6 junk 
going off. I can't remember how I found out it was dhclient-script but I 
fixed it ages ago and have had no problems since. Again, I guess I need 
to &quot;man dhcp&quot; or something to see what -N does.

You said &quot;initialization issues with PPS&quot;; can I be of help? I never noticed 
any particular problems whenever I got a decent signal and tried to interface 
to ntpd.

What do you do that causes problems? I normally run ntpd all the time, but of 
course, unless gpsd is up, the fallback is to use public servers. It seems to 
find my gpsd output immediately I start the gpsd daemon.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have not had much time, am in the middle of a divorce battle, but I have

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My divorce mess is almost over and getting some bits of free time to play

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In fact, my initial tests revealed a bug in my driver where I wrongly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applied a leap second correction. The 1PPS was seen by ntpd as the best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality source and it was fighting with my public time server data. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difference was a magical 14000 milliseconds, so that was a good clue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those leap seconds are a constant pain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once that was corrected, ntpd happily eats the 1PPS and gpsd-generated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NMEA produced from my binary driver data. Here is a snapshot of ntpq -p
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; output:-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">root at linuxbox</A> ~]# ntpq -p
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That looks great.  Try 'ntpdc -p'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe pps.peer only happens if you have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a &quot;hardware&quot; 1PPS source rather than the output of gpsd?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dunno, never noticed that before.  All I care about is the time is very
</I>&gt;<i> good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the way to getting this to work, I did find a problem with the OS's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handling of the ntp.conf file under Fedora Core 6. It was being stomped
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on by a script file (dhclient-script) and I had to mangle that file so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the &quot;servers&quot; data in ntp.conf was not damaged. If you are using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FC6, maybe it was this behaviour that caused you problems?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I rarely use dhcp, When I do I use the '-N' parameter to avoid stomping on
</I>&gt;<i> the ntpd.conf.
