&gt;<i> As you can see, SHM(1) is active and SHM(0) plus one public time server
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> selected as alternates. I guess this is what we would expect? I am no
</I>&gt;<i> expert
</I>&gt;<i> on ntpd, but it looks good from what I read in &quot;man ntpq&quot; with the
</I>&gt;<i> possible
</I>&gt;<i> exception that SHM(1) has a &quot;*&quot; rather than a &quot;o&quot; which means it is seen
</I>&gt;<i> as a
</I>&gt;<i> sys.peer instead of a pps.peer. Maybe pps.peer only happens if you have
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;hardware&quot; 1PPS source rather than the output of gpsd?
</I>
This is completely normal for the combination of gpsd and ntpd.
ntpd sees gpsd only via its &quot;shared memory&quot; interface and does not know
that SHM(1) is in fact a PPS clock.  It only knows about PPS clocks for
which it has its own drivers.  But often you would not want your GPS
receiver to be attached directly to an ntpd driver, because then you have
only time sync and no access to the other info the receiver provides.

The situation is not completely optimal, but in practice it works quite
nicely.  A driver internal to ntpd could be a bit better, but if you want
the best results you need to write a kernel driver and use kernel patches
for nanosecond timekeeping that I think are still not in the mainstream
version.
