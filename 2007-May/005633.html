Do what I did, drill a hole in your roof and permanently mount your antenna
outside.  Fill the hole with good caulking at you will have good time all
year.

</I>
I don't know what the current plans are for a new release. gpsd releases
come in spurts.

&gt;<i> To the point of the subject line. I seem to remember you were not
</I>&gt;<i> happy about the behaviour of the ntpd interface, or am I wrong?
</I>
I have not had much time, am in the middle of a divorce battle, but I have
narrowed down my problems to initialization issues with PPS.  Once it
start working it stays good.  That makes it a bit tricky to nail down.

My divorce mess is almost over and getting some bits of free time to play
with this stuff again.

&gt;<i> In fact, my initial tests revealed a bug in my driver where I wrongly applied
</I>&gt;<i> a leap second correction. The 1PPS was seen by ntpd as the best quality
</I>&gt;<i> source and it was fighting with my public time server data. The difference
</I>&gt;<i> was a magical 14000 milliseconds, so that was a good clue.
</I>
Those leap seconds are a constant pain.

&gt;<i> Once that was corrected, ntpd happily eats the 1PPS and gpsd-generated NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> produced from my binary driver data. Here is a snapshot of ntpq -p output:-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">root at linuxbox</A> ~]# ntpq -p
</I>
That looks great.  Try 'ntpdc -p'.

&gt;<i> Maybe pps.peer only happens if you have
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;hardware&quot; 1PPS source rather than the output of gpsd?
</I>
Dunno, never noticed that before.  All I care about is the time is very good.

&gt;<i> On the way to getting this to work, I did find a problem with the OS's
</I>&gt;<i> handling of the ntp.conf file under Fedora Core 6. It was being stomped on by
</I>&gt;<i> a script file (dhclient-script) and I had to mangle that file so that
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;servers&quot; data in ntp.conf was not damaged. If you are using FC6, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> it was this behaviour that caused you problems?
</I>
I rarely use dhcp, When I do I use the '-N' parameter to avoid stomping on
the ntpd.conf.
