<PRE>&gt;<i> Keeping the cell-ID to location mapping update sounds like a nightmare.
</I>
The key for GSM positioning is DB with infomation about positions of GSM cells
that is true. It creates new game, &quot;gsmdriving&quot;... ;-) In our country several
people were able to create complex DB. This DB could be build with some
software tools, something like wardriving (I don't know how current DB was
created, many GSM cells were reported by users through www interface). A GPS
unit and GSM mobile connected to the same PC/notebook could do the this job
too.

Accuracy of position from GSM cell id is much worse as position from GPS but
on the other side GSM signal is in places where GPS has no signal, like inside
buildings. Towns have good coverage with many GSM cells.

GPS position is good enougth for some applications like wardriving or track of
proffesional drivers where you don't need to know exact position but you are
interested only in driver area.

Maybe that gpsd could offer some universal interface that will enable to
connect &quot;non GPS&quot; source of information. This could be a socket with well
defined API. Just an idea, I don't know how complex this could be. I guess
that driver fr &quot;GSM based GPS&quot; will be more complex and shouldn't be part of
gpsd (access to DB, possible internet queries, etc).

Regards,
Petr
