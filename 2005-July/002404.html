<PRE>I've been off most of the weekend at a live-action roleplaying game -- playing
a Prussian mad scientist in a steampunk version of 1874 London with both
Babbage engines and magic -- but I found time to code up a first cut
at support for iTrax NMEA and iTalk binary.

The code could be completely wrong; I have no test hardware and was
working solely from the manuals.  However, if I haven't screwed up,
here's where we are:

1. The extended iTrax dialect of NMEA is fully supported.

2. There's a packet getter and a stub driver, italk.c, for the iTalk
   binary protocol.

Oleg Gusev has indicated he's ready to write the decoder.  Go to it, Oleg!

If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of legislation
should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of
criminal acts reduced by such legislation. That they cannot do so
after a century and a half of trying -- that they must sweep under the
rug the southern attempts at gun control in the 1870-1910 period, the
northeastern attempts in the 1920-1939 period, the attempts at both
Federal and State levels in 1965-1976 -- establishes the repeated,
complete and inevitable failure of gun laws to control serious crime.
        -- Senator Orrin Hatch, in a 1982 Senate Report
