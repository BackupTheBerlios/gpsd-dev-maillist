<PRE>Wolfgang S. Rupprecht:
&gt;<i> In any case, the 2 meter number almost certainly is for a differential
</I>&gt;<i> reference station that is located very close to the GPS in question.
</I>&gt;<i> The whole differential hack assumes that the paths and angles between
</I>&gt;<i> the reference station and the mobile GPS unit are similar enough that
</I>&gt;<i> one can simply subtract the path-length errors the reference station
</I>&gt;<i> is seeing from the path the mobile GPS had calculated.  If the angles
</I>&gt;<i> to the satellite are vastly different (as in the case of dgpsip from
</I>&gt;<i> across the country) one can start adding errors.  In the days of SA
</I>&gt;<i> the largest component of error was due to SA, so miscorrecting the
</I>&gt;<i> paths hardly mattered at all.  Even cross-country dgpsip was
</I>&gt;<i> worthwhile and improved accuracy.  I doubt that one would see any that
</I>&gt;<i> 2meter accuracy if one were more than a 100 miles away.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just for completeness, there are other issues too, like different
</I>&gt;<i> ionospheric and tropospheric pierce points for the rays going to the
</I>&gt;<i> reference and mobile units.  The speed of light is slightly lowered by
</I>&gt;<i> going through the atmosphere.  The amount it slows down is enough to
</I>&gt;<i> add a few meters (very roughly, up to 15 meters) of path-length error.
</I>&gt;<i> The ionosphere and troposphere aren't a constant height.  They are
</I>&gt;<i> substantially pumped up by sunlight, so taking a reading from one
</I>&gt;<i> location in heavy sun and applying it to a distant area with a lower
</I>&gt;<i> sun angle could make things quite a bit worse.  (There may also be
</I>&gt;<i> roughness associated with the layer thickness that defies modeling
</I>&gt;<i> with a simple sun-angle model.  I don't know enough about that sort of
</I>&gt;<i> thing.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In summary, while I have no problem believing the SiRF engineer that
</I>&gt;<i> you can get 2 meters accuracy from their chips when using a very close
</I>&gt;<i> reference, I fear that the average user will be getting the same 8m or
</I>&gt;<i> worse accuracy by using dgpsip.
</I>
Thank you for that *extremely* informative summary.  This is exactly
the sort of enlightenment I was after in attempting to recruit you.
I have used it to improve the ACCURACY section on the gpsd man page,
and quoted it in the HACKING document so the project won't forget it.

If I understand you correctly, then, what we really need is a curve
that relates base error to the distance from the DGPS we are using.

If we had that, we could hunt for DGPSIP feeds, watch the RTCM records 
they emit, and then dynamically compute UERE based on the correction
and lat/lon from the closest station.

Has anyone, to your knowledge, wrtten such a model?
