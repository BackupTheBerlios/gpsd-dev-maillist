<PRE>SVN head now includes an rtcmdecode program that can read RTCM104
messages and dump them in John Sanger's text-lines format.  There are
new XML manual pages describing rtcmdecode and the Sanger format.

Wolfgang, this code passes your regression test (sample.rtcm) but
it has been considerably refactored internally.  Notably, rtcm_decode
is now in a form the GPSD packet getter can use, and the RTCM packet
dumper is separated from it.  Look at rtcm.c and rtcmdecode.c to
see what's going on.  Note how trivial rtcmdecode.c is.  Also note
that rtcm_decode() is now an observer that returns a parsed message
structure.

The hooks for GPSD to treat RTCM104 as just another packet type are
mostly in place, but not yet tested.  You may recall the following
agenda:

1) Add code to packet.c that can recognize RTCM104 data packets.  This
   would be the hard part -- that format is *nasty*.

2) Write a trivial RTCM104 driver that just copies recognized packets
   into a save buffer.  Now we have RTCM104 sessions integrated into
   the gpsd architecture; we can hand RTCM104 sources like DGPS radios 
   to gpsd on the command line or via the control socket, just like GPSes.

3) Arrange for packets from any attached RTCM104 sessions to get
   automatically copied from their save buffers to any GPSes attached.

4) When there are attached RTCM104 sources, tell the daemon to serve
   these packets on port 2101.  At this point we will have replaced
   dgpsip's server function, through not yet its RTCM dumper function.

5) Get rid of the -d option by hacking open_device() so that when it
   sees a command-line option of the form server:port (with no
   embedded backslashes) it opens a socket to read from that server.
   Now any GPS-packet and RTCM data sources given on the command line
   can be remote as well as local.

6) Write a rtcmmon equivalent to sirfmon that disassembles and dumps
   RTCM packets.

As I've worked on the code, I've realized that the RTCM dumper needs to be
in really good shape (if only for testing purposes) before working on
the other stuff makes a lot of sense.  In particular, I want the
following:

* The ability to parse type 3 packets for station location.  This is
  important because eventually I'm going to want gpsd to go to central
  sources like EUREF that aggregate a bunch of DGPS feeds and pick out
  the best (e.g. closest) ones.

* More RTCM test loads including messages of differing types (3-16).

* Correct operation on big-endian processors so our PowerPC-using
  friends aren't screwed.

I can't do the first one myself, lacking the RTCM-104 standard.
Wolfgang, Chris, will anybody who has the thing please step up?

Where I'm going with this, functionally, is supporting dumping 
a Sanger-format report to gpsd clients that request connection to
an RTCM source and say 'R'.  If they say R=2 they get the raw bits.

Then, I can treat connecting to gpsd on port 2101 as a request to
stream the feeds from *all* RTCM sources to the client in R=2 mode.

Before any of happens, though, I want to have enough of an RTCM
regression-test suite that we can be sure the decoder is doing
what we want.

Don't think of it as `gun control', think of it as `victim
disarmament'. If we make enough laws, we can all be criminals.
