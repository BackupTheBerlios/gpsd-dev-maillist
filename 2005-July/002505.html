<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I find it hard to believe that it will improve things...
</I>
We already know it does from Petr's report.
 
&gt;<i> The problem we had was that an Evermore packet was recognized as a TSIP
</I>&gt;<i> packet (which could happen when reading starts at the second DLE of a
</I>&gt;<i> doubled-DLE halfway a packet) and the daemon switched to TSIP mode,
</I>
That's OK. The state machine has been told to go to state DLE_LEADER,
not TSIP_LEADER, at the end of a TSIP packet -- so it will pick up the
Evermore leader on the next one.  Outcome: the TSIP driver will see
one garbaged packet, but gpsd will recover after that and correctly 
sync up to the Evermore.  

After which, by the way, it will *not* detect TSIP again unless there
is garbage in the byte stream -- the state after EVERMORE_REGOGNIZED
is normally EVERMORE_LEADER_1, not DLE leader (I distinguished those
states precisely to accomplish this).

I recognize that there is still a problem in that the TSIP initializer
changes the link parity.  We do have to deal with that.

You suggest alternative strategies of (a) sampling more packets before
locking on to a packet type, or (b) allowing the driver to kick the
packet getter back to ground state.  I'm resisting (a) because it
would increase first-fix latency, and (b) because of the design
heuristic that single things should be done in a single place. I think
it's the packet-getter's job to validate packets -- having some tests
in the driver itself could be a maintainance headache down the road.

How about this instead; let's strengthen the driver model with a new
rule.  I am about to check in a change that will cause the driver wrap
function (if any) to get called whenever you change out of a driver,
not just when you close the associated device. (Presently only the iTrax and
Earthmate GPSes have wrapup hooks, and calling either should be quite
safe.)

You write a trivial wrap function that resets parity to 'N', If you
want to be an especially good citizen, extract the start parity from
the ttyset structure at initializer call time, save that in the TSIP
driver's piece of the private-storage union, and restore it in the
wrap function.  It is unlikely this will come up in practice, as I
know of only one other GPS that uses parity, but you never know
about the future.

This way of solving the problem is better than waiting for several packets
at start because it means that *any* time the packet machine gets fooled 
into falsely recognizing a TSIP, it can recover cleanly.
