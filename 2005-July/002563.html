I suppose part of the answer is that there isn't enough money in it
yet to make it worthwhile to try harder.  (The consumer gps
manufacturers need to start an &quot;arms race&quot; like the digital camera
folks, where every consumer is clammering for 4 megapixel cameras even
though they only have a 0.7 megapixel CRT and can't make use of the
increased capabilities at all.)

The other part of the answer is that survey grade gps's not only need
the higher resolution from the higher frequency signal, they also need
to characterize the upper atmosphere layers.  To do that they need to
look at the 1.2Ghz an L2 signal in addition to the 1.5Ghz L1.  That
means they just doubled the number of correlations they need to do
plus adding whatever front-end electronics are needed to look at this
frequency.  Hopefully the trend to software correlators and high-speed
general purpose cpu's will allow them to eventually add L2 tracking as
a free drop-in.

The last part is that some of the survey gps tricks used require
correlating information over a long time to work out some ambiguities.
(keyword: &quot;integer ambiguity&quot;) This is going to require either sitting
the gps perfectly still and letting it average things for a while or
using even more CPU power to work out the harder problem of resolving
the ambiguity for a bunch of predicted gps trajectories.  All that
extra CPU work is going to translate into more energy getting sucked
out of a portable gps's batteries.
