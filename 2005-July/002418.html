<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When seeing 0x10 0x10 in ground state, the statemachine should not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between TSIP and Evermore, but should go back hunting for more 0x10
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (DLE).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DLE DLE can be part of the data in both TSIP and Evermore, but is never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the start of a message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On rereading this, I don't understand what you're tryting to specify here
</I>&gt;<i> well enough to code it.  Send a patch, please?
</I>
I am not at home.  I understood from the report that somehow a DLE DLE was
leading to TSIP recognized, but now that I view the code I see that in
DLE_LEADER state, when another DLE is seen the machine goes back to GROUND
state.  That should be correct.

What still could happen is that a DLE DLE xx in the data is seen from the
second DLE, becomes DLE xx (xx &gt;= 0x13) and the packet is recognized as
TSIP.

There is nothing that can be done about this, I'm afraid.  TSIP has no
checksum.
Maybe the TSIP handler could return an indication when it thinks the
received packet is garbage, and the recognition should be restarted.

Or, the state machine should be reset to GROUND state after every packet
so that a single reconized TSIP packet does not make the daemon believe
this must be a Trimble receiver, and never try Evermore detection again.
(the TSIP driver will refuse all packets because they are type 02 which is
invalid, but it has no way of reporting that)
