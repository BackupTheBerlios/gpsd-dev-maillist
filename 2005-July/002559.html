</I>&gt;<i> Grrr.  That pdf won't let me cut-and-paste.

20.3.3.5.1.3 SV Health. Subframes 4 and 5 contain two types of SV
health data: (a) each of the 32 pages which contain the
clock/ephemeris related almanac data provide an eight-bit SV health
status word regarding the SV whose almanac data they carry, and (b)
the 25th page of subframe 4 and of subframe 5 jointly contain six-bit
health status data for up to 32 SVs.

The three MSBs of the eight-bit health words indicate health of the
NAV data in accordance with the code given in Table 20-VII. The
six-bit words provide a one-bit summary of the NAV data's health
status in the MSB position in accordance with paragraph 20.3.3.3.1.4.
The five LSBs of both the eight-bit and the six-bit words provide the
health status of the SV's signal components in accordance with the
code given in Table 20-VIII. A special meaning is assigned, however,
to the &quot;6 ones&quot; combination of the six-bit health words in the 25th
page of subframes 4 and 5: it indicates that &quot;the SV which has that ID
is not available and there may be no data regarding that SV in that
page of subframes 4 and 5 that is assigned to normally contain the
almanac data of that SV&quot; (NOTE: (a) this special meaning applies to
the 25th page of subframes 4 and 5 only; and (b) there may be data
regarding another SV in the almanac-page referred to above as defined
in paragraph 20.3.3.5.1.1). The health indication shall be given
relative to the &quot;as designed&quot; capabilities of each SV (as designated
by the configuration code -- see paragraph 20.3.3.5.1.6). Accordingly,
any SV which does not have a certain capability will be indicated as
&quot;healthy&quot; if the lack of this capability is inherent in its design or
it has been configured into a mode which is normal from a user
standpoint and does not require that capability.

Table 20-VII. NAV Data Health Indications
Bit Position in Page (137, 138, 139) = Indication
000 =  ALL DATA OK
001 = PARITY FAILURE -- some or all parity bad
010 = TLM/HOW FORMAT PROBLEM -- any departure from standard format
(e.g., preamble misplaced and/or incorrect, etc.), except for
incorrect Z-count, as reported in HOW
011 = Z-COUNT IN HOW BAD -- any problem with Z-count value not
reflecting actual code phase
100 = SUBFRAMES 1, 2, 3 -- one or more elements in words three through
ten of one or more subframes are bad
101 = SUBFRAMES 4, 5 -- one or more elements in words three through
ten of one or more subframes are bad
110 = ALL UPLOADED DATA BAD -- one or more elements in words three
through ten of any one (or more) subframes are bad
111 = ALL DATA BAD -- TLM word and/or HOW and one or more elements in
any one (or more) subframes are bad

&gt;<i> I can send the icd pdf to you if you don't have a copy.  It is freely
</I>&gt;<i> redistributable as far as I can tell.  It is just not freely
</I>&gt;<i> cut-and-pastable.
</I>
The one I got from ARINC is cut-and-pastable

&gt;<i> The reader's digest summary is the actual errors are quite technical
</I>&gt;<i> (and boring).  Any bit set means things aren't working at all so don't
</I>&gt;<i> even bother using that gps.
</I>
&quot;don't even bother using that satellite&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; 9. In the C message, what does the word &quot;soon&quot; associated with the new_data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field mean?  Can we pin that down to a number of seconds?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dunno.  I can't see anything in icd200c about IOD changes, so perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> its a reference station invented bit that means it sees new data but
</I>&gt;<i> is still using the old data for the next few instants.
</I>
Data is uploaded about four times a day. I think the soon bit would be
set  when an upload is commencing, so that receivers can be informed
that they're gonna need to wake up and recalculate stuff soon. I'll
have a look at my old 50bps data logs and see if I can get some
meaning out them...

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
