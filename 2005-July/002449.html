Thanks!

I'm very impressed that you managed to follow it with not a scratch of
documentation.  RTCM-SC104 has got to qualify as the most insane
protocol I ever heard of.

RTCM dgps radios put out 8-bit data in what is called Magnavox-format.
the top two bits are a tag to identify the data-stream the byte is
part of and the lower 6-bits are the next 6-bits from the data stream.

For DGPS data, the lowest 6-bits are not bit-aligned in any way shape
or form.  You basically have to shift the bits into your decoder one
bit at a time and decide if it looks right.

My goal in the code was to try to make the bit-shifting aspect of the
protocol as run-time efficient as possible.  The bits are only shifted
in one-at-a-time when looking for a lock.  After that the offset is
recorded and the CPU's barrel shifter is used to crank them over the
right amount in one go.

I believe bit-slips are always possible, so the code is prepared to
find a different bit-offset if the decoder ever loses lock.

The basic entrance point to the decode is &quot;void rtcm_decode(struct
rtcm_ctx * ctx, int c)&quot;.  The &quot;int c&quot; is really just the next magnavox
format byte passed in an int slot.  One should be able to glue this
into any RTCM byte-stream and have it work.

The one thing I never bothered to do was accommodate big-endians or
machines with ints smaller than 32-bits.
