Probably true with gpsd users. That's because gpsd is widely distributed.
This is not the case for RoadMap. In addition, RoadMap was designed to work
well with PDA, and that's a wild crowd. Each PDA distribution is incompatible
with each other (I hope Open Embedded is going to change that), so these
are used to recompiling. As a result, I get many complaints about my make
files, or when I forget to distribute one file (icon, man page, ...), or when I forget
to document dependencies, even if optional (shapelib). To keep what remains
of my sanity, I want to avoid one more compatibility/compilation problem if I can.

&gt;<i> As it happens, the public structure will change in this upcoming version,

</I>&gt;<i> sampling rates.  However, this is a backward-compatible change that will

</I>
Adding item within the structure is fine. My experience is that problems happen
when:
- a field type has changed (I would then advocate changing its name--which
open the door for a compatibility mode :-)
- a field is moved (such as to a substructure)
- a field is removed (compatibility mode could be possible, using macro).
- the conditions for a field to contain a valid value have changed.

&gt;<i> I guess the thing to do is bump the major version whenever there is a
</I>&gt;<i> backward-incompatible API or structure change.  Those will be rare in
</I>&gt;<i> the future.
</I>
That would help a lot! Thanks.

&gt;<i> You make a good point, but there are sound architectural reasons for the
</I>&gt;<i> big structures in this case.  GPSes have to push out a lot of fix and
</I>&gt;<i> status data, and encapsulating them in one place was important in order
</I>&gt;<i> to eliminate globals and make multiple sessions possible.
</I>
I agree. I have mine :-) What I have problem with is making them public. The
interpretation of the structure would be better not duplicated everywhere. I tend
to like callbacks: when certains documented conditions are met, call an application
provided function (for example when a new position has been received that is not
the same as before :-).

&gt;<i> You weren't the roadmap developer who bent my ear about the need of
</I>&gt;<i> non-technical users for zero administration?  Oh well...
</I>
There are not that many RoadMap developpers... Me, sometime with few other
contributors who come and go. Seems like my turnover rate is quite high 8-)
There are probably more ex-RoadMap developpers than current ones. Still,
a handful.

This being said, that cannot be me: I am somewhat afraid of a program that
scans all &quot;unused&quot; serial ports when it starts. I guess you restore the initial
port configuration (speed, stop bits, etc..). Is there any protocol that requires
sending data to the device when probing?

&gt;<i> Fair warning: in the future, the protocol may change faster than the
</I>&gt;<i> library API.  You are inviting trouble for yourself.
</I>
Hey, that's life :-) But be careful: gpsdrive seems to release even less often
than me; kismet is more active, but these guys are on PDA as well, so things
trickle down to them in undefined order :-)

What I do like with the gpsd protocol is that its all &quot;named parameters&quot; instead
of &quot;position defined parameters&quot; like NMEA. That makes compatibility check
a hell lot easier.
