<PRE>Pascal F. Martin &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">pascal.martin at cox.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> This has been a very frustrating experience, and I feel the need to
</I>&gt;<i> share it and get some advices. I expect to get somewhat burned in the
</I>&gt;<i> process :-).
</I>
The only thing I will criticize is that you didn't complain sooner so we could
fix your problems before you got so frustrated ;-).
 
&gt;<i> At first, following the recommendation from the documentation and
</I>&gt;<i> from Eric, I wrote a version that uses libgps. After some (minimal :-)
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring of RoadMap, I got a version that compiled. However it
</I>&gt;<i> never worked: the gps was always declared as not
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;online&quot;. Understanding what happens is quite difficult, since the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation reads: &quot;gpsd_query() [...] updates parts of the GPS-data
</I>&gt;<i> structure that correspond to data changed since the last call&quot;. What
</I>&gt;<i> data is changed by what response is not really obvious (at least to
</I>&gt;<i> me).
</I>
That's why there is a 'valid' flag in the structure.  The bits in that get
set whenever a field changes -- you clear them when you like, so you can
track changes at any granularity you like.  This is explained in detail 
on the libgps(3) manual page, but evidently that explanation was not good
enough.  Can you recommend a change that would documentation clarify it?

&gt;<i> Thus I looked at the gpsd web site for examples, and I found a very
</I>&gt;<i> different code: I changed my code to reflect it. It did not compile.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What happens is that I use debain &quot;testing&quot;, which provides gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> 2.13. The web site describes the latest, 2.28 (available in Debian
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;unstable&quot;). In between these two versions, the &quot;public&quot; API was
</I>&gt;<i> changed and has become incompatible with the previous versions. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> the version number should have been changed to 3.0 to reflect such a
</I>&gt;<i> major change?
</I>
I bump the major-number part of the shared-library version whenever the
API changes incompatibly.  If that isn't sufficient, I am willing to listen
to an explanation of why.

The call structure of the API has been pretty stable and is unlikely to
change often in the future.  The size and arrangement of members in the
public structures has been less stable than I would like; much of this
had to do with adding capabilities like multi-session.  I think that's 
under control now -- a last key step was turning the driver-specific storage
into a union so that adding drivers won't make the structure change size
any more (unless we get one that needs more than the 4K of storage the
Garmin driver reserves for its packet buffer).

&gt;<i> Now I am in a bind: if I use 2.28, many Debian users may be screwed
</I>&gt;<i> up (RoadMap is not yet available in Debian, so users may have to
</I>&gt;<i> recompile it). I am not too excited running after a moving target,
</I>&gt;<i> either: if the interface became incompatible once, it will likely
</I>&gt;<i> happen again.
</I>
While I can't absolutely rule that out, it is far less likely in the
future than it has been over the last year.  Multi-session and
automatic baud-rate/protocol discovery are in place now, and the
O response works.  The daemon is feature-complete.  Future development
is more likely to involve adding GPS-device drivers than anything visible
at the client-API level.

By the way, you should know that it is partly because of the pitch you made
to me at FUDCon that a lot of these changes have been happening.  I had been
moving toward automatic baud rate and protocol discovery, but your 
emphasis on zero configuration as an important feature for nontechnical
users moved it to the top of my agenda.  So some of this instability
is of your own making.  Not that that is a bad thing!

&gt;<i> Wondering what to do, I checked GpsDrive, which uses the raw NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> interface, and kismet, which decodes the gpsd protocol
</I>&gt;<i> itself. Checking some more, it appears that the protocol is in fact
</I>&gt;<i> much more stable than libgps. So far, it seems to have been compatible
</I>&gt;<i> from one version to the next.
</I>
I've gone to a lot of effort to make it that way.  But in the long term
you shouldn't count on GPSD protocol to be the stable part.   See the
remarks on the O response below.

&gt;<i> My conclusion is that the only sane solution for an application like
</I>&gt;<i> RoadMap is to follow in the footstep of giants like GpsDrive or
</I>&gt;<i> kismet. Since these applications are critical to many people,
</I>&gt;<i> introducing an incompatibility that would impact either one is less
</I>&gt;<i> likely to happen. As I did not find any significant application using
</I>&gt;<i> libgps, except for those provided with gpsd itself, I feel it is much
</I>&gt;<i> safer for me to stay away from it. In addition, this makes RoadMap
</I>&gt;<i> simpler to compile: it will not depend on gpsd libraries. The less
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies, the better.
</I>
Bad, bad idea.  It will mean there are multiple protcol decoders, rather
than just one in the libgps library itself.  

&gt;<i> OK: changing the design again, I decided I had no other choice but use the 'w' command. It is actually a lot simpler. But then RoadMap became much more unstable. This is because gpsd 2.13 does not send a consistent data set each time:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the position and the mode are not always there... Remember that this is gpsd 2.13: it is possible this has been fixed since then. But I am now obligated to handle incomplete feeds, like in NMEA.
</I>
This is why the 'W' command in more recent versions returns 'O' responses.
And that in turn is why you should not be decoding the protocol youself!

&gt;<i> BTW, I do have one question: gpsd manipulates most data as
</I>&gt;<i> double. It now performs some error estimation logic (dop()). Did
</I>&gt;<i> someone checked how much CPU this takes on an ARM, like on a PDA (the
</I>&gt;<i> ARM has no floating point hardware)?
</I>
No.  I would welcome such a benchmark.
