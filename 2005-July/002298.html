<PRE>Wolfgang S. Rupprecht:
&gt;<i> You will probably need to add some protection to gpsd to keep it from
</I>&gt;<i> collecting an ever-growing number of junk TCP connections.
</I>
You are quite right!

By coincidence, as I was mulling your mail I implemented some additional
machinery in gpsfake.py:TestSession that prints out the file descriptor
set after each test operation.  I promptly discovered that session 
closes produce a file descriptor leak!   The daemon can't tell that the 
pseudo-GPS thread produced by the test framework is gone, all it
knows is the client is not shipping commands any more.

Same situation as your Akamai proxies, essentially...

To remedy the situation the code now includes two timeout checks:  

1. If, after connecting, the client doesn't issue a command that
requests a device assignment within 60 seconds, the client is dropped,
Applications using libgps will never see this timeout, as the client
library immediately issues a 'w', which puts the session in watcher
mode and as a side effect immediately binds a device if any is available.

2. If, after device assignment, the client is not in raw mode, not in
watcher mode, and doesn't issue a command for 15 minutes, it will be
dropped.  Again, applications using libgps will never see this
timeout.

In watcher or raw mode, if the client fails to read data long enough for
the outbound socket buffers to fill, it will be dropped.

If and when I put RTCM service in the daemon, I'll keep the first
timeout (60 seconds without HELO means good-by Charlie) and treat the
RTCM session like it's in GPS raw mode -- no timeout, but if the outbound
buffers back up the client gets dropped.

Does that sound like an adequate defense?

I'll start a second thread on the DGPS policy issues.  Next response...
