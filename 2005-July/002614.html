Good catch there...

And I may need to steal that in (unsigned short)order. Kickin' at my
logs of the 50bps data I'm having a difficult time getting preamble
matches in the TLM word, leading me to believe that possibly the SS3
receivers are outputting 50bps data with the parity still all mixed
in.

&gt;<i> They're tied together is in the function rtcm_decode().  This really

</I>&gt;<i> calls unpack() afterwards when isgps_decode() is successful.  There

</I>&gt;<i> rtcm_decode() uses the frmlen field.  Ideally, PREAMBLE_TEST would
</I>&gt;<i> be written so it works for both variants and doesn't know anything
</I>&gt;<i> about struct rtcm_msg_t -- that's unpack's job.
</I>
Right, so I'll fill my 80cu. ft. scuba tank with jolt and just start
to inhale. I really hate all this bit banging. With regard to
long-term strategy, we may want to consider breaking out all this
parity stuff and message unpacking into its own &quot;library&quot;. gpsd,
dgpipd, rtcmd, navmsgd, etc. can all call into the library, and so can
any other app that just wants to use these @#(*$^@#(*$^ data formats
without having to link in the rest of gpsd. Purely for separability of
function, not because some of the code has not/less/more/very[*] scary
licenses.

[*] are you one of those damn hippie open-source weenies or one of
those damn cranio-rectally inverted IP sharks? :D

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
