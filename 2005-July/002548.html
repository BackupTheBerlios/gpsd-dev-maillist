</I>
Doing both an encoder and decoder is probably a good idea.  There are
often bugs that become very obvious when one has to look at an
interface from both sides.  Personally I'd be more tempted to go from
a C-struct format (such as your internal format) to the rtcm-sc104
format, but then I can also see the virtue of using ascii as the
interchange format.


&gt;<i> -A	38.8406	-121.3532	250	314.0	1	252	200
</I>&gt;<i> +A	38.8406	-121.3532	250	314.0	0	764	200
</I>
That dump was before the 9+3/10+2 fix.  I forgot that I needed to
crank out a new dump for you.

&gt;<i> I can't emit M lines the way you do, in-line of the output, but I have
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent debug messages.
</I>
I came to the same conclusion when I tried to put those lines in the
current gpsd code.  Having an intermediate data representation also
adds another interesting problem.  That is, what does one do to avoid
validating bad data by mistake?  

For the last few days I've been pouring over decoded rtcm diffs paying
careful attention to what happens after parity errors.  The conclusion
I came to is that this RTCM format is even nastier than I first
thought.  In a small number of cases the decoder, after losing lock,
will lock on to a false reading frame.  This is a frame that contains
100% valid data as far as the parity checks and the initial preamble
indicate.  The only clue is that data is out to lunch and the message
types emitted are often ones one is unlikely to see.

I believe the false reading frame problem is moderately important for
gpsd to solve.  If a program (like dgpsip) simply passed on the crap,
the onus would be on the gps to make sense of the damaged stream.  If
gpsd decodes the message and then re-wraps it into a valid rtcm stream
we can have the problem that total nonsense from an alternate reading
frame gets re-wrapped.  All the clues that this data may not be
correct, such as the flurry of parity errors before and after the
incorrect data would have been removed.

In order to see how bad the alternate reading frame problem is I
adding sanity checks to my code (like reference station-id changing,
zcount jumping by more than a small number of seconds or the
sequence-number not incrementing by one and only one on each message.
What I found is: 1) the coast guard xmitter will send zcounts of up to
1.8 seconds negative in the middle of the night.  2) the
sequence-number will sometimes repeat (actually the whole message is
repeated.)  I think I understand why they send the negative-jump
zcounts.  The normal correction messages are projected into the future
a bit so that the transmission delays are taken into account and the
messages are still &quot;fresh&quot; when they arrive.  The type 6 null-msg
aren't projected into the future.  Nobody cared about tardy nulls I
guess.  So even though one can't use the simplest most obvious tests
to check for validity, one still gets quite a boost by a slightly
fuzzy validation.  So far my code only prints out errors when things
look wrong.  My goal is to tie this into the decoder relocking logic
so that the bad reading frames are further discouraged.

I've also come to the conclusion that throwing the bit-lock lost
switch is an over-reaction in this protocol.  Bit slips are a heck of
a lot less likely than false reading frames.  Allowing the decoder to
start searching for a different preamble at every parity error is
causing many more problems than it solves.  It is best to just &quot;grab
the wheel tightly, grit ones teeth&quot; and ride out the error.  Only when
one gets a more parity errors than not is it a good idea to open the
floodgates and try to lock at a different position.  I've changed my
decoder to stick with the old decoding for up to a handful of parity
errors.  That approach seems to get rid of almost all the really nasty
cases where I saw the decoder emit nonsense by reading things at a
different offset.  I'm to the point where I need to start testing with
streams I've intentionally damaged to a greater degree.

It probably would be a good idea to add these or similar changes to
the mainline gpsd version of the code.  (pointer to the code below.)

&gt;<i> Your test load only includes A, H, M, N, and S messages; is there any way
</I>&gt;<i> we can collect some data that includes others like R, C, and T?
</I>
I'm hoping the USCG will eventually send one of these too.  Not sure
how we can get a copy of these from elsewhere.

&gt;<i> The process of refactoring and splint-cleaning this code has raised
</I>&gt;<i> a number of questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. How many health records can be attached to a type 5 message?  Your
</I>&gt;<i> type layout implies one only, but the documentation of Sanger's dump
</I>&gt;<i> format implies one *or more*.  Is this really possible in RTCM104, or
</I>&gt;<i> was he aggregating them from multiple messages?
</I>
The code I sent you did have a while loop to decode 0 or more
instances of the data, but the C-struct &quot;msg5&quot; didn't document that
there could be more that one piece of data.  Duplicating the last
sub-struct msg5w3 a few times wouldn't be a bad idea.

&gt;<i> 2. I note some bitfields declared signed int: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	pc1 in rtcm_msg1w3
</I>&gt;<i> 	lon_h and lat in rtcm_msg7w3
</I>&gt;<i> 	rangerate1 in rtcm_msg1w4
</I>&gt;<i> 	rangerate2 in rtcm_msg1w5
</I>&gt;<i> 	pc1 in rtcm_msg1w5
</I>&gt;<i> 	rangerate3 in rtcm_msg1w7
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do the standards specify twos-complement notation for negative values?
</I>
There are a few placed where they explicitly state two's compliment;
prc and rrc (msg1wX) are explicitly mentioned.

&gt;<i> 3. The Sanger documentation says all fields are tab-separated, but you use
</I>&gt;<i> a dump format for C (message 5) that looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;C\t%2u\t%1u  %1u\t%2u\t%1u  %1u  %1u\t%2u\n&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has embedded spaces.  What's the thinking behind that?
</I>
I just stole that printf from sager's (note spelling)
rtcm-0.3/rtcm.c line 518.

If it looks funny to you it probably needs changing in the long run,
but lets not do it right away.  It will dirty up the diffs and make
real problems harder to find.

&gt;<i> 4. The Sanger documentation says of the station health field &quot;6 means
</I>&gt;<i> the transmission is unmonitored. 7 means the station is not working
</I>&gt;<i> properly. Other values are defined by the beacon operator.&quot;  Does either
</I>&gt;<i> standard you have access to have more to say about those values?
</I>
ITU says:

     &quot;bits 8-10 

     Standard information concerning satellite navigation data
     health. For GPS three zeros indicate all data is valid, any of
     the three bits set to &quot;1&quot; indicates a problem with some or all of
     the data. For GLONASS, bit 8 set to &quot;1&quot; indicates satellite is
     unhealthy, bit 8 set to &quot;0&quot; indicates satellite is healthy; the
     second and the third bits are spares and are disregarded by the
     user equipment&quot;

RTCM says:

        (paraphrased) &quot;see table 20-VII of ICD-GPS-200&quot; this is a
        repeat of the 3 msb's of the health word of the gps ephemaris
        status words.

Grrr.  That pdf won't let me cut-and-paste.

I can send the icd pdf to you if you don't have a copy.  It is freely
redistributable as far as I can tell.  It is just not freely
cut-and-pastable. 

The reader's digest summary is the actual errors are quite technical
(and boring).  Any bit set means things aren't working at all so don't
even bother using that gps.

&gt;<i> 5. Of the health field in the A message (type 7), the Sanger
</I>&gt;<i> documentation says: &quot;has the same meaning as in the header, but it
</I>&gt;<i> indicates the health of the station for which this is an almanac.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> But while the header field is 3 bits wide, the almanac field is
</I>&gt;<i> only 2 bits wide.  I don't see how these can be the same.
</I>
That is the typo.  The field is only 2-bits wide.  the station-id is
10-bits.

&gt;<i> Looking at your comment about the 9+3 vs. 10.2, an unpleasant
</I>&gt;<i> suspicion grows on me -- maybe that difference is not just a typo.  
</I>&gt;<i> You've seen a 10+2 implementation; could Sanger have been looking
</I>&gt;<i> at a 9+3 one?
</I>
I was wondering about that, but I doubt it.  The itu spec also talks
about the 4 different encodings of the 2 health bits below the figure
containing the 3-bit health field.

from itu p.9 just under the type7 msg figure:

   *** Radiobeacon health:
                 00     (0) Radiobeacon operation normal
                 01     (1) No integrity monitor operating
                 10     (2) No information available
                 11     (3) Do not use this radiobeacon

&gt;<i> The values 6 and 7 won't fit in a 2-bit field....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the ITU and RTCM standards clash, we need to have detection logic to tell
</I>&gt;<i> us which one we're looking at.  This can't be a compile-time option if there
</I>&gt;<i> are both kinds of transmitters in the world.
</I>
We probably need to get Sager or someone in europe involved to give us
some test samples from there. 

&gt;<i> 6. The code for handling unknown messages 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /* msg unknown */
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> struct rtcm_msgunk {
</I>&gt;<i>     struct rtcm_msghw1   w1;
</I>&gt;<i>     struct rtcm_msghw2   w2;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     uint            w3;
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     default:
</I>&gt;<i> 	{
</I>&gt;<i> 	    struct msgunk    *m = (struct msgunk *) msghdr;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	    printf (&quot;U\t*** Unknown msg type! (len %d) ***\n&quot;, len);
</I>&gt;<i> 	    while (len &gt;= 1){
</I>&gt;<i> 		printf (&quot;U\t0x%08x\n&quot;, m-&gt;w3);
</I>&gt;<i> 		len--;
</I>&gt;<i> 		m = (struct msgunk *) (((RTCMWORD *) m) + 1);
</I>&gt;<i> 	    }
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i> 	break;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't look quite right to me.  This looks like at each step m is
</I>&gt;<i> going to point at an entire rtcm_msgunk.  Shouldn't it just be 
</I>&gt;<i> pointing at an RTCMWORD?
</I>
I guess the code isn't as clear as it could be.  I tried to mimic the
other code which also uses that style of bumping the outer-struct
pointer even though technically, it no longer points to a struct of
that type then.

m points to the header before the first bumping, but the extracted and
printed value is m-&gt;w3 which is the int located in the word-3 position
counting in the itu / rtcm way by starting at word-1.

&gt;<i> 7.  What is an &quot;LF transmitter&quot;, and how does it differ from a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;GPS reference receiver&quot;?  This is a term of art that our
</I>&gt;<i> rtcm(5) page should explain.
</I>
LF transmitter == low frequency transmitter.  The unit that transmits
the approximately 300khz radio signal that the differential radio
receiver picks up.

GPS reference receiver == a survey grade gps that does GPS carrier
tracking and can work out its own position to a few millimeters.  This
unit is what generates the range and range-rate corrections and
encodes them into rtcm.  This rtcm signal is then sent to the LF
transmitter as a conventional serial rs-232 signal at 100 baud or 200
baud depending on the requirements of the transmitter.

Transmitters that are meant to have a higher range will need to
transmit at the slower rate.  The higher the data rate the harder it
will be for the remote radio receiver to receive with a good
signal-to-noise ration.  (Higher data rate signals can't be averaged
over as long a time frame, hence they appear noisier.)

&gt;<i> 8.  How does one read the IOD field in satellite corrections?  Is it a just
</I>&gt;<i> a sequence number?
</I>
It is more important than just a sequence number.  It is a tag for the
ephemaris used to work out and describe the GPS satellite's orbit.  It
is vital that the GPS using the DGPS correction and the DGPS
generating the data use the same orbital positions for the satellite.
It doesn't even matter that much if they both use slightly old data as
long as the use the same old data.

&gt;<i> 9. In the C message, what does the word &quot;soon&quot; associated with the new_data
</I>&gt;<i> field mean?  Can we pin that down to a number of seconds?
</I>
Dunno.  I can't see anything in icd200c about IOD changes, so perhaps
its a reference station invented bit that means it sees new data but
is still using the old data for the next few instants.

&gt;<i> 10. How much work would it take to implement the &quot;useful length&quot; report
</I>&gt;<i> and Sanger's T suffix?  Is the decoder logic actually already collecting this
</I>&gt;<i> information
</I>
I have it, but did it a bit differently.  I added a &quot;P&quot; flag just
after the initial letter to indicate a parity error mashed some data
somewhere on this line.  That destroys less information.

It requires adding quite a bit of hair to allow the decoder to use bad
data but carefully mark it as bad and keep track of what parts are
bad.  This is what I'm playing with now:

        <A HREF="http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/private/rtcmencode.tar.gz">http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/private/rtcmencode.tar.gz</A>

I haven't decided if its too complicated for the gains or if it is
worth the added hair.
