<PRE>I've been away for a while, and had been using 2.21 fine with this  
GPS, in NMEA mode (even though it's a SiRF II unit).  For some  
reason, ~July 3rd, the list server turned off e-mails for both gpsd  
lists I subscribed to.

The GlobalSat BT-318 is a Bluetooth SiRF II based GPS.  gpsd has  
NEVER been able to change it to SiRF mode or recognize it as a SiRF  
GPS.  It has worked OK in NMEA mode.  With 2.26 &amp; 2.28, gpsd has  
trouble syncing with the GPS, and spits out odd output.  KisMAC does  
not get good data from gpsd.

Attached is a gzip'd tar file, with two (2) output files.   
'gpsd-6.output' is the output of gpsd, running with a debug level of  
6.  'cat.output' is the output of 'cat /dev/cu.gps &gt; cat.output'.  If  
there's anything else I can provide/do to help troubleshoot this,  
please let me know.

ps.  I am interested in this GPS working in SiRF mode.  I can use the  
Windows based SiRF utility to put the GPS in SiRF mode, and then gpsd  
will see it as a SiRF GPS.  If someone is willing to take a serious  
look at the GPS, I'm willing to loan it and a Bluetooth adapter.  If  
anyone has any ideas or want's to look at the unit, please let me  
know.  Below is my original report of this GPS working with gpsd:

---------------------------------------------------
GPS:
GlobalSat BT-318 Bluetooth GPS:
     <A HREF="http://www.globalsat.com.tw/english/products_detail.php?">http://www.globalsat.com.tw/english/products_detail.php?</A>
main_id=21&amp;p_id=107
Uses Bluetooth Serial Protocol
GPS Protocol (from box):
     Default:  NMEA 0183 (Secondary:  SiRF binary)
     NMEA-0183 v2.2
GPS Output format:
     GGA(1sec), GSA(1sec), GSV(5sec), RMC(1sec), VTG(1sec)
Chipset - Sirf Star II/LP

Software tested with:
gpsd v2.21
Palm Pilot Leadtek GPS utility works EVERY time, as NMEA, SiRF &amp; at
varying communication speeds......

Quick Review/Description:
Quick fix times (experience)
  From box:
     Hot        8 Sec. Avg.
     Warm    38 Sec. Avg.
     Cold        45 Sec. Avg.
     Re-aquire    .1 Sec. Avg.
Bluetooth range is AWSOME!  Box claims 80M!!!!  I've experienced 30'+,
with a Belkin 100M range Bluetooth adapter.
Comes with Car charger, Home charger, 1650mAh Liion battery, mini CD
with drivers &amp; NO software.  $159.99 from Semsons.com.
It has a magnetic mount, but is NOT waterproof.  It has a built in
active antenna &amp; external MMCX antenna connector.  The power button is
a slider switch.  It can be used without the battery.  There are three
(3) LED's - Power, Bluetooth connection &amp; GPS Fix.  The charging jack
looks like an iPaq charging plug.  The battery life is a claimed 15
hours, in continuous mode, and &gt;20 hours in trickle mode.
Dimensions:  89mm x 52mm x 30mm
