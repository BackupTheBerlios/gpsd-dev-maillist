Yo Rob!

This is probably off topic to gpsd-dev, so let's do the followups offlist.

Nope, solid as a rock.  Sure the journaling has a price, but if the system
crashes then the reboot is almost as quick as a clean boot.  Sure beats
having the phone ring for an hour while the system fscks.

&gt;<i> I have been using Reiserfs since SuSE suggested it as a default FS (8.0?
</I>&gt;<i> 7.3?  for several years anyway...)
</I>
Never used SuSE, just touched it a few times.  Now that they are now Novell
I probably never will.

&gt;<i> I never lost a filesystem, but then I never lost an ext2 either.  My

</I>
Yep, ext3 is also good, just that when you read a large directory it can
really bog.  I am not doing video to disk and that is the application most
sensitive to disk latency.  So you may see some issues I do not.  I never
bother with tweaks like noatime anymore.

&gt;<i> However, what I have found on many systems that I installed using Reiserfs
</I>&gt;<i> is that writing a lot of data (e.g. copying one disk to another) results
</I>&gt;<i> in too much memory being claimed for buffers, even to the point where

</I>&gt;<i> busy because of the copying, the additional swap I/O makes the system very
</I>&gt;<i> slow.
</I>
I never let my systems swap either.  But my answer is just more RAM.  1GB
is pretty cheap these days.

&gt;<i> On my home system, where I run gpsd, this seemed to trigger a problem in
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.  But at work I have also noticed that systems become very sluggish
</I>&gt;<i> during a big rsync, for example.  Bash inputline echo on a console can
</I>&gt;<i> take seconds...
</I>
I try to never let a system get that slow.  What sort of load factor
would that be?
