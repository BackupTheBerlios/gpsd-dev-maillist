Ah, yes. That would be my assumption. For now, SiRF receivers are
seeming like the gps hacker's choice. Though there are a number of
other interesting platforms out there that I haven't got around to
blowing money on...

analog devices -&gt; SST-NAV-2500
motorola -&gt; oncore
navsync -&gt; CW25 (looks a bit like SiRF)
novatel -&gt; superstar2
rf microdevices -&gt; rf8900xemix -&gt; XE1610
rockwell -&gt; jupiter, zodiac
signav -&gt; mg5000
sony -&gt; CXD2951 gps chipset
trimble -&gt; lassen *
ublox/atmel -&gt; antaris
u-nav microelectronics -&gt; uN901
zarlink (mitel) -&gt; GP4020 (orion)

fastrax (www.fastrax.fi) uses the sony chipset in their uPatch
products, and they have the command specs available for download. the
command spec also includes hints on decoding ICD-GPS-200 data
(<A HREF="http://www.fastrax.fi/showfile.cfm?guid=e6a0ea2c-2ff6-4f15-bffa-de0104322c48">http://www.fastrax.fi/showfile.cfm?guid=e6a0ea2c-2ff6-4f15-bffa-de0104322c48</A>)

&gt;<i> However, the device in question is a Garmin. I know how to flash the
</I>&gt;<i> GPS in that evil OS, although I've never done it.
</I>
I have no garmin any more, and the last firmware update for my etrex
was released ages ago. Plus, garmin wasn't very cooperative at all
about giving me the documentation I asked for, so they can get
stuffed. Note that in my list of platforms i'm interested in hacking
on, garmin does not appear.

&gt;<i> I probably won't do
</I>&gt;<i> that, but because of an improved WAAS subsystem, I think the accuracy
</I>&gt;<i> bonus is worth something, but surely not worth killing my GPS, the SO
</I>&gt;<i> would be _very_angry_ at me.
</I>
Possibly with the official Garmin tools you'd be safer. One would hope
that they have semi-infinite supplies of test hardware and would take
at least a few minutes to see that their flasher has a non-zero chance
of working.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
