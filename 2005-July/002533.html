There was no problem with autoconfiguration for me.  It was set to OFF
automatically.
However, it still compiled that program.  Even when DBUS was OFF.
So it was probably something else that went wrong.


Note that it is quite common for some library to be present but the
headerfile not to be available.  This can happen for any library.
In SuSE Linux, and probably also in others, most packages are split in at
least two components:
- the base package that contains the shared library and possible programs
required for users.
- the development package that contains the headerfiles and other
resources only required for developers.

Normally only the base package is installed when certain subsystems are
installed (i.e. some package being installed requires the library) but the
development package is only installed when explicitly marked by the user
in the package installation program.

So if you want to check for the availability of a feature like dbus you
must also do a test compilation that uses the headerfile.
(at least this is how they check the other libraries and headers in autoconf)

On my system, both the header and library for dbus are not present.
