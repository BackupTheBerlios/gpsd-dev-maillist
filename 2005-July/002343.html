Did you never notice the problems during lots of writing?
I have been using Reiserfs since SuSE suggested it as a default FS (8.0?
7.3?  for several years anyway...)
I never lost a filesystem, but then I never lost an ext2 either.  My
digital video recorder uses ext3 and I have had to fsck it to get it OK
again, but did not lose data...

However, what I have found on many systems that I installed using Reiserfs
is that writing a lot of data (e.g. copying one disk to another) results
in too much memory being claimed for buffers, even to the point where
running programs are written to the swapspace.  As the disk is already
busy because of the copying, the additional swap I/O makes the system very
slow.

On my home system, where I run gpsd, this seemed to trigger a problem in
gpsd.  But at work I have also noticed that systems become very sluggish
during a big rsync, for example.  Bash inputline echo on a console can
take seconds...
