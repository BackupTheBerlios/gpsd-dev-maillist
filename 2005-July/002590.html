<PRE>The project is in fine shape.  But our repository is a mess.
Anonymous SVN access at Berlios has been down for days now and there
is no telling when it will be back up.  This has two consequences:

1) I'm feeling some urgency to ship a point release.

2) I'm considering moving us to a different hosting site.

Unfortunately, large stable project-hosting sites offering Subversion 
and other than Berlios don't seem to exist yet.  I'm still looking.
Meanwhile, the anonymous-access-down bug has been reported at least
twice on the site buglist.  I can't imagine it's been totally ignored.

Otherwise the summer doldrums seem to have set in.  We've had one 
minor bug report, a core-dump while using a TSIP GPS and processing
DGPS corrections; I think that's fixed.  It's the main reason I'n
thinking about pushing out a point release.  

Otherwise development was moving slowly even before the repo
troubles.  Petr Slansky continues to work on the EverMore driver.
Oleg Gusev may still be working on the iTrax/iTalk driver but he
hasn't been heard from in a while.  Oleg, if you're listening: what's
your status?

Wolfgang Rupprecht and I have been separately hacking RTCM drivers.
His improved sync locking was due to be merged into the GPSD version
when the repo troubles intervened.  Meanwhile. I've been cleaning
up the code and removing casts and other grottiness.  I've also
written most of a repack() function that should enable the decoder
to act as an encoder as well.

gpsflash is stalled until SiRF clarifies under what terms it will
allow us to distribute a loader binary.

Finally, I've added a &quot;Goals and Philosophy&quot; section to the Hacking
Guide.  Senior developers, if you think it needs correction or
elaboration, tell me.
