<PRE>I have succeeded in breaking the RTCM code into upper and lower layers.
The packet assembler now lives in isgps.c, and should in theory be
reusable for decoding 50BPS subframe data as well as RTCM-104 data.

It is possible that the interface between the upper and lower layers
could be simpler.  At the moment it requires two functional hooks.
One checks for the preamble pattern, and the other to see if an RTCM
pattern is as long as the frame length in the header says it ought to
be.

I am fairly sure that the preamble is at the same location in both 
subframe and RTCM packets, but my attempts to write a test for it that 
doesn't depend on the RTCM bitfields have failed.  Wolfgang, if it's
possible to write a common test that just uses bit shift and mask
operations, we could get rid of at least one functional hook.

The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any
member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm
to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient
warrant.	-- John Stuart Mill, &quot;On Liberty&quot;, 1859
