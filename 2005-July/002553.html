</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sorely tempted to write re-packing code that will go from Sanger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dump format to RTCM104, just so nobody will ever gave to deal with this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crap at bit-level again. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doing both an encoder and decoder is probably a good idea.  There are
</I>&gt;<i> often bugs that become very obvious when one has to look at an
</I>&gt;<i> interface from both sides.  Personally I'd be more tempted to go from
</I>&gt;<i> a C-struct format (such as your internal format) to the rtcm-sc104
</I>&gt;<i> format, but then I can also see the virtue of using ascii as the
</I>&gt;<i> interchange format.
</I>
Oh, obviously the right thing is struct to RTCM104.  That way we 
decouple the repacking code from the dump format.  It becomes a very
well-defined problem -- write the inverse of rtcm.c:pack().

&gt;<i> &gt; -A	38.8406	-121.3532	250	314.0	1	252	200
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +A	38.8406	-121.3532	250	314.0	0	764	200
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That dump was before the 9+3/10+2 fix.  I forgot that I needed to
</I>&gt;<i> crank out a new dump for you.
</I>
Please do.
 
&gt;<i> I believe the false reading frame problem is moderately important for
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd to solve.  If a program (like dgpsip) simply passed on the crap,
</I>&gt;<i> the onus would be on the gps to make sense of the damaged stream.  If
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd decodes the message and then re-wraps it into a valid rtcm stream
</I>&gt;<i> we can have the problem that total nonsense from an alternate reading
</I>&gt;<i> frame gets re-wrapped.  All the clues that this data may not be
</I>&gt;<i> correct, such as the flurry of parity errors before and after the
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect data would have been removed.
</I>
I saw this possibility.  Which is why I do *not* intend to use
re-packing in gpsd itself.  The logic I'm working on will decode the
RTCM104 for purposes of reporting data to clients that want to see
Sager dump format or some logical equivalent, but will pass nearly raw
data (perhaps with skips due to bad word tags removed, but no other
editing) to GPSes.
 
&gt;<i> It probably would be a good idea to add these or similar changes to
</I>&gt;<i> the mainline gpsd version of the code.  (pointer to the code below.)
</I>
I greatly fear trying to merge these myself.  Can you send patches
against svn head?  Can you build svn head yet? (If not, I'll give top
priority to fixing that.)  I really think we need to be working on the
same code and using the same set of regression tests.  Otherwise
madness will suely ensue...
 
&gt;<i> &gt; 1. How many health records can be attached to a type 5 message?  Your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type layout implies one only, but the documentation of Sanger's dump
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; format implies one *or more*.  Is this really possible in RTCM104, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was he aggregating them from multiple messages?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code I sent you did have a while loop to decode 0 or more
</I>&gt;<i> instances of the data, but the C-struct &quot;msg5&quot; didn't document that
</I>&gt;<i> there could be more that one piece of data.  Duplicating the last
</I>&gt;<i> sub-struct msg5w3 a few times wouldn't be a bad idea.
</I>
I'll do that.  Do you know what the maximum possible number of health
messages is is under the standard, or can you find out?  That's what I
nead to set the value of MAXHEALTH.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2. I note some bitfields declared signed int: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	pc1 in rtcm_msg1w3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	lon_h and lat in rtcm_msg7w3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	rangerate1 in rtcm_msg1w4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	rangerate2 in rtcm_msg1w5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	pc1 in rtcm_msg1w5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	rangerate3 in rtcm_msg1w7
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do the standards specify twos-complement notation for negative values?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few placed where they explicitly state two's compliment;
</I>&gt;<i> prc and rrc (msg1wX) are explicitly mentioned.
</I>
I'll add a comment about this.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; 3. The Sanger documentation says all fields are tab-separated, but you use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a dump format for C (message 5) that looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &quot;C\t%2u\t%1u  %1u\t%2u\t%1u  %1u  %1u\t%2u\n&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It has embedded spaces.  What's the thinking behind that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just stole that printf from sager's (note spelling)
</I>&gt;<i> rtcm-0.3/rtcm.c line 518.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it looks funny to you it probably needs changing in the long run,
</I>&gt;<i> but lets not do it right away.  It will dirty up the diffs and make
</I>&gt;<i> real problems harder to find.
</I>
Good point.  I'll add a FIXME comment.

&gt;<i> I can send the icd pdf to you if you don't have a copy.  It is freely
</I>&gt;<i> redistributable as far as I can tell.  It is just not freely
</I>&gt;<i> cut-and-pastable. 
</I>
Please do.
 
&gt;<i> The reader's digest summary is the actual errors are quite technical
</I>&gt;<i> (and boring).  Any bit set means things aren't working at all so don't
</I>&gt;<i> even bother using that gps.
</I>
I'll say this on the manual page.

&gt;<i> &gt; 5. Of the health field in the A message (type 7), the Sanger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; documentation says: &quot;has the same meaning as in the header, but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indicates the health of the station for which this is an almanac.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But while the header field is 3 bits wide, the almanac field is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only 2 bits wide.  I don't see how these can be the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is the typo.  The field is only 2-bits wide.  the station-id is
</I>&gt;<i> 10-bits.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Looking at your comment about the 9+3 vs. 10.2, an unpleasant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suspicion grows on me -- maybe that difference is not just a typo.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You've seen a 10+2 implementation; could Sanger have been looking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at a 9+3 one?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering about that, but I doubt it.  The itu spec also talks
</I>&gt;<i> about the 4 different encodings of the 2 health bits below the figure
</I>&gt;<i> containing the 3-bit health field.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> from itu p.9 just under the type7 msg figure:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    *** Radiobeacon health:
</I>&gt;<i>                  00     (0) Radiobeacon operation normal
</I>&gt;<i>                  01     (1) No integrity monitor operating
</I>&gt;<i>                  10     (2) No information available
</I>&gt;<i>                  11     (3) Do not use this radiobeacon
</I>
On the other hand, Sager said this field has the same values as the three-bit
field in the header.  That's why I suspect he must actually have been looking
at a 9+3 implementation.  Or somehow thought he was.

The screwy part about that is that I'd expect the RTCM standard (9+3) to
hold in the U.S. and ITU (10+2) in Europe.  But you're seeing 10+2 from 
a USCG station.

I've added text to the rtcm(5) manual page decribing the conflict between the
standards.  All it says now for either field is that a nonzero value
is bad.

&gt;<i> We probably need to get Sager or someone in europe involved to give us
</I>&gt;<i> some test samples from there. 
</I>
We can get those easily enough from the EUREF server.  The issue is
whether there really are 9+3 implementations in the world and, if so,
whether we can detect them by other features of the data stream.
 
&gt;<i> m points to the header before the first bumping, but the extracted and
</I>&gt;<i> printed value is m-&gt;w3 which is the int located in the word-3 position
</I>&gt;<i> counting in the itu / rtcm way by starting at word-1.
</I>
Ugh.  Please patch this in svn head to make it a little clearer.  Or
add a comment, at least.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; 7.  What is an &quot;LF transmitter&quot;, and how does it differ from a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;GPS reference receiver&quot;?  This is a term of art that our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rtcm(5) page should explain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> LF transmitter == low frequency transmitter.  The unit that transmits
</I>&gt;<i> the approximately 300khz radio signal that the differential radio
</I>&gt;<i> receiver picks up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GPS reference receiver == a survey grade gps that does GPS carrier
</I>&gt;<i> tracking and can work out its own position to a few millimeters.  This
</I>&gt;<i> unit is what generates the range and range-rate corrections and
</I>&gt;<i> encodes them into rtcm.  This rtcm signal is then sent to the LF
</I>&gt;<i> transmitter as a conventional serial rs-232 signal at 100 baud or 200
</I>&gt;<i> baud depending on the requirements of the transmitter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Transmitters that are meant to have a higher range will need to
</I>&gt;<i> transmit at the slower rate.  The higher the data rate the harder it
</I>&gt;<i> will be for the remote radio receiver to receive with a good
</I>&gt;<i> signal-to-noise ration.  (Higher data rate signals can't be averaged
</I>&gt;<i> over as long a time frame, hence they appear noisier.)
</I>
Thanks, I'll merge this in to the RTCM manual page.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; 8.  How does one read the IOD field in satellite corrections?  Is it a just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a sequence number?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is more important than just a sequence number.  It is a tag for the
</I>&gt;<i> ephemaris used to work out and describe the GPS satellite's orbit.  It
</I>&gt;<i> is vital that the GPS using the DGPS correction and the DGPS
</I>&gt;<i> generating the data use the same orbital positions for the satellite.
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't even matter that much if they both use slightly old data as
</I>&gt;<i> long as the use the same old data.
</I>
Merged on to to the manual page.

&gt;<i> &gt; 9. In the C message, what does the word &quot;soon&quot; associated with the new_data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field mean?  Can we pin that down to a number of seconds?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dunno.  I can't see anything in icd200c about IOD changes, so perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> its a reference station invented bit that means it sees new data but
</I>&gt;<i> is still using the old data for the next few instants.
</I>
I won't try to clarify this, then.

&gt;<i> &gt; 10. How much work would it take to implement the &quot;useful length&quot; report
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and Sanger's T suffix?  Is the decoder logic actually already collecting this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have it, but did it a bit differently.  I added a &quot;P&quot; flag just
</I>&gt;<i> after the initial letter to indicate a parity error mashed some data
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere on this line.  That destroys less information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It requires adding quite a bit of hair to allow the decoder to use bad
</I>&gt;<i> data but carefully mark it as bad and keep track of what parts are
</I>&gt;<i> bad.  This is what I'm playing with now:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         <A HREF="http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/private/rtcmencode.tar.gz">http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/private/rtcmencode.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't decided if its too complicated for the gains or if it is
</I>&gt;<i> worth the added hair.
</I>
I won't try to to document this until you merge your changes into
the gpsd main line.
