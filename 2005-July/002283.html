Just some random observations from running a dgpsip server for a
while.

There are a surprising number of folks that connect up to it with a
web browser.  (I won't reinforce stereotypes by mentioning the browser
id-strings for the folks doing this, but they all have the word
&quot;compatible&quot; in them.  Oops, just did. ;-)) The problem for the server
is that the browsers don't generally disconnect until the server drops
them.

There are some broken web proxies (like akamai) that also connect for
weeks at a time.  Perhaps this is related to a browser initiating the
connect from above.

The first line of defense I added to the server was to detect an http
connect and send an http redirect to the dgpsip web page.  Note, some
browsers also need to have the tcp connection closed before they go
away.  The redirect itself isn't enough.

The second line of defense (added just recently) was to
unceremoniously drop any connection that doesn't issue a &quot;HELO ...&quot;
string within 60 seconds.

You will probably need to add some protection to gpsd to keep it from
collecting an ever-growing number of junk TCP connections.

There was also a (failed) share and share alike political angle for me
not releasing a multi-user server.  By only releasing a single-user
server I was hoping to force folks to let me redistribute the signal
from here.  That would prevent them from only serving paying customers
etc.  Back in the days when I wrote the server there was a thriving
business in selling differential corrections over FM (and perhaps
other RF means).  Those companies all died rather quickly when
selective-availability went away.  Some people speculated at the time
that the reason selective availability went way with less than 24hrs
notice was that the military planners were afraid that the for-pay
differential corrections companies would lobby their tame senators and
try to perpetuate SA.

Well, in any case there was never a ground-swell of folks offering
dgpsip feeds.  I'd hoped that eventually the CORS umbrella group (or
the Coast Guard) would give me a feed, but that never happened.

     <A HREF="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/cors-data.html">http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/cors-data.html</A>

Someone with more political, people-hacking savvy might want to try
their hand at springing some feeds from them.

&gt;<i> Hm.  The SiRF engineer I've been talking with tells me the UERE
</I>&gt;<i> estimate he gives customers for a non-DGPS fix is 8 meters, while the
</I>&gt;<i> DGPS UERE is 2 meters.  That sounds like a difference worth chasing.
</I>&gt;<i> Is he being...er...optimistic about the capability of the hardware?
</I>
Those numbers sound about right for the 95% figure.  I'm very bad at
picturing what 95% looks like and much prefer to think of the 50%
level.  I can easily picture a 4.5 meter circle with half the marbles
inside it and half outside.

In any case, the 2 meter number almost certainly is for a differential
reference station that is located very close to the GPS in question.
The whole differential hack assumes that the paths and angles between
the reference station and the mobile GPS unit are similar enough that
one can simply subtract the path-length errors the reference station
is seeing from the path the mobile GPS had calculated.  If the angles
to the satellite are vastly different (as in the case of dgpsip from
across the country) one can start adding errors.  In the days of SA
the largest component of error was due to SA, so miscorrecting the
paths hardly mattered at all.  Even cross-country dgpsip was
worthwhile and improved accuracy.  I doubt that one would see any that
2meter accuracy if one were more than a 100 miles away.

Just for completeness, there are other issues too, like different
ionospheric and tropospheric pierce points for the rays going to the
reference and mobile units.  The speed of light is slightly lowered by
going through the atmosphere.  The amount it slows down is enough to
add a few meters (very roughly, up to 15 meters) of path-length error.
The ionosphere and troposphere aren't a constant height.  They are
substantially pumped up by sunlight, so taking a reading from one
location in heavy sun and applying it to a distant area with a lower
sun angle could make things quite a bit worse.  (There may also be
roughness associated with the layer thickness that defies modeling
with a simple sun-angle model.  I don't know enough about that sort of
thing.)

In summary, while I have no problem believing the SiRF engineer that
you can get 2 meters accuracy from their chips when using a very close
reference, I fear that the average user will be getting the same 8m or
worse accuracy by using dgpsip.
