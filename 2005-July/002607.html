berlios fscking-up again?

&gt;<i> The GlobalSat BT-318 is a Bluetooth SiRF II based GPS.  gpsd has

I don't even see any evidence of a SiRF probe happening. Can you try a

Well, the NMEA looks bog-standard.

from the gpsd log
&quot;$PSRFTXT,nmeaErrorHandler: Transport Data Error&quot;
never seen that before...

&gt;<i> ps.  I am interested in this GPS working in SiRF mode.  I can use the

Heh, lucky me for reading a bunch of the SiRF gps boards.

First off, I'd say this is a bluetooth problem: apparently the
bluetooth serial port profile has problems switching both speed and
protocol. I seem to recall seeing two conflicting workarounds: just
switch to SiRF mode at the same speed, or try kick it over to 38400 to
start. I just rebuilt my firefox and cleaned my cache, so I don't
remember which website I saw that on.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
