When the TSIP initializer is called because the packet handler believes it
has recognized a Trimble receiver, it has to set ODD parity before it can
send commands to the receiver.  And it wants to send commands to set the
receiver to report reasonable packet types and to poll it to send certain
reports that are not sent on a timed basis.
The receiver will ignore those commands when they are not sent with odd
parity.

This is why I believe it is good to try to receive 2 or 3 packets before
deciding a receiver is of a certain type.  This is the job of the packet
getter, not of tsip.c.  Or do you think I should remove the initializer
and incorporate some code in the received packet parser that calls this
function after 3 received packets??

As the code is now (and has been as long as I have been hacking drivers)
the first packet received is junked somewhere before the parser is called.
 This can be seen in the debug output.
Adding the check for a second packet before calling the initializer would
not increase the delay at all.
(finding this bug, which must be somewhere in packet.c I think, could
decrease the delay but apparently nobody has considered this to be
worthwile yet)
