If RTCM and subframes turn out to use compatible message structs,
shouldn't we just add the subframe to the mama-of-a-union that
describes the rtcm messages?  I really worry about describing the
preamble in terms that don't derive from the struct definition.  It
means typo's can be introduced that the compiler can't catch for us.
It also makes both-endian code harder to maintain since the shifts are
different.

I have some big-endian code working on a sparc-64/obsd.  That should
be a worst case test.  Being a lazy git, I wrote a hack perl script to
invert each of the bitfields in the struct and generate a big-endian
version of the RTCM structs.  The upside is absolutely no increase in
run-time cost.  The downside is either two hand maintained sets of
structs that must track, or a perl script to generate the BE version
of the structs.

I couldn't bring myself to even think of doing run-time bit-shifting.
Another problem was I didn't understand your bitreverse() function.
The &quot;value&quot; term was never introduced (typo / same variable as the
&quot;unsinged x&quot; input parameter???)  The best I could make out it
inverted each bit in the bitfield.  Thats not right, so I probably
didn't understand the intention of the code correctly.  (A
bit-inversion within the bitfields isn't the inversion thats wanted.
The most-significant-bits still are at &lt;&lt; that end of the big-endian
register.  We need to flip the bitfield locations within the 32-bit
words, but keep the order of the bits within the bitfields the same.)

If that approach is ok with you I'll fold it into the current svn and
send you diffs.  I still owe you diffs for the decoder armoring in the
face of parity errors.  I haven't forgotten.
