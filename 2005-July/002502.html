<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is why I believe it is good to try to receive 2 or 3 packets before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deciding a receiver is of a certain type.  This is the job of the packet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getter, not of tsip.c.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not necessary, as it turns out.  The reason the Evermore and TSIP drivers
</I>&gt;<i> were contending in that the Evermore checxksum wasn't being checked --
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> was due to a typo of mine that Petr caught yesterday.
</I>
I find it hard to believe that it will improve things...

The problem we had was that an Evermore packet was recognized as a TSIP
packet (which could happen when reading starts at the second DLE of a
doubled-DLE halfway a packet) and the daemon switched to TSIP mode,

As TSIP has no checksum and very little checks that can be done by the
state machine, this kind of misdetection can only be resolved by the
driver (which could indicate the parsed packet is not valid, but currently
has no way of telling that to the caller) or by making sure that at least
one packet was scanned from the starting DLE (by reading 2 packets before
deciding what mode the driver will switch to).
I prefer the second method, because otherwise any action performed by the
initializer function has to be undone as well.
