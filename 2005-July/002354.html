<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; I've committed a first cut at Evermore binary support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not going to work this way, because the Evermore protocol is very
</I>&gt;<i> similar to the TSIP protocol at framing level.  The state machine will not
</I>&gt;<i> be able to tell them apart this way, unless you only support one of them
</I>&gt;<i> at a time.
</I>
Yeowch!  Good point!
 
&gt;<i> Maybe you should have a look at the TSIP driver and state machine for
</I>&gt;<i> (imo) a bit cleaner DLE-stuffing handling.  The Evermore people document
</I>&gt;<i> things in a very unclear way, but the framing is really just based on
</I>&gt;<i> DLE-STX data DLE-ETX where DLE in the data is doubled.  The length field
</I>&gt;<i> is just part of the data, and stuffed like any data field.  Same for the
</I>&gt;<i> checksum.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After reading a DLE you could tell TSIP and Evermore apart by the 02 byte
</I>&gt;<i> which never occurs immediately after DLE in TSIP (the byte after the
</I>&gt;<i> initial DLE is always 0x13 or above).
</I>
I've committed a change that does this.  I contemplated trying to merge 
the TSIP and Evermore parts of the state machines more aggressively, but
I think it's better to keep them separate so work on the Evermore logic
won't break the TSIP stuff.  

So at the moment all they share is the DLE_LEADER state, with a dispatch on
the second character as you suggested.
 
&gt;<i> Try to make the state machine as strict as possible.  Protocols like this
</I>&gt;<i> are easily misdetected when the baudrate is wrong, as a 0x10 byte is quite
</I>&gt;<i> likely to come in (I had many misdetection problems while developing the
</I>&gt;<i> TSIP driver)
</I>
This is why I check checksums in the packet_get() code.  That test seems
very unlikely to give a false positive on garbage.
