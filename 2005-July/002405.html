<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I just checked in SourceForge CVS a version of RoadMap that supports the gpsd native protocol. The user will be able to select either the NMEA raw interface or this native support.

This has been a very frustrating experience, and I feel the need to share it and get some advices. I expect to get somewhat burned in the process :-).

At first, following the recommendation from the documentation and from Eric, I wrote a version that uses libgps. After some (minimal :-) refactoring of RoadMap, I got a version that compiled. However it never worked: the gps was always declared as not &quot;online&quot;. Understanding what happens is quite difficult, since the documentation reads: &quot;gpsd_query() [...] updates  parts  of the GPS-data structure that correspond to data changed since the last call&quot;. What data is changed by what response is not really obvious (at least to me).

Thus I looked at the gpsd web site for examples, and I found a very different code: I changed my code to reflect it. It did not compile.

What happens is that I use debain &quot;testing&quot;, which provides gpsd 2.13. The web site describes the latest, 2.28 (available in Debian &quot;unstable&quot;). In between these two versions, the &quot;public&quot; API was changed and has become incompatible with the previous versions. Maybe the version number should have been changed to 3.0 to reflect such a major change?

Now I am in a bind: if I use 2.28, many Debian users may be screwed up (RoadMap is not yet available in Debian, so users may have to recompile it). I am not too excited running after a moving target, either: if the interface became incompatible once, it will likely happen again.

Wondering what to do, I checked GpsDrive, which uses the raw NMEA interface, and kismet, which decodes the gpsd protocol itself. Checking some more, it appears that the protocol is in fact much more stable than libgps. So far, it seems to have been compatible from one version to the next.

My conclusion is that the only sane solution for an application like RoadMap is to follow in the footstep of giants like GpsDrive or kismet. Since these applications are critical to many people, introducing an incompatibility that would impact either one is less likely to happen. As I did not find any significant application using libgps, except for those provided with gpsd itself, I feel it is much safer for me to stay away from it. In addition, this makes RoadMap simpler to compile: it will not depend on gpsd libraries. The less dependencies, the better.


Thus the second gpsd native protocol in RoadMap: writing my own protocol decoder. After some more refactoring of RoadMap, it ends being relatively simple, since it shares a lot with NMEA: a stream of ASCII lines.

As I prefer to get all what I want at once each time, I chose to query gpsd periodically. The decoding is however asynchronous (I cannot afford to block on gpsd: this is a GUI application that must respond when the user interacts). I got some very weird behavior (car jumping from street to street). It took me some time to find out that this was because I replay using gpsfake at 10 times the speed: with a periodic request I miss 9 out of 10 cycles.

OK: changing the design again, I decided I had no other choice but use the 'w' command. It is actually a lot simpler. But then RoadMap became much more unstable. This is because gpsd 2.13 does not send a consistent data set each time:

GPSD,P=33.811350 -118.351417,D=2005-07-11T23:04:05Z
GPSD,P=33.811350 -118.351417,D=2002-10-26T23:04:07Z,T=91.800000,V=0.000000,S=1,M=2

GPSD,P=33.811350 -118.351433,D=2005-07-11T23:04:09Z,A=30.600000,S=1,M=2
GPSD,Q=4 7.300000 3.100000 6.600000,M=3
GPSD,Y=8:7 44 197 46 1:8 67 65 48 1:11 18 88 34 0:26 25 313 0 0:27 47 104 0 0:28 66 325 44 1:29 34 306 39 1:31 9 40 0 0:
GPSD,P=33.811350 -118.351433,D=2005-07-11T23:04:09Z

Note that the position and the mode are not always there... Remember that this is gpsd 2.13: it is possible this has been fixed since then. But I am now obligated to handle incomplete feeds, like in NMEA.

Now I remember Eric wrote in &quot;What's Wrong with NMEA 0183, and Why Fix It?&quot;: 'It is not possible to get a time/position/velocity report in a single sentence&quot;. It seems gpsd 2.13 is not perfect either in that respect. I suspect  gpsd 2.13 tries to report all NMEA data as soon as it receives it, so the gpsd records probably match the NMEA ones (I believe I saw a few posts about this..).

Anyway, once I got my NMEA tricks duplicated in the gpsd protocol decoder and it worked fine... for a while. After a few minutes, gpsd 2.13 dies. This gpsd never died on me when replaying NMEA logs in raw mode (of course, it has a lot less to do in the later case :-). It is true that I replay the log at 10 times the speed (gpsfake -c 0.1 ...), so this might be related. And again, this is a really an old version.

Anyway, a kismet-style support for the gpsd native protocol will be able in the next release of RoadMap. I am not too sure what RoadMap gained from it. At least I gained some useful knowledge.

BTW, I do have one question: gpsd manipulates most data as double. It now performs some error estimation logic (dop()). Did someone checked how much CPU this takes on an ARM, like on a PDA (the ARM has no floating point hardware)?

Thanks you for your help (and for reading all of this :-).
