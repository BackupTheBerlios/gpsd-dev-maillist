</I>
Hmm, I forget that the gps reports it's time. I'll grab a trace of a few
sentences in binary mode along with the system time tomorrow (today).

The problem happens even when the GPS has been running for 35 minutes
(about the time it takes me to drive home from work). Isn't the UTC
correction information sent every 10-15 minutes?

&gt;<i> * Speed reports cap at about 30MPH even when he's doing 60.
</I>
Minor correction: kph not mph. Also, it's not a 'cap' as in its normal
below the threshold and then just stops increasing as the car's speed
increases, it's wrong for all speeds.

And I've just realised, thinking about it, the speeds I'm getting after
converting the m/s value from the 'o' command to km/h seem to
numerically still be in m/s.

Eg: at 100kph I was getting a reading just shy of 30.

100kph * 3600 / 1000 = 27.8 m/s

Looking at the logs I've attached, I can't see any significant
difference in the speeds being reported in NMEA mode versus sirf -- it's
within 1 or 2m/s which taking into account the car changing speed
slightly going through pot-holes and the like would be about right.

&gt;<i> I can't duplicate this either.  Can anybody?  He's using a BU303.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * gpsd fails to reconnect to a GPS after the first time it's released.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This one really puzzles me.  I use a BU303 as one of my primary test
</I>&gt;<i> devices and I have *never* seen this.  Can anyone come up with any
</I>&gt;<i> theory about a site- or OS-specific bug that could produce this?
</I>
OS is Fedora 4 on x86 (Celeron-M laptop to be precise).

When I get time (it's almost 2am now) I'll grab some output from gpsd
with debugging enabled. What debugging level would be useful?

&gt;<i> I've asked Darryl for a packet log exhibiting the speed problem,
</I>&gt;<i> but received no reply.
</I>
Sorry about the delay in supplying this, been a murderous week at work.

Attached are log files from 2 tests using a simple telnet client I wrote
in python, which I've also attached. My client connects, enables watcher
mode, forces gpsd to NMEA mode, catches 60 sentences and then switches
to binary mode and catches 60 more sentences.

One test was done while stationary and the other one was done while
driving at 60kph down a straight road with cruise enabled.

I did also capture the output from gpsd when run with '-N -D7', but
silly me overwrote the 'moving' logfile by not removing tee from the
command line the next time I ran it. :(

I can send the stationary one if it'll help, or I can redo the moving
test again easily enough.

Hopefully this helps!

Regards
Darryl
