<PRE>Darryl Ross &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">spam at afoyi.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The problem happens even when the GPS has been running for 35 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> (about the time it takes me to drive home from work). Isn't the UTC
</I>&gt;<i> correction information sent every 10-15 minutes?
</I>
That's right.  So if you're seeing a 10-second lag after 35 minutes,
it isn't the UTC correction at issue.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; * Speed reports cap at about 30MPH even when he's doing 60.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Minor correction: kph not mph. Also, it's not a 'cap' as in its normal
</I>&gt;<i> below the threshold and then just stops increasing as the car's speed
</I>&gt;<i> increases, it's wrong for all speeds.
</I>
I have seen my gpsd/xgps setup report speeds higher than this while
watching it in the passenger seat of my wife's car.  That's using
the same BU303 + FC4 you have.  So there is something distinctly
odd going on here, and I wish I knew what.

Here's a good diagnostic first step: sirmon watches the raw binary
packet stream from your GPS.  Run sirfmon and watch how the velocity
(speed m/s) changes. If it tops 30kph, then the problem is somewhere
in gpsd.  If it doesn't, something your GPS is doing is pretty wack.

&gt;<i> And I've just realised, thinking about it, the speeds I'm getting after
</I>&gt;<i> converting the m/s value from the 'o' command to km/h seem to
</I>&gt;<i> numerically still be in m/s.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Eg: at 100kph I was getting a reading just shy of 30.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 100kph * 3600 / 1000 = 27.8 m/s
</I>
I have no idea what this means. All the drivers report speed in m/s.

&gt;<i> Looking at the logs I've attached, I can't see any significant
</I>&gt;<i> difference in the speeds being reported in NMEA mode versus sirf -- it's
</I>&gt;<i> within 1 or 2m/s which taking into account the car changing speed
</I>&gt;<i> slightly going through pot-holes and the like would be about right.
</I>
That's significant.  It means this isn't a SiRF-vs.-NMEA problem.
Which is a good thing, as the SiRF driver would be the most difficult
place to winkle a bug out of.
 
&gt;<i> When I get time (it's almost 2am now) I'll grab some output from gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> with debugging enabled. What debugging level would be useful?
</I>
-D 4.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I've asked Darryl for a packet log exhibiting the speed problem,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but received no reply.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry about the delay in supplying this, been a murderous week at work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attached are log files from 2 tests using a simple telnet client I wrote
</I>&gt;<i> in python, which I've also attached. My client connects, enables watcher
</I>&gt;<i> mode, forces gpsd to NMEA mode, catches 60 sentences and then switches
</I>&gt;<i> to binary mode and catches 60 more sentences.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One test was done while stationary and the other one was done while
</I>&gt;<i> driving at 60kph down a straight road with cruise enabled.
</I>
I'll look at these.  

One thing that would be useful would be a few seconds of raw SiRF packets
captured while you are moving at 60kph.  If I feed these through gpsfake 
and don't see speed above 30kph, that would be good -- it would mean the 
bug is reproducible.
