Loading code is the easy part. You send the magic message, and your
receiver drops into a bootloader and will begin to execute code you
send it.

I'm assuming you mean &quot;will sirf make it possible for us to load our
own user tasks into the firmware running on the receiver.&quot;

My guess is &quot;not likely&quot;. Some reasons why:
1) I'm pretty sure there's a lot of money to be made in selling SDK's
and support contracts.

2) It might be possible for us to bypass the BXA limits, thereby could
exposing SiRF to heavy-duty liability of some sort. Yes, it's the
crypto farce all over again, but this time it's with GPS.

3) Their OEMs would kill them for the support hassle this would cause.
Only one vendor even half-way supports firmware updates. All the other
vendors decided it caused too much hassle and too many &quot;warranty&quot;
returns.

But it'd be really cool... if we could.

&gt;<i> There are certain things like long-term tracklogs with velocity and
</I>&gt;<i> EPE tags that would be great to do in the gps module itself.  Eg. keep
</I>&gt;<i> a gps &quot;puck&quot; in your backpack or car along with 3 volts worth of
</I>&gt;<i> battery and record 1-second high resolution tracklogs suitable for
</I>&gt;<i> map-making.  Current hand-held GPS's only store a very small number of
</I>&gt;<i> points and usually forget about recording the signal-quality / EPE and
</I>&gt;<i> don't record the velocities at all.
</I>
There isn't all that much flash onboard the receiver. Most of the
little pucks I've seen are 4Mbit, though the board and firmware
support up to 16Mbit. Plus, I don't think most of the consumer
receivers have high endurance flash cells.

I've been knocking around the idea of a high resolution recorder
m'self, and I'm thinking this would be easier to do with some little
PC104 or small arm board just poking the serial really fast and
writing to flash. You could probably do it with a PIC. One side talks
to the serial port and the other talks to a big flash chip or serial
eeprom.

&gt;<i> It might even be possible to push some of the gpsd functions into the
</I>&gt;<i> GPS itself allowing.
</I>
I don't understand...

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
