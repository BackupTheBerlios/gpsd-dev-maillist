<PRE>Wolfgang S. Rupprecht &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">wolfgang+gnus20050630T094013 at dailyplanet.dontspam.wsrcc.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Eric, thanks for he note.  I didn't realize that there was such a
</I>&gt;<i> thriving development effort on gpsd.
</I>
It's built up gradually over the last year.  Last August it was basically 
just me blowing the dust off some basically sound but unmaintained software.
Since then we've had some extremely capable people show up to play here.
Not professional geodesists mostly, but people like you -- engineers with
a lot of deep domain knowledge about GPS-related stuff, timekeeping, etc.

That category doesn't include me, by the way.  I lean on other people
for the heavy GPS arcana; my skills are at software architecture and
I've been concentrating on goals like getting multiple-session support
right and zero-configuration operation.  So the autobauding and
protocol-recognition stuff and the strategy-pattern library
partitioning is all me, but (for example) the geoid compensations and
the matrix mathematics for DOP computation are from contributors who
showed up after I got here.

It's been a fun project.

&gt;<i> I certainly have no objections to merging the functionality of dgpsip
</I>&gt;<i> into gpsd.  I'm not sure it is worth the effort though.  My dgpsip had
</I>&gt;<i> a purpose back in 2000 when we had the better part of 50 meters
</I>&gt;<i> peak-to-peak &quot;selective availability&quot;-induced swings.  Now that that
</I>&gt;<i> nonsense is off, consumer-grade GPS's hardly change their readings
</I>&gt;<i> much when one connects them to a differential correction data stream.
</I>
Hm.  The SiRF engineer I've been talking with tells me the UERE
estimate he gives customers for a non-DGPS fix is 8 meters, while the
DGPS UERE is 2 meters.  That sounds like a difference worth chasing.
Is he being...er...optimistic about the capability of the hardware?

&gt;<i> Another complication is that we still don't have low-cost internet
</I>&gt;<i> connections available to the average outdoor or automotive laptop
</I>&gt;<i> user.  Without that there is no simple way to get differential
</I>&gt;<i> corrections to the users that could use them the most.
</I>
Understood.  I have no objection to designing ahead, though.

Over-air Internet is in rapid flux; the cost is going to drop 
and the ubiquity will rise as technologies like WIMAX get deployed.
If we can get gpsd to the point where it autoconfigures correctly
grabbing DGPS corrections from the nearest available server, there
*will* come a point -- not now, maybe, but a year or two out --
when somebody is going to be *deeply* thankful that we were
ahead of that curve.
 
&gt;<i> Just to give a bit of background, and hopefully this isn't common
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge to all the developers on the list.
</I>
Some of it's news to me...

&gt;<i>                                         There is an important
</I>&gt;<i> bit of difference between survey grade GPS's and consumer GPS's.
</I>&gt;<i> Consumer GPS's just look at the phase of the encoded data stream
</I>&gt;<i> coming from the satellites when trying to determine how far they are
</I>&gt;<i> from each satellite.  Survey GPS's start with that same rough data
</I>&gt;<i> stream and then look at the phase of the RF carrier to get a really
</I>&gt;<i> fine-grained picture.  It is not uncommon to see survey grade GPS's
</I>&gt;<i> advertised with sub-centimeter accuracies when used in a pairs with
</I>&gt;<i> differential correction data passed between them.  To do those types
</I>&gt;<i> of differential corrections much more data has to be passed from the
</I>&gt;<i> reference GPS to the mobile GPS.  The reference GPS also has to be
</I>&gt;<i> fairly close to the mobile GPS.  Using corrections from many 100's of
</I>&gt;<i> miles away isn't going to help much.  That tends to limit the
</I>&gt;<i> usefulness of internet-based differential corrections where there are
</I>&gt;<i> only a few reference GPS's sprinkled around the net.
</I>
Indeed. As you say, DGPSIP stations are too thin on the ground right
now for the feature to be of practical use in most of the U.S.  Yours
is the only public one I know of, and you're on the wrong coast :-).

But the existence of the EUREF project tells me that the Europeans
think they can get enough bang out of DGPS support to justify spending
some bucks on the station network.  And if they believe that, then gpsd
ought to support it. My philosophy about stuff like this is that when
somebody runs into an accuracy limit, I want them to *know* it isn't
my software.

&gt;<i> In any case, I'll certainly try to help out.  One thing I can do right
</I>&gt;<i> away is test gnomad (my long in development GPS mapping program)
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gnomad-mapping.com/">http://www.gnomad-mapping.com/</A> against the current gpsd.  I recall it
</I>&gt;<i> could use it just fine back when I last tried it.
</I>
OK. I'd appreciate it if you took a look at the following things:

1) Existing DGPSIP support.  I've just overhauled this; the code is in 
dgpsip.c and gpsd.c.  Scan it for bgons, if you will.

2) My error-modeling assumptions.  gpsd tries to compensate for
the fact that most GPSes don't even report the complete set of
DOPs, let alone error estimates in all seven degrees (t,x,y,z,
vx,vy,vz) of freedom.  To do this I compute missing DOPs fom the
satellite picture, then assume a UERE of 8 meters or 2 depending
as DGPS isn't/is available.  This is crude; is it possible to do
better?  The assumptions are documented in gpsd.h.

&gt;<i> If you folks do have the ear of one of the big GPS chip companies it
</I>&gt;<i> may be possible to get them to do things in a more computer-friendly
</I>&gt;<i> way.  I would love to see GPS's send clearly delimited, full updates
</I>&gt;<i> with everything in one message.
</I>
Trust me, I have sung this song to my contact at SiRF quite loudly.
