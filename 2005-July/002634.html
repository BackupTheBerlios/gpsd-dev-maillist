&gt;<i> Why does the entire struct has to be reversed?  Why not just shift bits

</I>
Well this is certainly a brain teaser and I learned something about
big-endian bit-fields in the process.

The simplest reason is that the C-language bitfields in a big-endian
are not laid out from lsbit to msbit as in a little-endian.  

struct {
       first:1;
       _pad:30;
       last:1;
};

In a LE &quot;first&quot; is at 1 and &quot;last&quot; is at 1&lt;&lt;31; in a BE it is the
other way around.  This is very fortunate because without it bitfields
that straddle byte boundaries would be discontiguous.

In fact, it took me a bit of head scratching to realize that C already
fixed up the discontiguous fields for me and my htonl-type
byte-swapping and other runtime hand waving to take parity of a
temporarily byte swapped copy, doing a temporary inversion, and
comparing to a bytes-swapped preamble pattern were all not needed.
Thats very good.  All that crap made the code even more unreadable.

&gt;<i> 2) Python is much, *much* better for long-term maintainability than Perl.

I'm no fan of perl.  I just use it.

&gt;<i> Fine, I'll look forward to both.

Awaiting testing of the gpsd/svn version.  The remote machine needs to
get a newer automake installed.

    Your automake version  is older than the suggested one, 1.7.6
    Go on at your own risk. :-)

    Configuring build environment for gpsd
    Makefile.am:9: HAVE_MOTIF does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
    Makefile.am:15: HAVE_DBUS does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
    contrib/Makefile.am:11: variable `DBUS_GLIB_LIBS' not defined
    contrib/Makefile.am:11: variable `GLIB_LIBS' not defined

    &lt;and no Makefile is produced&gt;

If you are really curious what the (untested) gpsd diffs look like:
