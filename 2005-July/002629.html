</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am fairly sure that the preamble is at the same location in both

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible to write a common test that just uses bit shift and mask
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operations, we could get rid of at least one functional hook.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If RTCM and subframes turn out to use compatible message structs,
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't we just add the subframe to the mama-of-a-union that
</I>&gt;<i> describes the rtcm messages?  I really worry about describing the
</I>&gt;<i> preamble in terms that don't derive from the struct definition.  It
</I>&gt;<i> means typo's can be introduced that the compiler can't catch for us.
</I>&gt;<i> It also makes both-endian code harder to maintain since the shifts are
</I>&gt;<i> different.
</I>
Undeniably you make some good points here.  But I feel pressure in the
other direction, too.  Mainly because, having worked really hard to
get all knowledge of the RTCM encoding into one sealed-off module, 
I really don't want to expose that struct again if I can help it.
 
&gt;<i> I have some big-endian code working on a sparc-64/obsd.  That should
</I>&gt;<i> be a worst case test.  Being a lazy git, I wrote a hack perl script to
</I>&gt;<i> invert each of the bitfields in the struct and generate a big-endian
</I>&gt;<i> version of the RTCM structs.  The upside is absolutely no increase in
</I>&gt;<i> run-time cost.  The downside is either two hand maintained sets of
</I>&gt;<i> structs that must track, or a perl script to generate the BE version
</I>&gt;<i> of the structs.
</I>
Why does the entire struct has to be reversed?  Why not just shift bits 
into the current word in the opposite direction?

I'd cheerfully live with a script to generate the reversed struct if
need be; I'm completely comfortable with that kind of hack, being
(evidently) the same sort of lazy git you are.  See, for example, the
way packet_names.h is generated from packet_states.h.

Though, please note, I'd prefer it in the scripting language the project
is already using, e.g. Python.  This is for two reasons:

1) Holding down gpsd's build dependencies.

2) Python is much, *much* better for long-term maintainability than Perl.

But don't worry about that, if you deliver Perl I'll just translate it.
It'll be, what, 30 lines of code?  And easily tested.

&gt;<i> Another problem was I didn't understand your bitreverse() function.
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;value&quot; term was never introduced (typo / same variable as the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;unsinged x&quot; input parameter???)  The best I could make out it
</I>&gt;<i> inverted each bit in the bitfield.  Thats not right, so I probably
</I>&gt;<i> didn't understand the intention of the code correctly. 
</I>
That function may not work at all.  I scraped it off a code-snippets
page on the Web.  That's wgy I warned you it wasn't tested.

&gt;<i> (A bit-inversion within the bitfields isn't the inversion thats wanted.
</I>&gt;<i> The most-significant-bits still are at &lt;&lt; that end of the big-endian
</I>&gt;<i> register.  We need to flip the bitfield locations within the 32-bit
</I>&gt;<i> words, but keep the order of the bits within the bitfields the same.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If that approach is ok with you I'll fold it into the current svn and
</I>&gt;<i> send you diffs.  I still owe you diffs for the decoder armoring in the
</I>&gt;<i> face of parity errors.  I haven't forgotten.
</I>
Fine, I'll look forward to both.
