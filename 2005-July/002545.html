<PRE>On 17 July I sent the following to Wolgang Rupprecht.  I'm posting it
here because:

(a) Wolfgang generally replies to mail promptly but didn't to this
one, making me suspect it got lost in the wires.

(b) Other RTCM-aware developers like Chris may well be interested.

Wolfgang S. Rupprecht &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">wolfgang at wsrcc.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry.  I'm pulling the RTCM decoder into the framework used by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other drivers.  That's necessary if RTCM sources are to become just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another automatically recognized packet type, which is where I'm going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with all this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No problem.  (Especially if your going to do the legwork to put it
</I>&gt;<i> into the other form.)
</I>
That I am.  In fact, it's about done.

I'm sorely tempted to write re-packing code that will go from Sanger
dump format to RTCM104, just so nobody will ever gave to deal with this 
crap at bit-level again. 

The version of my decoder in svn head now unpacks all known messages into
an intermediate structure that looks like this:

#define RTCM_WORDS_MAX	33
#define MAXCORRECTIONS	15	/* max correction count in type 1 or 9 */
#define MAXHEALTH	1	
#define MAXSTATIONS	3	/* maximum stations in almanac, type 5 */

	struct {
	    /* header contents */
	    unsigned type;	/* RTCM message type */
	    unsigned length;	/* length (words) */
	    double   zcount;	/* time within hour: GPS time, no leap secs */
	    unsigned refstaid;	/* reference station ID */
	    unsigned seqnum;	/* nessage sequence number (modulo 8) */
	    unsigned stathlth;	/* station health */

	    /* message data in decoded form */
	    union {
		struct {
		    unsigned int nentries;
		    struct {			/* data from messages 1 &amp; 9 */
			unsigned ident;		/* satellite ID */
			unsigned udre;		/* user diff. range error */
			unsigned issuedata;	/* issue of data */
			double rangerr;		/* range error */
			double rangerate;	/* range error rate */
		    } sat[MAXCORRECTIONS];
		} ranges;
		struct {		/* data for type 3 messages */
		    bool valid;		/* is message well-formed? */
		    double x, y, z;
		} ecef;
		struct {		/* data from type 4 messages */
		    bool valid;		/* is message well-formed? */
		    enum {gps, glonass, unknown} system;
		    enum {local, global, invalid} sense;
		    char datum[6];
		    double dx, dy, dz;
		} reference;
		struct {		/* data from type 5 messages */
		    unsigned int nentries;
		    struct {
			unsigned ident;		/* satellite ID */
			bool iodl;		/* issue of data */
			bool health;		/* is satellite healthy? */
			unsigned int snr;	/* signal-to-noise ratio, dB */
			bool health_en;		/* health enabled */
			bool new_data;		/* new data? */
			bool los_warning;	/* line-of-sight warning */
			unsigned int tou;	/* time to unhealth, seconds */
		    } sat[MAXHEALTH];
		} conhealth;
		struct {		/* data from type 7 messages */
		    unsigned int nentries;
		    struct {
			double latitude, longitude;	/* location */
			unsigned int range;		/* range in km */
			double frequency;		/* broadcast freq */
			unsigned int health;		/* station health */
			unsigned int station_id;
			unsigned int bitrate;
		    } station[MAXSTATIONS];
		} almanac;
		/* data from type 16 messages */
		char message[RTCM_WORDS_MAX * sizeof(u_int32_t)];
	    };

It then dumps the structure through a function that is all sprintf calls,
no black magic.  

It *almost* passes a regression test against the wsr dump of your
20050715_120805. Here's the first few lines of the diff, which are
completely representative

As you can see, the one thing it seems to get wrong is the health
field in the almanac record. 

I don't understand how that's happening, because the extraction code
in unpack() is a straight copy of a bitfield and it's just printed
through %u; would you take a look at it?  I fear it might be related
to that 9+3 vs. 10+2 ITU-vs.-RTCM difference you ran into.

I can't emit M lines the way you do, in-line of the output, but I have
equivalent debug messages.

Your test load only includes A, H, M, N, and S messages; is there any way
we can collect some data that includes others like R, C, and T?

The process of refactoring and splint-cleaning this code has raised
a number of questions:

1. How many health records can be attached to a type 5 message?  Your
type layout implies one only, but the documentation of Sanger's dump
format implies one *or more*.  Is this really possible in RTCM104, or
was he aggregating them from multiple messages?

2. I note some bitfields declared signed int: 

	pc1 in rtcm_msg1w3
	lon_h and lat in rtcm_msg7w3
	rangerate1 in rtcm_msg1w4
	rangerate2 in rtcm_msg1w5
	pc1 in rtcm_msg1w5
	rangerate3 in rtcm_msg1w7

Do the standards specify twos-complement notation for negative values?

3. The Sanger documentation says all fields are tab-separated, but you use
a dump format for C (message 5) that looks like this:

   &quot;C\t%2u\t%1u  %1u\t%2u\t%1u  %1u  %1u\t%2u\n&quot;,

It has embedded spaces.  What's the thinking behind that?

4. The Sanger documentation says of the station health field &quot;6 means
the transmission is unmonitored. 7 means the station is not working
properly. Other values are defined by the beacon operator.&quot;  Does either
standard you have access to have more to say about those values?

5. Of the health field in the A message (type 7), the Sanger
documentation says: &quot;has the same meaning as in the header, but it
indicates the health of the station for which this is an almanac.&quot;
But while the header field is 3 bits wide, the almanac field is
only 2 bits wide.  I don't see how these can be the same.

Looking at your comment about the 9+3 vs. 10.2, an unpleasant
suspicion grows on me -- maybe that difference is not just a typo.  
You've seen a 10+2 implementation; could Sanger have been looking
at a 9+3 one?

The values 6 and 7 won't fit in a 2-bit field....

If the ITU and RTCM standards clash, we need to have detection logic to tell
us which one we're looking at.  This can't be a compile-time option if there
are both kinds of transmitters in the world.

6. The code for handling unknown messages 

/* msg unknown */

struct rtcm_msgunk {
    struct rtcm_msghw1   w1;
    struct rtcm_msghw2   w2;

    uint            w3;
};

    default:
	{
	    struct msgunk    *m = (struct msgunk *) msghdr;

	    printf (&quot;U\t*** Unknown msg type! (len %d) ***\n&quot;, len);
	    while (len &gt;= 1){
		printf (&quot;U\t0x%08x\n&quot;, m-&gt;w3);
		len--;
		m = (struct msgunk *) (((RTCMWORD *) m) + 1);
	    }
	}
	break;

doesn't look quite right to me.  This looks like at each step m is
going to point at an entire rtcm_msgunk.  Shouldn't it just be 
pointing at an RTCMWORD?

7.  What is an &quot;LF transmitter&quot;, and how does it differ from a 
&quot;GPS reference receiver&quot;?  This is a term of art that our
rtcm(5) page should explain.

8.  How does one read the IOD field in satellite corrections?  Is it a just
a sequence number?

9. In the C message, what does the word &quot;soon&quot; associated with the new_data
field mean?  Can we pin that down to a number of seconds?

10. How much work would it take to implement the &quot;useful length&quot; report
and Sanger's T suffix?  Is the decoder logic actually already collecting this
information

  &quot;You have taught us much. Come with us and join the movement.&quot;
  &quot;This movement of yours, does it have slogans?&quot; inquired the Chink.
  &quot;Right on!&quot; they cried. And they quoted him some.
  &quot;Your movement, does it have a flag?&quot; asked the Chink.
  &quot;You bet!&quot; and they described their emblem.
  &quot;And does your movement have leaders?&quot;
  &quot;Great leaders.&quot;
  &quot;Then shove it up your butts,&quot; said the Chink. &quot;I have taught you nothing.&quot;
