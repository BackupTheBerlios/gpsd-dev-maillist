<PRE>&gt;<i> I've committed a first cut at Evermore binary support.
</I>
This is not going to work this way, because the Evermore protocol is very
similar to the TSIP protocol at framing level.  The state machine will not
be able to tell them apart this way, unless you only support one of them
at a time.

Maybe you should have a look at the TSIP driver and state machine for
(imo) a bit cleaner DLE-stuffing handling.  The Evermore people document
things in a very unclear way, but the framing is really just based on
DLE-STX data DLE-ETX where DLE in the data is doubled.  The length field
is just part of the data, and stuffed like any data field.  Same for the
checksum.

After reading a DLE you could tell TSIP and Evermore apart by the 02 byte
which never occurs immediately after DLE in TSIP (the byte after the
initial DLE is always 0x13 or above).

Try to make the state machine as strict as possible.  Protocols like this
are easily misdetected when the baudrate is wrong, as a 0x10 byte is quite
likely to come in (I had many misdetection problems while developing the
TSIP driver)
