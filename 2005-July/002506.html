<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I find it hard to believe that it will improve things...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We already know it does from Petr's report.
</I>
Well, my experience with spurious misdetections is that they are difficult
to reproduce.  When the scenario is indeed like I described, it will
probably be very hard to reproduce.
(the initial TSIP state machine had a small error which made it make wrong
decisions in some cases, but they happened infrequently.  it was the fact
that in these cases a memory area was overwritten as well that made me
find the cause.  it was fixed in two places: a limit check and an extra
state transition)


&gt;&gt;<i> The problem we had was that an Evermore packet was recognized as a TSIP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packet (which could happen when reading starts at the second DLE of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doubled-DLE halfway a packet) and the daemon switched to TSIP mode,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's OK. The state machine has been told to go to state DLE_LEADER,
</I>&gt;<i> not TSIP_LEADER, at the end of a TSIP packet -- so it will pick up the
</I>&gt;<i> Evermore leader on the next one.  Outcome: the TSIP driver will see
</I>&gt;<i> one garbaged packet, but gpsd will recover after that and correctly
</I>&gt;<i> sync up to the Evermore.
</I>
Yes, but that is not the problem...

&gt;<i> I recognize that there is still a problem in that the TSIP initializer
</I>&gt;<i> changes the link parity.  We do have to deal with that.
</I>
That is what needs to be catered for.

&gt;<i> You suggest alternative strategies of (a) sampling more packets before
</I>&gt;<i> locking on to a packet type, or (b) allowing the driver to kick the
</I>&gt;<i> packet getter back to ground state.  I'm resisting (a) because it
</I>&gt;<i> would increase first-fix latency, and (b) because of the design
</I>&gt;<i> heuristic that single things should be done in a single place. I think
</I>&gt;<i> it's the packet-getter's job to validate packets -- having some tests
</I>&gt;<i> in the driver itself could be a maintainance headache down the road.
</I>
On the other hand, this strategy could eventually paint you in the corner
when even more protocols surface that use the DLE-stuffing packet layer
(quite common for serial protocols) but have different payload structures.

&gt;<i> How about this instead; let's strengthen the driver model with a new
</I>&gt;<i> rule.  I am about to check in a change that will cause the driver wrap
</I>&gt;<i> function (if any) to get called whenever you change out of a driver,
</I>&gt;<i> not just when you close the associated device. (Presently only the iTrax
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> Earthmate GPSes have wrapup hooks, and calling either should be quite
</I>&gt;<i> safe.)
</I>
This we can do, it will not hurt in any case, I think.
