<PRE>&gt;<i> At 00:18 EDT this morning (28 July) I committed a change that passed
</I>&gt;<i> all regression tests but broke operation on live GPSes.  That change
</I>&gt;<i> has just been backed out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll improve the regression test set. :-)
</I>
It works again, thanks.  I did look around a bit but I could not spot an
obvious error.

However, what Andreas wrote about packet_names.h is true.
When running a make on a cleanly downloaded version, the make process
stops on a missing packet_names.h.
When &quot;make packet_names.h&quot; is entered it is created, and a plain &quot;make&quot;
then continues, but it is not picked up automatically.

I think this is because the makefile is not very clean.  Lots of things
are listed as depending on all sources, instead of well defined
dependencies for each individual file.  This also shows as a lot of
unnecessary compilations when only one .c file is modified.  You would
only expect that with .h files.

No idea if that automake tool can produce better makefiles.  I know for
sure that &quot;in the old days&quot; I wrote makefiles that were a lot simpler and
worked a lot better than this 1400-line piece of %^$#&amp;%@^%#&amp;...

Rob
