<PRE>This is a note on what I've been doing with rtcm.c intended mainly for
Wolfgang Rupprecht, but posted here because other developers may find
the information useful.

The rtcm code, as I fouund it, was clever, twisty, and a major improvement
on John Sager's old decoder -- but still a way too complicated and
large lump to be really good software engineering.  I set out to fix that.

My first goal was to separate report generation from decoding.  This
has been accomplished; unpack() and rtcm_dump() are separate
functions, and an intermediate structure holds extracted RTCM data in
a convenient C-native format.

My second goal was to enable operation on big-endian machines.  I think I've
actually done that, but the results have not yet been tested.  About
an hour ago I checked in an autoconf-based test for big-endianness
that is much simpler than the one Chris Kuethe was working up.

My third goal was to eliminate all but the bare necessary minimum of
casts and type punning from the code -- they made it hard to read.
This is why the long list of bitfield structures Wolfgang originally laid
out have coalesced into one big struct rtcm_msg_t; doing this enabled
me to get rid of all but one cast.

My fourth goal is to write a repack() function that inverts unpsck()
and will allow going from a synthetic or edited textual RTCM dump
to an RTCM-104 bit stream.  The grotty part -- C structure to 
bitfield mapping -- is done, but needs parity and inversion added  
(and of course testing and debugging).

My fifth goal is to separate the RTCM part from the low-level decoder,
in hopes of being able to re-use the low-level decoder for 50bps
subframe data.  This is why the 30-bit word has gone from being
named rtcmword_t to isgps30bit_t; the &quot;isgps&quot; is meant to relate
it to the IS-GPS-200 standard.

They're tied together is in the function rtcm_decode().  This really
ouught to be a thin wrapper around an isgps_decode() function that
calls unpack() afterwards when isgps_decode() is successful.  There
are two points of adhesion -- the PREAMBLE_TEST macro and the fact that
rtcm_decode() uses the frmlen field.  Ideally, PREAMBLE_TEST would
be written so it works for both variants and doesn't know anything
about struct rtcm_msg_t -- that's unpack's job.

The sixth and ultimate goal is to get the packet sniffer to recognize
an RTCM bitstream and segnent it into packets.
