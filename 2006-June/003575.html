<PRE>Dan Oetting &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">dan_oetting at qwest.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> t=-?: GPS computes the fix for the top of the next second
</I>&gt;<i> t=0.0: GPS begins to transmit data
</I>&gt;<i> t=0.a: GPSd receives all data for current cycle
</I>&gt;<i> 		and sends current fix to client, client records system time 
</I>&gt;<i> 		of fix
</I>&gt;<i> t=x: Client receives event and records system time of event
</I>&gt;<i> 		client computes delta (x - 0.a) to apply to fix from t=0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This still leaves the uncorrected offset (0.a - 0.0) (which can be a  
</I>&gt;<i> significant fraction of a second). The only current way for the  
</I>&gt;<i> client to correct for this error is to know that NTPd is running and  
</I>&gt;<i> has synchronized the system clock to the GPS time. If the system  
</I>&gt;<i> clock is not synchronized, attempts by the client to correct the fix  
</I>&gt;<i> could lead to gross errors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since GPSd is already capable of computing the time of the start of  
</I>&gt;<i> cycle to pass to NTPd it would be almost trivial to offset query mode  
</I>&gt;<i> results to the time of the query. This isn't a significant  
</I>&gt;<i> modification of the results since it is exactly what the GPS did when  
</I>&gt;<i> it computed the fix for the future cycle. GPSd was already thoughtful  
</I>&gt;<i> enough to include the fractional second in the time results.

The main problem with any approach based on interpolation is that we
are not guaranteed access to any timebase more accurate than the
GPS itself.  The HACKING file now has a new section on this issue 
that goes like this:

*** Combining buffering with interpolation: a speculative design

One possible choice (not let implemented in gpsd or its client
libraries) would be to combine buffering with interpolation.  Here's a
speculative design for a client which does its own extrapolation:

Thread 1: GPS handler.  Sets watcher mode.  Each time a report is
received, it stores that data along with the result of a call to
gettimeofday() (so that we have microsecond precision, rather than
just seconds from time()).  No need to double-buffer any data - just the
latest complete O report is sufficient.  When the client receives a query
from thread 2, it applies a differential correction to the last
reported position, based on the last reported velocity and the
difference between the stored gettimeofday() time and a new
gettimeofday() call.

Thread 2: main application.  Driven by whatever events you want it
to be.  Queries thread 1 whenever it needs an accurate GPS position
NOW.

The main problem with this approach is that it would require an 
onboard clock far more accurate than the GPS's once-per-second 
reports.  This is a problem; in general, we can't assume that 
a gpsd instance running in a car or boat will have access to
ntpd or NIST radio time signals.
