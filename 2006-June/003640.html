<PRE>I'm working on enabling gpsd to get the current leap-second offest from
authoritative sources.  This will mainly be useful for SiRF and 
Evermore chipsets in binary mode, which report uncorrected GPS time
but don't have an easy way to get the leap-second correction.

Evermore chips can't get the leap-second offset at all. They have to
fall back to the fixed offset compiled into timebase.h; this could be
trouble if the gpsd version is older than the last leap-second correction.

SiRF chips have a painful way to get the leap-second offset by
enabling reporting of subframe data. We don't enable this unless it
has been more than six months since the last known-good date for the
current compiled offset.

I have a Python module leapsecond.py that looks at the current IERS
Bulletin C and the U.S. Navy's history of the TAI-UTC on the Web.
It seems to work.  Does anyone know of other sources?  In particular,
is it possible to get this information from a local instance of ntpd?

My intention is to implement a local cache for leap-second
information at /var/run/leapsecond.  The rules for this cache would be:

1. It contains the current offset and the Unix timestamp of the last
offset change point (1 Jan or 1 Jul of the current year) for which the
offset is known good.

2. gpsd tries to read it when it needs the leap-second
correction. e.g. when an Evermore or SiRF-binary chip is recognized.

3. If it is six months after the last offset change point, the data
is considered stale.

4. If the cache data is fresh, get the offset from it. 

5. If the cache data is stale or nonexistent and the chip is SiRF, enable
subframe data to get the offset and write it into /var/run/leapsecond
when it arrives.

6. If the cache data is stale or nonexistent and the chip is Evermore,
call out to leapsecond.py to get the current offset.

7. If the call fails and the data is stale, use it anyway (it has
to be newer than the compiled-in offset).

8. If the call fails and the data is nonexistent, fall back to the
compiled offset.

Thoughts?  Comments?
