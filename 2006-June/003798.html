<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; What's the motivation for the second flush, as opposed to a longer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delay length?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I think with a USB device the change will not happen immediately (as
</I>&gt;<i> with a UART) because it has to be sent as a message to the external
</I>&gt;<i> processor that has to act upon it, and may still have buffered data.  It
</I>&gt;<i> may be that the flush is not asking the external processor to flush its
</I>&gt;<i> buffers as well, but will only clear the kernel buffers.  So, there will
</I>&gt;<i> be some time that old data is still arriving even after the speed change
</I>&gt;<i> command has been sent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is why I suggested to delay first and then flush.  But as the exact
</I>&gt;<i> implementation may be different, I thought it may be prudent to flush,
</I>&gt;<i> delay and flush again.
</I>
Wisely thought and well spoken.  I'm going to add an explanatory comment 
to the code based on this analysis.  

My only demurral will be that the change doesn't happen instantly with
UARTs either; I know this from reading a Serial Device HOWTO sometime
back.  But from userspace it can *look* instant because a well-written
device driver for a simple device like the 14550 with fixed response
timings can deterministically delay the return until the UART is in a
good state.  What you've done is pointed out why a USB converter can't
necessarily do that.

We'll then merge in the sequence of flush/delay/flush that Til reports
working.

Finally, we'll try to tune the delays based on Chris Kuethe's character-time
analysis.
