<PRE>Robin L Darroch &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">robin at spade-men.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Pull-mode clients shouldn't NEED to know about cycles... because we 
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much invented them.
</I>
Perhaps this is our basic point of disagreement.  You think we invented 
cycles.  I think they're intrinsic to the way GPSes report data, and that
the policy in place now elects not to try to hide them.

&gt;<i> That is not what I'm saying we should do: I'm saying we should not 
</I>&gt;<i> act as if a new timestamp *implicitly* invalidates data not included 
</I>&gt;<i> in the sentence that just arrived with the new timestamp... because 
</I>&gt;<i> there doesn't seem to be any actual evidence that it should.
</I>
My assumption here is that each new timestamp represents a new fix.
gpsd's job is to report the current fix, not to mix data from the
current fix with data from the last one.

&gt;<i> I would agree if there were any additional &quot;holding&quot; going on - but 
</I>&gt;<i> there isn't.
</I>
Under your policy, there would be.

&gt;<i>                                                    It is only our 
</I>&gt;<i> decision that a new timestamp implicitly invalidates all previous fix 
</I>&gt;<i> data which is at issue here.
</I>
Who said anything about invalidating?  We're simply declining to pretend
that data not yet present in the new fix is actually present.

&gt;<i>                                                   What's more, the 
</I>&gt;<i> current CASOS logic DOESN'T DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO.  The timestamp 
</I>&gt;<i> checking and updating logic is missing from the GGA parser 
</I>&gt;<i> altogether, so if the unit in question has GGA at the start of the 
</I>&gt;<i> cycle, then what we currently have is &quot;clear in the middle of the 
</I>&gt;<i> cycle&quot;, and we're ALWAYS returning both old data and 
</I>&gt;<i> incorrectly-invalidated NaNs (i.e. the data from the GGA received at 
</I>&gt;<i> the start of the cycle is discarded when the RMC arrives later in the 
</I>&gt;<i> same cycle).
</I>
Examining nmea_parse.c, I find you are correct.  Fix committed to svn.
