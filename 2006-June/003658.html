I have no problem if there is a new way to request a full data snapshot.
That makes a lot of sense and would enable a simple client to simply
poll current data.  My problem is more with touching the streaming
data or changing the current data flow in ways that will unexpectedly
break existing apps.  Adding to the current framework is good, changing
it in a way that will break existing apps should only be done very
deliberately.

If we add a new command, or option, to do this, then we need to be very
explicit about what data we will cache, for how long, and under what
conditions.  One big problem is when and how to expire data.  How long
should an altitude be held before being tossed?  How long would sats be
held before being tossed?  Clearly they can not be the same time since
some NMEA only provides altitude ever few seconds and sats every minute.
Depending on the application I see that some apps may want very short
or very long timeouts so this should also be adjustable.

Then we need to add the complexity of under what conditions would data
be tossed early?  Like when the GPS is unplugged.

I am most nervous about adding complexity to the core functions that we
already know are hard to get just right.  IMHO gpsd should be as lean
and mean as we can make it so we can be sure it is correct and robust.
I hate to burden an embedded device with these new data processing
overhead when they have limited CPU and RAM.  They already have us cut
things for them and this would also need a cutout.  So what is the
argument against putting these higher level smarts in libgps or another
daemon?

It seems to me that if someone is writing a really simple client then
they would be using libgps or similar.  THey do not want to hassle with
the already non-trvial gpsd protocol.  They just want to link in a nice
library and pull what they need out of it.

I also see a trend toward a very simple robust core daemon and then
associated daemons to run more complex functions.  Just to name a few
postfix, doveot and apache have gone this route.  So we should also
consider a secondary daemon that could be used as a proxy cache for gpsd
data.  As a standalone daemon it would be much easier to audit than
mashing more into gpsd.
