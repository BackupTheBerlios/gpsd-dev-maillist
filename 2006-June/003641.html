Except this isn't the kind of thing that any user is likely to want 
to change dynamically in their GPSd - or indeed ever.  Most users 
will be happy with &quot;buffer all, never clear&quot; (as has been shown by 
the existing reports of problems on the users list, as opposed to the 
complete absense of reports of problems with the faulty CaSoC logic). 
Those that want it to clear-at-start-of-cycle will always want it 
that way, so it could even be a configure option.

</I>
It can't really be there, because gpsd using CaSoC (not sure why I 
kept spelling that &quot;CaSoS&quot;, except phonetically) logic has already 
discarded the data, so there's nothing sensible that libgps can do to 
recover it for query-mode clients, and adding code to handle it just 
for watcher mode clients would be a huge waste of time, not to 
mention introducing a lot more ways for things to go wrong.  The 
trick is, gpsd *knows* the instant a sentence is received that 
supercedes previous data, so it can realistically do both options 
without risking reporting known-invalid data (I'm not just making it 
up: I've done it and tested it to the n'th degree).  libgps, on the 
other hand, has no idea what gpsd is receiving from the gps, so it 
can't reliably know when to invalidate data in any additional buffer 
we might add to it.

Perhaps this is a compile-time switch rather than a command-line 
switch (although I'm not sure why you hate command-line switches 
so... they occasionally serve a purpose), but it definitely can't go 
further &quot;down the line&quot; than that, because it just won't work.

Remember, the very worst case scenario that anyone has come up with 
for &quot;never clear&quot; is that you get an O report with an altitude (for 
example) that came from a sentence with a timestamp one second 
earlier than the latitude and longitude reported in the same O. 
Because of the fault in the CaSoC logic, everyone has been having 
this problem all along, and yet there hasn't been a single complaint 
about it, even from the loggers that Gary was talking about.  By 
contrast, there have been plenty of complaints about the altitude or 
speed/track data jumping between numeric and NaN (which parameters 
jitter depends on the version of GPSd you're using), and we have a 
simple solution to it.  It doesn't seem like too much to ask to put 
that in as a compile-time or command-line option... and just to 
reduce support e-mails about the issue, I'd strongly suggest making 
it the default.

Anyhow, this issue is starting to affect my sleep, so I will try not 
to let it do so any more.  I care about it a lot because I'd like to 
see GPSd become a very widely adopted standard for sharing GPS units 
(something I see happening a lot more in future), and having to send 
people to an FAQ when they ask &quot;my GPS has a good view of the sky... 
why is my data jittering?&quot; just puts another obstacle in the way of 
widespread adoption.  Don't lie to people: by all means, explain in 
the documentation what the two buffering-logic options are (you've 
written a pretty good description in the white paper - just copy and 
paste for the most part)... then let them choose if they want the 
purer form that causes fake jitter (which they'll then have to code 
around in their client), or the more usable form which may sometimes 
mix one-second-old data with zero-second-old data (but which they 
won't need to add special code to handle in every application they 
develop).

In the end, it has to come down to either a command-line switch or a 
compile-time option... it can't work anywhere else.  I've created the 
command-line switch version, but I'm not really sufficiently 
comfortable with autoconfs and makefiles and the like to do the 
compile-time version instead: if that's what you think is best, 
hopefully it is easy enough for someone with that know-how to hack my 
patch to be compile-time rather than command-line.

Cheers,
Robin
