<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>I have a response to your long post on buffering in the works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>It has already helped me significantly improve the discussion in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the HACKING file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds ominous... I was hoping my post would have lead to the
</I>&gt;<i> realisation that &quot;Buffer all, report on every packet, never clear
</I>&gt;<i> data&quot; is the best way to go, thereby helping you to commit my patch.
</I>&gt;<i> :)  Still, if you think there are problems which my response didn't
</I>&gt;<i> cover, I'll be more than happy to allay your concerns.
</I>
The problem is that once you discuss this, people (in this case Dan
Oetting) invariably step up to bring up the point of latency, and how nice
it would be if that would be handled well.
Stuff like interpolation, extrapolation, etc.  See the message of May 23.

This then makes others realize that it is more complicated than one would
think, and put the whole issue on the TODO list again.

So yes, it would be nice to have buffering (IMHO) but it can only be done
when the issue of latency is marked as &quot;won't solve&quot; first.

I think that with some careful coding it should be possible to ship the
correct timestamp with the data.
I.E. not the current time, but the time that accompanied the data when it
was received from the GPS.  this supposedly is the time-of-fix.
People that want to have &quot;current position&quot; of a moving object and are
willing to extrapolate from earlier readings can then do so in the client
application.  We should not do this in gpsd.
(the ability to extrapolate depends on the availability of a synchronized
clock.  such applications should require the installation and
configuration of ntpd)
