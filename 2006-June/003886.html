<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The n=1 command just causes gpsd to return n=0.  It has no effect.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't looked at the code, but I suspect if an &quot;alternate  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode&quot; (as defined in the man pages) is not detected at startup,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then gpsd will not change to any alternate mode - it doesn't know  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which of the MANY modes to change to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've had it return N=0 for N=1 and vice versa, simply because I had  
</I>&gt;<i> another client connected at the time, but it subsequently allowed  
</I>&gt;<i> me to change when I disconnnected the other client... but I  
</I>&gt;<i> understand that probably isn't your issue.  What does your I  
</I>&gt;<i> command return?
</I>
n=0

&gt;<i> Perhaps, but from the point of view of GPSd, I don't think *we*  
</I>&gt;<i> should forget about NMEA with GPSd... there may still be a number  
</I>&gt;<i> of cases where that is the preferred or only option, and we have to  
</I>&gt;<i> aim to support it as well as possible.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Robin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.  I understand that from the point of your own testing, you  
</I>&gt;<i> want the &quot;roll your own&quot; version, but I'd be interested to know if  
</I>&gt;<i> my binary version works better for you.  It is quite specific in  
</I>&gt;<i> the ReadMe file about what it installs and where, so it's quite  
</I>&gt;<i> easy to purge it from your system altogether when you're done  
</I>&gt;<i> testing it.
</I>&gt;<i> -- 
</I>&gt;<i>

I downloaded your latest &quot;gpsdX&quot; package and manually installed your  
gpsdX &amp; libgps.dylib.  These provided consistent results for both  
cgps &amp; xgps.  ALWAYS a solid 3D fix &amp; location.  KisMAC also worked  
as well, just as it used to with older versions of gpsd.

It looks like some change in more recent versions of gpsd (2.30+) has  
broken or changed the way NMEA is handled.  I had not used my GPS in  
a while jumped from a 6+ month old version, to current, around 2.30.

Per your site, your gpsdX is based on gpsd 2.32.  What changes have  
you made, to 2.32?
