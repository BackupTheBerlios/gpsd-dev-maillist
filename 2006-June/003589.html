I realise you don't have an NMEA unit, but you're 100% mistaken in 
the above claim: my patch works fine no matter when in the cycle the 
data arrives... indeed, that's *exactly the point*.  The CURRENT 
LOGIC is what causes all the problems with that kind of data 
source... I know - I've got one!  With the current logic, using an 
NMEA unit like you describe will generate artificial jitter (i.e. 
GPSd returns NaN for altitude when in fact the GPS unit has a valid 
altitude which it reported barely a second ago).  That is why we 
SHOULD NOT clear at start of cycle - because the start of cycle is 
largely an artificial construct, and there has been no case yet cited 
where GPSd will actually return invalid data with my patch applied 
(I've already refuted those listed in Eric's white paper).

I know debate over such fundamental design principles is important, 
but there comes a point where I think it's worth giving it a try, and 
seeing if anyone can actually find a genuine problem with it.  I've 
been running a patched version for over two months now, with a range 
of real-world clients, and a SiRF-II/NMEA source with an output 
pattern just like you've mentioned.  It works perfectly.  What's 
more, everyone who's downloaded a copy of my Mac OS X binary has been 
running the patched version, and there has not been a single 
complaint of problems with data quality.

I apologise if some frustration is coming across in my e-mails now... 
but it is getting frustrating to be told by people for whom the patch 
will make no difference that there's something wrong with it, when 
the unpatched version behaves so badly for those for whom the patch 
*will* make a difference: it feels like being told by a blind person 
that you've chosen the wrong colour to paint your walls.  The TNT 
patch is being held up pending real-world testing - which I 
appreciate (and entirely agree should be the case) - but here the 
real-world testing that has already been done is being discounted in 
favour of arguments which have yet to offer substantiated claims of 
drawbacks.

Trust me - when we get through this (and we will, because I DON'T 
want to have to maintain a forked version indefinitely), it will all 
seem like much ado about nothing... but I have faith that we'll come 
to a sensible conclusion.

I also await further input on the O-mode patch... I'm pretty sure of 
that one, but if Eric or someone else comes up with actual data 
showing &quot;random garbage&quot; altitudes returned with a 2D fix, I'm 
prepared to write a different patch.

Cheers,
Robin
