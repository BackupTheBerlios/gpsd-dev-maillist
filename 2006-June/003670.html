Yep - fair call.  This is another reason to prefer the compile-time option.

Yes - this is another reason why I don't like the idea of it being a 
runtime command: we are, by the very nature of the issue, dealing 
with a single set of data for all clients.  Therefore the 
buffer-clearing logic for one client must be the same buffer-clearing 
logic for all clients.  Clear-at-Start-of-Cycle destroys data, so 
there is no way to &quot;simulate&quot; Never-Clear results accurately by a 
layer that follows it - the data has been destroyed, and any 
subsequent layer has no knowledge of why it has been destroyed (was 
it genuinely invalidated by loss of fix or new sentence invalidating 
that parameter, or was it simply a casualty of the start-of-cycle 
clear?).

The decision has to be made by the server administrator.  However, we 
COULD easily provide a command for clients to *check* what decision 
the server administrator made when building gpsd.  In my opinion, 
that's the perfect solution: the remaining J command!  &lt;singing 
Cookie-Monster style&gt;J is for Jitter and that's good enough for 
me&lt;/singing&gt;.

client-&gt;gpsd: J

gpsd-&gt;client: J=0 (jitter off = never-clear logic in use)
    OR
gpsd-&gt;client: J=1 (jitter on = clear-at-start-of-cycle logic in use)


&gt;<i>  &gt; Remember, the very worst case scenario that anyone has come up 
</I>&gt;<i>with for &quot;never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  clear&quot; is that you get an O report with an altitude (for example) that came
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  from a sentence with a timestamp one second earlier than the latitude and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  longitude reported in the same .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One second or one cycle?  What about GPS that only report less than
</I>&gt;<i>once a second?  Like the EC-10X?
</I>
Fair point - it is actually one cycle... which is just *usually* one 
second.  Reviewing the data in the test directory, the EC-10 returns 
only one timestamped sentence per cycle, so will behave identically 
in either mode: no matter what, you get the same age of data 
regardless of the buffer-clearing chosen.
