Did a further test on this today: parked the car on the side of the 
road, marked present position as a waypoint, then drove back along 
the road, started a raw dump alongside the client program I'm working 
on, and headed towards that point at speed (speed limit 90kph).  The 
result?  No measurable delay in position reports.

The ETE in my client (which is based on distance to run and VMG) 
counted down smoothly to what would have been zero as I passed the 
point, and stopping the R output at the same instant proved that the 
GPS was reporting correctly where I was at the time (within about 1 
second's worth of my velocity at the time, which is about the limit 
of GPS accuracy anyway).

So, only three possibilities remain that I can see:

1) the aircraft GPS to which I was comparing actually anticipates 
position slightly (this would be odd, but possible)
2) my particular GPS unit develops a position lag at high speeds 
(with a consequential increase in lag occurring between 90 and 350kph)
3) my particular GPS unit lags only when in SiRF-II binary mode 
(again, fairly unlikely)

I suppose that means 2 is the most plausible, although I'm not sure I 
can explain it very well.  I'll be able to rule out 3 next time I go 
flying with it.
