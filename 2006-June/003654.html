<PRE>Ville Nuorvala &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">vnuorval at tcs.hut.fi</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Ok, so in stead of for example 'gpsd /dev/rfcomm0' you would like to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to say 'gpsd gps.example.com[:port]' to get remote GPS data over
</I>&gt;<i> the net. Did I understand you correctly?
</I>
That's right.  The idea is to support two things:

1) Command line arguments can be a mixture of local device files and
server:port specifications.

2) Whenever you connect to either a device file or server:port stream, 
the packet sniffer figures out what kind of data is actually coming 
from that source and dispatches to the right handler for it.

Possible source types used to be NMEA, several GPS binary protocols, or 
RTCM104.  Now I guess the packet sniffer needs to know how to recognize an
NTRIP data stream as well.  Because the protocol is textual, 
I'm guessing that probably is not hard.

Take a look at packet.c.  I think what's going on there is fairly clear.

&gt;<i> So in stead of reading from a device file, the GPS data could be read
</I>&gt;<i> from the socket, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do we want to support only NMEA sentences or do we want to accept vendor
</I>&gt;<i> specific raw data formats from these remote sources? (Or does the format
</I>&gt;<i> even matter?)
</I>
See above about the packet sniffer.  What I'm after here is to
decouple the type of the input source (device or remote server) from
the input stream protocol, which gpsd should autodetect.

The ultimate goal is to get to where you give gpsd any mixture of
local or remote data sources you like and it just does the right
thing.  That is, some can be GPS, some can be RTCM, some can be NTRIP, and
gpsd figures out how to integrate them according to a documented
set of combination rules.  Clients get to choose which data source(s)
to listen to.

&gt;<i> Assuming we have several different type data sources how do we define
</I>&gt;<i> their type? Is something like 'gpsd <A HREF="gps://gps.example.com">gps://gps.example.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="ntrip://ntrip.example.com">ntrip://ntrip.example.com</A>' acceptable?
</I>
No type definitions.  gpsd should figure it out.

&gt;<i> Assuming we get different type data from the same source (for example
</I>&gt;<i> another gpsd instance), how do we demultiplex the data to the right handler?
</I>
That's what the packet sniffer is for.  It autodetects the kind of data
coming down the wire and selects the right handler.

&gt;<i> And a related question: What is the protocol for dumping such GPS/DGPS
</I>&gt;<i> data like? Do we just dump the raw data (like we do with DGPS data in
</I>&gt;<i> Ntrip and DGPS-IP after the initial handshake) or do we prepend some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of header to it indicating what type of data is carried in the payload?
</I>
I'm not completely certain I undestand this question.  
At the moment we have two rules:

1) Ship incoming GPS data to watchers as sequences of O and Y reports

2) Ship incoming RTCM104 to watchers in the format described in rtcm-104.xml

The idea is that if there are both GPS and RTCM channels, clients get 
to choose which they monitor.

The Sanger dump format described in rtcm-104.xml might do for dumping NTRIP,
too; I don't know.

&gt;<i> Sorry for all the questions, but I need more info to get a better
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of this all.
</I>
Of course.  You just did an excellent job on the NTRIP support, so I'm
rewarding you by handing you a bigger job :-).
