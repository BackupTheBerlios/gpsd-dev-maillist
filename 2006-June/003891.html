</I>
What I am describing is a receiver that tracks the baud rate changes  
autonomously so the same code that handles the initial autobaud  
detection will handle commanded baud rate changes and as a side bonus  
will handle unexpected changes as well. The startup state would be  
the same as just after a baud rate change where further output is  
blocked until the receiver locks onto the GPS. In the case of a  
commanded baud rate change, a hint could be left to help the receiver  
pick the new mode when it changes.

&gt;&gt;<i> The receiver can detect that the GPS baud rate is different than the

</I>
The process won't be as efficient but the code is probably simplified  
by ignoring framing errors.

&gt;<i> When you want to look for framing errors, you will have to cater for

</I>&gt;<i> TSIP protocol it switches the serial interface to odd parity to be  
</I>&gt;<i> able to
</I>&gt;<i> really communicate)
</I>
The 9th bit parity would show up as a framing error on half the  
bytes. Without framing error reports it can only be deduced by  
detecting the protocol first as is currently done.


&gt;&gt;<i> Looking at what normal data would look like at various baud rates, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it should be possible to directly detect a number of nearby
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speeds and in most cases jump directly to the correct speed. Once on

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stop bits should also be fairly simple.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aren't you assuming that you already know the protocol?
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it is that simple to directly detect both an unknown  
</I>&gt;<i> speed
</I>&gt;<i> and an unknown protocol (NMEA, SiRF, TSIP, Zodiac etc) from a  
</I>&gt;<i> buffer of
</I>&gt;<i> garbage read at an incorrect speed.
</I>&gt;<i> However, when you already know it is NMEA it might be possible to  
</I>&gt;<i> guess
</I>&gt;<i> the speed.
</I>
The buffer isn't totally lacking information. At Nx speed the lower  
N-1 bits of each byte will always be 0s. So a simple rule would be to  
step down by 8x when all that is seen is nulls otherwise step down to  
the highest frequency seen in the data. When the receiver is slower  
than the data, the information gets mangled more but there may still  
be statistical patterns that can be recognized that correspond to  
each protocol at different higher speeds If nothing else, just step  
up by a factor of 8 and look again.
