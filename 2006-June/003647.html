<PRE>Robin L Darroch &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">robin at spade-men.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> It can't really be there, because gpsd using CaSoC (not sure why I 
</I>&gt;<i> kept spelling that &quot;CaSoS&quot;, except phonetically) logic has already 
</I>&gt;<i> discarded the data, so there's nothing sensible that libgps can do to 
</I>&gt;<i> recover it for query-mode clients, and adding code to handle it just 
</I>&gt;<i> for watcher mode clients would be a huge waste of time, not to 
</I>&gt;<i> mention introducing a lot more ways for things to go wrong.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> trick is, gpsd *knows* the instant a sentence is received that 
</I>&gt;<i> supercedes previous data, so it can realistically do both options 
</I>&gt;<i> without risking reporting known-invalid data (I'm not just making it 
</I>&gt;<i> up: I've done it and tested it to the n'th degree).  libgps, on the 
</I>&gt;<i> other hand, has no idea what gpsd is receiving from the gps, so it 
</I>&gt;<i> can't reliably know when to invalidate data in any additional buffer 
</I>&gt;<i> we might add to it.
</I>
Fair point.  This is a good argument for having a switch in the daemon.

&gt;<i> Perhaps this is a compile-time switch rather than a command-line 
</I>&gt;<i> switch (although I'm not sure why you hate command-line switches 
</I>&gt;<i> so... they occasionally serve a purpose), but it definitely can't go 
</I>&gt;<i> further &quot;down the line&quot; than that, because it just won't work.
</I>
I hate command-line switches, on this particular project, for three reasons.
The first doesn't apply to this case; the second and third do.

(1) Command-line switches are often a lazy programmer's way out of writing
correct adaptive logic.  This is why I keep rejecting requests for a baud-rate 
switch and a GPS type switch -- the *right* thing is to make the packet-sniffer
work better, and if I relented in my opposition the pressure to get that
right would disappear.  Suddenly we'd be back to end-users having to
fiddle with settings the software ought to figure out for itself, which
is unacceptable.

(2) Command-line switches without corresponding protocol commands 
pin the daemon's behavior for its entire lifespan. Why should the user
have to fix his/her data-hold policy at startup time and never get to 
change their mind afterwards?  Stupid design...

(3) Command-line switches can only be changed in the hotplug script.  
Requiring end-users to modify hotplug scripts (or anything else in
admin space) is a crash landing.

Hm...I think I'll add the above rant to HACKING...
