</I>
ntpd does not know anything about GPS time.  so, it cannot tell you if
the current GPS time offset is 13 or 14 seconds.

What ntpd *could* tell you, is that a leap second is coming up, and when.
However, I don't think that is particularly interesting information at
the current rate at which leap seconds are applied.

(and for this information it has to rely on data from other timeservers.
at the last leap second half a year ago, big mess resulted from some
servers knowing about the upcoming leapsecond, and other not knowing
about it.  I am not sure about the actual implementation in NTP, but it
would seem logical to me that servers could communicate &quot;leap second
coming up&quot;, &quot;no leap second coming up&quot;, and &quot;don't know&quot;.  However, it
looked like there is no &quot;don't know&quot; status and servers not implementing
a pre-announcement of the leapsecond just assumed there was none, even
when peers told them there was.   I don't know if this was a bug in
NTP implementations or an omission in the protocol.)

That said, we don't have support for leap second announcement in gpsd.
Is anyone aware of any announcement information in the protocols that
we currently support?  I have encountered current GPS time offset in
a couple of protocols, and if I remember well, no annoucements.
Longwave timestandard transmitters often announce the upcoming leapsecond
some time in advance, and ntpd (and the Linux kernel) can use this
annoucement to neatly insert the extra second without having to slowly
lock onto a suddenly changed reference time.  My system heard about the
leapsecond from DCF77, neatly inserted the extra second, and remained
in sync with GPS (via gpsd) which just stepped time.  Others lost sync
and slowly locked on the new reference time, thinking the local clock
was one second off.

As I did not see this in protocol references yet, I assumed that GPS
does not send those announcements and just updates the offset at the
right moment.  However, during the last leap second it appeared that
some GPS-referenced servers knew about the leap second.
Maybe it is available somewhere in the almanac data...  but as we know,
it is no joy to decode information from there :-)

Of course, when you have ntpd setup to lock onto gpsd (via SHM) and also
have several external timeservers in the ntpd configuration, you could
determine the actual GPS time offset by looking at the difference between
system time and GPS time when ntpd is locked to some external sources.
However, I think this is not a very wise strategy as you have to
completely rely on the selection of timeservers by ntpd (which often
seems quite nondeterministic) and hope that the accuracy of locked
system time and time in messages from your GPS receiver is good enough
to reliably determine the integral difference between them.
It also requires an uncommon system configuration (ntpd configured with
both gpsd and several reachable external servers).0
