<PRE>&gt;<i>I was preparing a whole long response to Robin's post on this topic, but
</I>&gt;<i>Gary has put the central objection in a nutshell here.  If we held data
</I>&gt;<i>from a previous cycle, we would be pretending that the daemon knows
</I>&gt;<i>something it doesn't.  We would, in fact, be lying to the client.
</I>
As I say - we have a choice between two lies: the nature of the 
protocol makes it impossible for us to avoid a lie.

&gt;<i>Yes, GPSes sometimes lie this way when they perform dead-reckoning or
</I>&gt;<i>interpolation in the absence of a good fix.  That is not a warrant
</I>&gt;<i>for gpsd to add another layer of guesswork and prevarication on top
</I>&gt;<i>of what the GPS tells it.
</I>
And I wouldn't suggest for a moment that we add such a layer.

&gt;<i>  &gt;                                                    What is a client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  to do when the REAL altitude shows up on the current timestamp and it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  is different than the LAST altitude reported in the current timestamp.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  This will really confuse data logging programs or any program doing its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  own calculation on the data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I hadn't thought of this possibility.  It's a powerful argument for Gary's
</I>&gt;<i>position, but not the conclusive one; see below.
</I>
I still think it's unfair to put that kind of client - which would 
almost certainly be better off using R mode - ahead of EVERY other 
possible kind of client.

&gt;<i>Here's the showstopper, the conclusive argument.  Data delivered according
</I>&gt;<i>to policy (1) can be interpreted to simulate policy (2), *but the reverse
</I>&gt;<i>is not true*.  That is, under policy (2) we could not distinguish in the
</I>&gt;<i>output of gpsd between data reported and data held.  But under policy(1)
</I>&gt;<i>the client is free to perform whatever data smoothing it likes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Case closed: gpsd will continue to clear data at start of cycle.
</I>
I hate to reopen the case, but there has to be an appeal process: and 
here's why.  GPSd supports more than just the W command.  If it 
supported nothing but Watcher mode clients, I'd accept your argument. 
However, one of the best things about GPSd is it allows clients to 
ASK for data.  By keeping &quot;clear at start of cycle&quot; logic, we kill 
all such attempts to use query-based clients, because they can never 
know whether they'll be unlucky enough to query just after the start 
of the cycle or not.  Only PUSHED data delivered under policy 1 can 
be used to simulate PUSHED data delivered under policy 2 (although it 
can be a right pain to do so) - but PULLED data delivered under 
policy 1 is useless.

Now, if GPSd is going to leave all query-mode clients out to rot, 
then that's a pretty major decision to make, and should be made 
explicitly - making that decision as the unspoken consequences of 
looking at only one case is not appropriate.

I would say that the argument, in fact, runs the other way: clients 
that want server-pushed data with explicit timestamp-to-data matching 
have a method of doing so even if we run with policy (2): use R mode. 
So something that wants policy (1) can still have it.  We could even 
extend libgps to handle R mode data for that kind of application. 
But query-based clients will have NO way of getting reliably valid 
responses if we run with clear-at-start-of-cycle logic: they will 
continue to see apparently random jitter between valid and invalid 
data, based on pure chance of timing.

We already know that the random jitter introduced by the existing 
attempt at CASOS logic is a problem for more people than just me, 
based on a number of posts already seen on the users mailing list. 
On the other hand, not one single complaint has yet been received 
about the fact that CASOS isn't currently working, despite the fact 
that it isn't.

Now THAT seems like a better conclusive argument.

Case closed: gpsd will no longer clear data at the start of cycle. :)

Alternatively, I look forward to further discussion...

Cheers,
Robin
