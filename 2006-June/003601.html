Well, it is there, once you buy off on the next ppint.

</I>
The whole point of the protocol is to say that the time, in the past,
noted by the time stamp, the altitude was X.  You can not just subsititute
the altitude, or any other datum, from a prior time and place it here.
That is simply lying to the client.

&gt;<i> And that is what it presently isn't doing: it is reporting that altitude or
</I>&gt;<i> speed or some other parameter has gone invalid simply because it has seen a
</I>&gt;<i> sentence with a newer timestamp, NOT because it has received information that
</I>&gt;<i> the requested parameter has been invalidated.  The GPS sends:
</I>
The altitude in invalidated because no altitude for the current timestamp
has been seen yet.  To report an old altitude is a lie.  What is a client
to do when the REAL altitude shows up on the current timestamp and it
is different than the LAST altitude reported in the current timestamp.
This will really confuse data logging programs or any program doing its
own calculation on the data.

If you want to smooth/average/hold data then the way to do it is in
the client.  gpsd should not lie about the current data from the GPS.
No data is no data and should be reported as such.
