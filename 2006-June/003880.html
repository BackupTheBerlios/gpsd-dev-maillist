<PRE>&gt;<i> There may be alternate ways to change/track baud rates that are more
</I>&gt;<i> reliable than assuming you can predict the timing. For instance, when
</I>&gt;<i> changing the GPS baud rate, send the command to the GPS and wait for
</I>&gt;<i> the receiver to detect the framing errors indicating that the GPS is
</I>&gt;<i> transmitting at the new speed before commanding the UART to change.
</I>
I think what we are currently working on is not the command that changes
the speed of existing communication between gpsd and the receiver, but the
hunting for correct speed at gpsd startup (autodetection of the speed),
This is more difficult because there is no initial synchronized condition.


&gt;<i> The receiver can detect that the GPS baud rate is different than the
</I>&gt;<i> UART speed because there will be many framing errors in the received
</I>&gt;<i> data.
</I>
One issue that complicates this way of detection is that it is not really
simple to get framing errors communicated to the application in a Unix
system.  Currently they are just ignored.
When you want to look for framing errors, you will have to cater for
parity as well (for example, TSIP adds odd parity to each databyte. 
currently it is first detected at no-parity, then when gpsd recognizes the
TSIP protocol it switches the serial interface to odd parity to be able to
really communicate)


&gt;<i> Looking at what normal data would look like at various baud rates, I
</I>&gt;<i> think it should be possible to directly detect a number of nearby
</I>&gt;<i> speeds and in most cases jump directly to the correct speed. Once on
</I>&gt;<i> the correct speed, detecting and setting correct data, parity and
</I>&gt;<i> stop bits should also be fairly simple.
</I>
Aren't you assuming that you already know the protocol?
I don't think it is that simple to directly detect both an unknown speed
and an unknown protocol (NMEA, SiRF, TSIP, Zodiac etc) from a buffer of
garbage read at an incorrect speed.
However, when you already know it is NMEA it might be possible to guess
the speed.
