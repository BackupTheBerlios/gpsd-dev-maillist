Actually, the only change to our existing logic I'm proposing is from 
&quot;Buffer all, report on every packet, clear at start of cycle&quot; (what 
we have now) to &quot;Buffer all, report on every packet, never clear&quot; 
(what we should have)... and I've already implemented the patch to 
achieve this.  More complete discussion of this was in Eric's white 
paper and my response to that.  All the other stuff about 
interpolating/extrapolating/trying to calculate latency on fix 
calculation and reporting/etc/etc  is a much, much bigger issue (just 
as you describe), but is not the subject of the above debate.

On that topic, I was interested while &quot;test-flying&quot; some GPSd-based 
software against an approved aircraft GPS unit that the position my 
little Holux GM-210 was reporting was about 8 seconds behind the 
aircraft unit's report - approximately 0.4nm at 180kt.... very much 
as discussed in another thread recently.
