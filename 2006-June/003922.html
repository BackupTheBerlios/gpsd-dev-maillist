<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I'll try to play the role of peacemaker here, as it seems to be 
needed.  Many of the misunderstandings here appear to stem from 
breakdowns in communication, so hopefully can be remedied - I don't 
think we're actually on opposite sides on this issue, for all that it 
might appear so to any casual observer.

I am not the only person to report problems with the current 
buffering logic, and that is what I'm trying to fix.  Bear in mind 
that the broken behaviour from the buffer-clearing with NMEA devices 
is something that manifested in recent (2.30+?) releases of GPSd.  My 
intent here is to preserve the usefulness of GPSd in an everyday 
context, thereby making it more likely that GPS software developers 
will want to use it, rather than less.

&gt;<i>You keep saying this, even after Gary Miller and I have repeatedly pointed out
</I>&gt;<i>that (a) claiming to have valid data for this cycle when you only have it for
</I>&gt;<i>the last cycle is *not* a mere theoretical problem, it's a flat-out lie, and
</I>&gt;<i>(b) that lie *could get people killed*.
</I>
I'm prepared to accept (a).  (b) is something of a hyperbolic 
statement - anyone fool enough to trust their lives to the 
sub-2-second accuracy of open source software which they have not 
personally audited and verified to provide the level of accuracy they 
require, is someone that will do the gene pool a favour by removing 
themselves.

However, (a) is presented as a black and white statement, when there 
are shades of grey in an implementation such as GPSd.  We offer a 
query-based client access method.  Because - by its very nature - 
that allows for a client to query for GPS information at some instant 
other than the very same instant a report comes from the GPS, we will 
always be &quot;lying&quot; to those clients.  We allow them to ask &quot;what is my 
position?&quot;, and GPSd will respond with &quot;your position is X&quot;, even if 
in fact the position *was* X some time in the past second or two, but 
is no longer.  I am prepared to accept that in Watcher mode, we can 
claim &quot;clear at start of cycle&quot; logic to provide a somewhat pedantic 
version of the truth: we can make no such claim for query mode 
clients, because they will not necessarily make requests that return 
the timestamp, therefore they can always delude themselves that 
historical data is present data.  I would not propose doing away with 
query-mode support to resolve this, and I don't expect you would 
either.

&gt;<i>I will not -- repeat *not* -- ship a deceptive, half-assed feel-good
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;solution&quot; to this problem.  Every time you argue that I should, and
</I>&gt;<i>every time you try to slip in your preferred deceptive half-assed
</I>&gt;<i>feel-good &quot;solution&quot; under the oh-so-helpful guise of a fix, you
</I>&gt;<i>diminish your chances that I will trust your judgment in the future.
</I>
I understand your inclination to use that kind of language, but it is 
not warranted.  I am not trying to &quot;slip&quot; something in &quot;under the 
guise&quot; of a fix - I am actually trying to offer users who experience 
the same problems I have, and who would elect to solve it the same 
way (i.e. by reverting to behaviour which gpsd used to exhibit), the 
*option* of doing that.  Most installations of GPSd are not, to my 
knowledge, public servers which offer certified-valid GPS data to 
naive and anonymous clients: instead, I guess (and I acknowledge that 
this is a guess) they are generally private installations where the 
same person who builds and installs the daemon is the one who 
operates (and perhaps even develops) the client programs.

&gt;<i>You crossed a line with the patch you are talking about, when you
</I>&gt;<i>tried for approximately the third time to slide in a choice of default
</I>&gt;<i>I have told you repeatedly I consider *WRONG*, apparently hoping I
</I>&gt;<i>wouldn't notice or wouldn't care enough to reverse it.  That attempt
</I>&gt;<i>went beyond merely annoying and began to seriously piss me off.
</I>
If you had read through the messages to which I attached my patches, 
you would have seen that I explicitly stated *what* the default was, 
and *why* I had chosen it.  The one time I may not have mentioned the 
rationale for the default along with a copy of the patch was the last 
time I posted (at which time I was actually offering the patch to 
someone else) - and even then I still discussed the default setting. 
I'm sorry if you missed what I wrote, but at no time did I attempt to 
deceive you about it: I even mentioned that I would understand if you 
decided to change the default when incorporating the patch.  I 
understand how you could have missed it - it's entirely possible that 
I've missed significant things in some of your messages too: becoming 
this involved in debate, ironically, tends to make oversights or 
misunderstanding more likely.

To show that I am not making this up, here is the text from my 
original posting of the patch:

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>I'd made the default the more user-friendly version, in order to keep 
it simple for the novices who may otherwise be thrown by the 
artificial jitter.  This is purely to save unnecessary repetition of 
questions about jitter on the users mailing list.  I don't see that 
there are any real disadvantages to committing as is, but if my 
choice of default is the only thing getting in the way of this 
getting committed, then feel free to reverse the configure default 
and commit.
&lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt;<i>I've been grappling with the buffering problem for nearly two years.
</I>&gt;<i>Let me say it loud and clear: on this topic I do not accept your
</I>&gt;<i>assumptions, and I do not agree with your value judgments.
</I>
Understood.  Some of what I am working on is, in fact, personal 
experience rather than assumption, and it is clear that I am not 
alone in such experience, but on the value judgement we clearly will 
continue to have differing views.  Such is the joy of open-source 
software. :)

&gt;<i>I'm prepared to accept a per-session J switch *with a default of no
</I>&gt;<i>smoothing* because it enables fine-grained control of the policy and
</I>&gt;<i>allows users to choose their own tradeoff between strict correctness
</I>&gt;<i>and convenience.  It *will* default to strict correctness, and *that*
</I>&gt;<i>*is* *final*.
</I>
OK - understood and accepted.  As my original text stated, I was 
happy for you to change the default.  Are you still prepared to 
accept a combination of per-session logic and a compile-time 
configuration option (with, naturally, the no-smoothing default)?

&gt;<i>The J switch isn't a high priority for me; I have other things to worry
</I>&gt;<i>about, like finally nailing Til's hunt bug.  If you get it done before
</I>&gt;<i>I do, fine; you do good work when you're not riding a hobbyhorse.  If
</I>&gt;<i>you hadn't grossly overplayed your hand on this one issue I'd have
</I>&gt;<i>given you commit privileges some time ago.
</I>
Thanks :)  Actually, I spend more of my time with GPSd flying an 
aeroplane than riding a hobby horse, but I take your point.  Yes, I 
*was* quite determined to get back the usability that GPSd had in the 
past, and was quite surprised by the strength of opposition from 
people for whom the changed logic had made and would make no 
difference... but the points have been made (and made and made) on 
both sides for long enough.  I believe I understand your position, 
and I think you understand mine also.

&gt;<i>I am *not* willing to listen to any more interminable screeds repeating
</I>&gt;<i>arguments I have considered, analyzed, and rejected. My patience is exhausted.
</I>&gt;<i>Write the code or drop the subject.
</I>
OK - attached is the compile-time configuration option with (I 
believe - please check!) the default set to *enabling* 
clear-at-start-of-cycle logic, i.e. no smoothing by default.  This 
means any user who chooses to build GPSd with never-clear logic will 
have to know to do that, and will have to do it explicitly by the use 
of the --disable-casoc configure option.

If that is acceptable as far as it goes, then (when I get the time, 
as I expect it will take considerably more work) I'll start working 
on adding per-client buffer logic selection.

I hope that clears up some of the misunderstandings - especially the 
notion that I was trying to slip anything into the GPSd code under 
the radar.  I've tried to be as open and up-front about my proposed 
patches as possible, and will continue to endeavour to do so.

Regards,
Robin
