OK - well, this is an interesting diversion.  In early April when I 
was doing most of the work on the hotly-debated topic of 
Clear-at-Start-of-Cycle vs. Never-Clear, I was using a Holux GM-210 
with a Prolific driver (that was a couple of years old) connected to 
an iBook G4.  I'm now using the very same Holux GM-210 with the 
latest (as of a few weeks ago, anyway) Prolific driver connected to 
the same iBook G4.  What's interesting is: my GPS always *used* to be 
identified by GPSd as an NMEA data source, and that's the way it 
worked.  Now, however, it identifies quite clearly as a SiRF-II 
binary device, and that's now the way it behaves.  Here's the -D 4 
output at the end of the startup sequence:

gpsd: Selecting SiRF-II binary driver...
gpsd: Requesting periodic ecef reports...
gpsd: Writing SiRF control type a6: a0 a2 00 08 a6 00 02 01 00 00 00

00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 89 b0 b3
gpsd: unflagging descriptor 4 in open_device
gpsd: closing GPS=/dev/tty.usbserial (4)

What it used to do was select the NMEA driver... but now I can't even 
seem to make it do that by disabling all other drivers (this is 
probably because the Holux has now been init'd into SiRF-II binary 
mode by gpsd, and will not just revert to NMEA without being told to 
do so).

I'd actually like to try reverting it for two reasons:

1) I want to test that the -c option for which I just created a patch 
creates the correct kind of jitter from the NMEA stream I used to 
get, and
2) I want to prove that I wasn't imagining that I used to get HDOP, 
VDOP and PDOP from the GPS/GPSd, whereas I now only get HDOP.

Unfortunately, my attempts to switch it back to NMEA have not met 
with much success.  Obviously running the daemon configured without 
the other drivers didn't do the trick, since it didn't know how to 
talk to it in the language it's currently speaking.

So I went back to the list archives - bingo!  run &quot;sirfmon 
/dev/tty.usbserial&quot;, and issue an &quot;n&quot; command.

Except... no dice.  Running &quot;sirfmon /dev/tty.usbserial&quot; just sits 
there (i.e. on the blank line after hitting enter) - the interface 
doesn't appear at all.  This is with gpsd not running, and occurs 
whether I run sirfmon as root or not.  Then I discovered that if I 
run sirfmon with no command line parameters while gpsd *is* running, 
then it appears to connect to something and I get the monitor 
interface... but unfortunately, all the &quot;n&quot; command does at that 
point is cause sirfmon to exit: it's quite clear that the GPS itself 
is still running in SiRF binary  mode.

Interestingly (slightly), the &quot;sirfmon /dev/tty.usbserial&quot; command 
does notice (returns an error &quot;Device not configured&quot; and immediately 
quits) when I unplug the GPS unit, and it returns a &quot;No such file or 
directory&quot; and quits if I try to start it without the unit 
connected... but beyond that, it doesn't seem able to communicate 
directly with the unit.

So... any ideas what my options are?  Any reason why sirfmon should 
fail to run on Mac OS X?

Aside from that, I don't mind *too* much, except I would rather like 
to see VDOP and PDOP reappear (since the unit was quite capable of 
doing those in NMEA)... to the SiRF binary experts, is there a way to 
ask it to send that info as well?  It would be great to see some 
indication of vertical uncertainty again.  I see in the notes that 
&quot;When using SiRF chips, the VDOP/TDOP/GDOP figures and associated 
error estimates are computed by gpsd rather than reported by the 
chip&quot;, but in my case it seems those are not even computed by gpsd - 
I always see zeroes.

It may be that the only solution will be to do what someone posted on 
the davisnetworks Wiki when a BU-303 did the same thing: unplug it 
for a few days and just hope it will revert, and then build GPSd 
without SiRF-II support and hope that will prevent it sending the 
SiRF-II initialisation commands that changed the connection mode in 
the first place.

As an aside, I'm almost certain that the only thing that has changed 
to cause this behaviour are my Prolific drivers, since as far as I 
can see there hasn't been a single change which affected the 
initialisation/detection routines since back when it just played NMEA 
... yes, I just went through a whole svn diff from revision 3279 to 
present.

Presumably they previous drivers did something bad to outgoing data, 
so the init routines never did what they were written to do, and now 
that the drivers work better, the init routines in GPSd can tell the 
SiRF chipset to talk &quot;native&quot; to it.

If anyone has any other ideas on what to try, or suggestions on how 
to get sirfmon to work, that would be most welcome!

Cheers,
Robin
