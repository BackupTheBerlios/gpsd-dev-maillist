Not to be belligerent, but I don't buy it.

Pull-mode clients shouldn't NEED to know about cycles... because we 
pretty much invented them.  Yes, the GPS returns a timestamp along 
with data in certain sentences, and it is certainly open to a 
*client* to decide that it only wants to use data from the very 
latest timestamp... however, the very simplest GPSd client connecting 
to GPSd could just connect once, make one query to find out &quot;where 
are we and how are we moving?&quot;, and that's that.  By insisting on 
discarding data at a time we've arbitrarily decided to call the 
&quot;start of cycle&quot;, we destroy that functionality.  Note that there is 
a HUGELY important distinction I'm trying (repeatedly) to draw here: 
I'm not saying that GPSd should ever return *explicitly* invalidated 
data to a client.  For example, the following would be WRONG:

GPS-&gt;gpsd: track=090
GPS-&gt;gpsd: track=UNKNOWN
client-&gt;gpsd: track?
gpsd-&gt;client: track=90

That is not what I'm saying we should do: I'm saying we should not 
act as if a new timestamp *implicitly* invalidates data not included 
in the sentence that just arrived with the new timestamp... because 
there doesn't seem to be any actual evidence that it should.

&gt;<i>Push vs. pull is pretty much irrelevant here.  In either case, if you want to
</I>&gt;<i>hold old data, you can do so in the client -- whereas, if the daemon were
</I>&gt;<i>to hold data by default, it would be impossible to tell when it was stale.
</I>
I would agree if there were any additional &quot;holding&quot; going on - but 
there isn't.  New sentences overwrite all the data received in 
previous sentences of the same type (and any matching data from 
different types of sentences), and any interruption to the flow of 
sentences (either through loss of fix or disconnection of GPS) 
immediately prevents GPSd from returning old data.  It is only our 
decision that a new timestamp implicitly invalidates all previous fix 
data which is at issue here.

We have several layers here before we even look at the logic internal 
to the client:

1) input from GPS
2) ongoing storage of fix data
3) responding to clients
4) libgps

We already have filtering logic in step 3 which maintains the 
integrity of our responses to the client: regardless of whether or 
not we clear at start of cycle, no response will ever be sent which 
includes old data that has been invalidated by an appropriate 
sentence from the GPS, or including old data despite the loss of the 
GPS fix or the GPS connection.  My argument is that we should not 
*discard* data between steps 1 and 2 when unrelated data arrives with 
a new timestamp.

&gt;<i>You are still free to submit a patch that implements selection of a
</I>&gt;<i>no-clear policy.  But that will not be the default.
</I>
Well, you're the boss.  What bothers me a little here is that none of 
the people arguing against me have actually suffered from the 
problem, and nor do they stand to lose anything by adopting my 
solution.  You have a directory of test data, but I don't believe 
you've tried running it through either the patched or the unpatched 
version, whereas I have a working GPS unit that actually returns the 
kind of data in question.  The only people affected by our choice 
here are those with non-binary devices, and they stand only to lose 
data from the decision to clear-at-start-of-cycle.  What's more, the 
current CASOS logic DOESN'T DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO.  The timestamp 
checking and updating logic is missing from the GGA parser 
altogether, so if the unit in question has GGA at the start of the 
cycle, then what we currently have is &quot;clear in the middle of the 
cycle&quot;, and we're ALWAYS returning both old data and 
incorrectly-invalidated NaNs (i.e. the data from the GGA received at 
the start of the cycle is discarded when the RMC arrives later in the 
same cycle).

In summary, we have an academic argument to support an existing logic 
that - even if we accept it is better in theory, is currently broken 
in practice - running against a real-world-based argument with a 
working fix in active deployment... why does the real world suddenly 
lose out?

But I think I'm making too much of this, for which I apologise... 
it's hard to relinquish a position that I've been arguing for, when 
the solution could easily be to treat BOTH positions as correct 
(depending on user expectations or requirements).  I don't object in 
principle to CaSoS logic being an option, although I think very few 
people will actually want it (no-one yet has: remember, it doesn't 
currently work, but no-one has asked for it).  Indeed, I will very 
happily write a command-line switch to ENABLE CaSoS, with &quot;never 
clear&quot; as the default.  Why should the default matter?  Because 
NON-EXPERT users will generally use as few command-line switches as 
they can get away with to get it working, and those are the same 
users that will be baffled by the artificial jitter introduced by 
CaSoS (and also, on account of willingness to invest in 
better-quality equipment, are much more likely to have an &quot;old&quot; unit 
that is adversely affected by that logic).  On the other hand, the 
expert users will generally figure out *exactly* what switches to use 
to get *exactly* the behaviour they want... and if they want all data 
invalidated at start-of-cycle, then they can choose that.

As I say, I'll very happily write the patch for that... is that 
acceptable?  Beyond that, I have no objections to a release. :)

Cheers,
Robin
