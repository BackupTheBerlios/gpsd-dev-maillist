<PRE>Robin L Darroch &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">robin at spade-men.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Otherwise, we're stuck trying to fix a theoretical argument instead 
</I>&gt;<i> of a real problem.
</I>
You keep saying this, even after Gary Miller and I have repeatedly pointed out
that (a) claiming to have valid data for this cycle when you only have it for
the last cycle is *not* a mere theoretical problem, it's a flat-out lie, and
(b) that lie *could get people killed*.

I will not -- repeat *not* -- ship a deceptive, half-assed feel-good
&quot;solution&quot; to this problem.  Every time you argue that I should, and
every time you try to slip in your preferred deceptive half-assed
feel-good &quot;solution&quot; under the oh-so-helpful guise of a fix, you
diminish your chances that I will trust your judgment in the future.

You crossed a line with the patch you are talking about, when you
tried for approximately the third time to slide in a choice of default
I have told you repeatedly I consider *WRONG*, apparently hoping I
wouldn't notice or wouldn't care enough to reverse it.  That attempt
went beyond merely annoying and began to seriously piss me off.

I've been grappling with the buffering problem for nearly two years.
Let me say it loud and clear: on this topic I do not accept your
assumptions, and I do not agree with your value judgments.

I'm prepared to accept a per-session J switch *with a default of no
smoothing* because it enables fine-grained control of the policy and
allows users to choose their own tradeoff between strict correctness
and convenience.  It *will* default to strict correctness, and *that*
*is* *final*.

The J switch isn't a high priority for me; I have other things to worry
about, like finally nailing Til's hunt bug.  If you get it done before 
I do, fine; you do good work when you're not riding a hobbyhorse.  If
you hadn't grossly overplayed your hand on this one issue I'd have
given you commit privileges some time ago.

I am *not* willing to listen to any more interminable screeds repeating 
arguments I have considered, analyzed, and rejected. My patience is exhausted.
Write the code or drop the subject.
