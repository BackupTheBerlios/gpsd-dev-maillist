<PRE>&gt;<i>I have no problem if there is a new way to request a full data snapshot.
</I>&gt;<i>That makes a lot of sense and would enable a simple client to simply
</I>&gt;<i>poll current data.  My problem is more with touching the streaming
</I>&gt;<i>data or changing the current data flow in ways that will unexpectedly
</I>&gt;<i>break existing apps.  Adding to the current framework is good, changing
</I>&gt;<i>it in a way that will break existing apps should only be done very
</I>&gt;<i>deliberately.
</I>
Careful about making claims of changes that will &quot;break existing 
apps&quot; - remember, no-one who hasn't downloaded and built from SVN in 
the past &lt;24hrs has a daemon which does clear-at-start-of-cycle 
correctly... so I think it's pretty fair to say that no existing app 
could depend on CaSoC, or it would be broken already.

&gt;<i>If we add a new command, or option, to do this, then we need to be very
</I>&gt;<i>explicit about what data we will cache, for how long, and under what
</I>&gt;<i>conditions.  One big problem is when and how to expire data.  How long
</I>&gt;<i>should an altitude be held before being tossed?  How long would sats be
</I>&gt;<i>held before being tossed?  Clearly they can not be the same time since
</I>&gt;<i>some NMEA only provides altitude ever few seconds and sats every minute.
</I>&gt;<i>Depending on the application I see that some apps may want very short
</I>&gt;<i>or very long timeouts so this should also be adjustable.
</I>
Timeouts and such really aren't the issue here, and raising them 
makes the design question unnecessarily complicated: we have two 
straightforward options (and I think we're pretty close to getting 
both properly supported at some level) - those are 
Clear-at-Start-of-Cycle and Never-Clear.  Never-Clear means just 
that: we never arbitrarily clear data - we simply replace it when it 
is replaced or invalidate it when it is explicitly invalidated (i.e. 
by loss of fix or loss of GPS connection, or when a sentence 
including that parameter arrives with that parameter blank). 
Clear-at-Start-of-Cycle, now that it is fixed, will clear all 
gps-&gt;fix data (note that this is not the same as ALL received data) 
whenever a new timestamp is received.  Satellite data is already 
handled as &quot;never clear&quot;, because it is not part of the gps-&gt;fix 
structure.

&gt;<i>Then we need to add the complexity of under what conditions would data
</I>&gt;<i>be tossed early?  Like when the GPS is unplugged.
</I>
That currently invalidates all data at the output layer of GPSd. 
Although the data is still stored (using either Never Clear OR Clear 
at Start of Cycle) until the appropriate trigger arrives to clear it 
- which it never will if the GPS has been unplugged, it is never 
returned to clients.

&gt;<i>I am most nervous about adding complexity to the core functions that we
</I>&gt;<i>already know are hard to get just right.  IMHO gpsd should be as lean
</I>&gt;<i>and mean as we can make it so we can be sure it is correct and robust.
</I>
Agreed - this is why we can't use complicated designs like 
timeouts... but there is no need to use such things anyway.

&gt;<i>It seems to me that if someone is writing a really simple client then
</I>&gt;<i>they would be using libgps or similar.  THey do not want to hassle with
</I>&gt;<i>the already non-trvial gpsd protocol.  They just want to link in a nice
</I>&gt;<i>library and pull what they need out of it.
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;<i>  So we should also
</I>&gt;<i>consider a secondary daemon that could be used as a proxy cache for gpsd
</I>&gt;<i>data.  As a standalone daemon it would be much easier to audit than
</I>&gt;<i>mashing more into gpsd.
</I>
This is certainly a possibility, but is best suited for handling such 
requests as data smoothing/interpolation/extrapolation that come up 
and are beyond the scope of the basic buffer-clearing question... 
that's if we decide we're going to try to provide such extended 
features at all.  This might be a good way of (for example) 
permitting a client to request only one report per fix, with the 
associated cycle-time delay, or to request on-demand 
inter/extrapolated data... but let's look at that another day. :)
