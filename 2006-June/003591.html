<PRE>Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; This sounds ominous... I was hoping my post would have lead to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; realisation that &quot;Buffer all, report on every packet, never clear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data&quot; is the best way to go, thereby helping you to commit my patch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that once you discuss this, people (in this case Dan
</I>&gt;<i> Oetting) invariably step up to bring up the point of latency, and how nice
</I>&gt;<i> it would be if that would be handled well.
</I>&gt;<i> Stuff like interpolation, extrapolation, etc.  See the message of May 23.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This then makes others realize that it is more complicated than one would
</I>&gt;<i> think, and put the whole issue on the TODO list again.
</I>
Heh.  I said back at the beginning of this conversation that the 
data-management problem was a bigger can of worms than anybody (but me) 
realized.  The cycle you're describing doesn't surprise me at all.

I'm taking the approach of writing the rationale in HACKING before
modifying the code so that, if and when we change it, the reasons will be
carefully thought out and on the record so our successors don't have
to recapitulate this controversy.

Robin Darroch: your zeal is commendable, but you're pushing to apply a fix
before I'm certain we understand all the implications.  This is why you
don't have commit access yet -- I prefer commits to be buffered through 
people like Gary Miller who I trust to be paranoid and cautious.

&gt;<i> So yes, it would be nice to have buffering (IMHO) but it can only be done
</I>&gt;<i> when the issue of latency is marked as &quot;won't solve&quot; first.
</I>
OK, this is a ukase from the tsar: I'm not willing to hardwire that policy 
decision into the daemon.  

Some sort of buffer/no-buffer mode switch might be acceptable, but I
fear the buffering implementation would be fertile ground for subtle
bugs.  The default would therefore remain no buffering as it is now.
You choose buffering, you take your chances with the latency and any
implementation bugs.
 
&gt;<i> I think that with some careful coding it should be possible to ship the
</I>&gt;<i> correct timestamp with the data.
</I>&gt;<i> I.E. not the current time, but the time that accompanied the data when it
</I>&gt;<i> was received from the GPS.  this supposedly is the time-of-fix.
</I>
For SiRF-II and other devices that report all fix data in a single
packet, we already have this behavior.  It doesn't help.  By that I mean
that knowing the timestamp on stale data is good does nothing to
simplify the data-management problem.

&gt;<i> People that want to have &quot;current position&quot; of a moving object and are
</I>&gt;<i> willing to extrapolate from earlier readings can then do so in the client
</I>&gt;<i> application.  We should not do this in gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i> (the ability to extrapolate depends on the availability of a synchronized
</I>&gt;<i> clock.  such applications should require the installation and
</I>&gt;<i> configuration of ntpd)
</I>
Agreed.  The HACKING file reflects this decision.
