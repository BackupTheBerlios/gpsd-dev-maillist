I haven't tried. But based on:
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;A 50ms delay between the $PSRF send and the baud change seems  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to do the trick.&quot;
</I>I would guess that this hasn't been thoroughly tested. What if the  
GPS was set to 300 baud before the change? 50ms isn't enough time to  
push out 2 bytes. At 4800 baud you would get to send 24 bytes. The  
first example of a $PSRF command I found was &quot;  
$PSRF100,0,9600,8,1,0*0C&quot; (exactly 24 bytes if you don't count the  
&lt;CR&gt; which also needs to be sent before the transmit baud rate  
changes). How long is the command that GPSD sends out?

Even if you recompute the delay based on the current baud rate and  
the length of the transmitted command, there is still the possibility  
that the transmit buffer is already full. If for instance,  
differential input is being sent to the GPS, you would not know how  
long it will be before your command even enters the queue.

Since you can't know for certain when the command will be sent I was  
suggesting the alternate strategy of waiting for feedback that the  
command was processed. That feedback comes in the form of a change in  
baud rate of the received data.

&gt;<i> Your proposed solutions all involve complicating the autobauding logic
</I>&gt;<i> a lot.  That makes me nervous; I'd rather stick with techniques that
</I>&gt;<i> are simple, stupid, robust, and don't entroduce new feature  
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> and edge cases.
</I>
Cautious is good but don't be paranoid. The autobaud detection looks  
like just another protocol detection. Whenever the receiver has to  
hunt for a recognized protocol it should also be hunting for the  
signatures that indicate the baud rate is wrong (proper care can be  
taken to prevent changing the baud rate before the protocol can be  
detected and insure that all expected baud rates would have been  
detected before giving up). Even if by a fluke we miss the correct  
baud rate all is not lost because if there is no signature that the  
baud rate should be lower and a valid protocol cannot be decoded then  
the correct baud rate must be higher so we step up and try again.

The world isn't perfect and we should expect that the baud rate of  
the GPS receiver could become different than what  GPSd had  
previously locked onto. It could be the user manually changing the  
baud rate, a power interruption or firmware glitch resetting the GPS  
to it's defaults or the GPS missing the command to change baud rates.  
Being robust includes the ability to handle these unusual situations  
by reinitiating the hunt for the new rate when the receiver finds  
itself lost.
