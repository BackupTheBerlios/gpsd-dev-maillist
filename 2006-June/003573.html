<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> While technically this may be the right thing to do, I am always
</I>&gt;<i> reluctant to add patches that have not been tested and that by design
</I>&gt;<i> will likely break existing applications.  At least one gpsd user
</I>&gt;<i> has True North units in serious production usage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also of concern is how far the effects go.  This new heading addition
</I>&gt;<i> would also need to be made to libgps, cgps, xgps, the doc, etc.  None
</I>&gt;<i> of which can be tested until we get someone with one of these units to
</I>&gt;<i> test it.  Then you have all the third party apps, like gpsdrive that can
</I>&gt;<i> display track but know nothing of heading.  Maybe you can scrounge the
</I>&gt;<i> list archives and attempt to recontact a True North user and get them
</I>&gt;<i> involved first.  We can discuss this all we want but real users with
</I>&gt;<i> real applications always seem to have their own views.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do agree that something like this change needs to be done, but what
</I>&gt;<i> will really force it will be when someone has a GPS that reports track
</I>&gt;<i> and heading and needs both.  Then it needs to be done front to back.
</I>
I fully concur with this analysis.  I agree that the patch seems like the
right thing, but I also want to see some real-world testing with a TNT
device.  We know that the current code, flawed though it may be, was
contributed by an actual TNT user and thus presumptively meets his
actual needs.

So I'm going to dispose of this by adding a known bug to our buglist.

*** True North support confuses track with heading

Robin Darroch has pointed out that the support for the True North
compass device confuses track (course over ground) with heading.
This should probably be fixed.  However, the TNT code was sent 
to us by a TNT user involved in the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge 
and therefore presumably meets actual production needs.  For
this reason, and because separating track froom heading would 
ripple through several places including gps.h and the client
implementations, we're not going to try to fix this until we
have a TNT device (or something else that makes the same
distinction) to test with.
