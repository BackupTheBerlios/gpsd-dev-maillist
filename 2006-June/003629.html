<PRE>For the clients that want to poll because they require infrequent  
data, irregular times or they just want somebody else to do the dirty  
work, there could be a separate facility outside of GPSd. This  
location services daemon could provide additional services such as  
synchronizing the requested data to the clients time, interpolating  
data over several cycles or extrapolating to a future time of  
interest and computing the error estimate for the result.

The location services needs to be handled by a daemon because it  
enables tools that are not persistent processes to use location  
results that would otherwise not be available.

A simple location tagging tool:
	Some event triggers...
	Launch process
	Identify time of event [ie: from network message timestamp]
	read configuration, do setup
	do
		probe location service for delta=(event time - current time)
		wait for timeout
	until response or too many retries.
	do whatever with event
	quit

Note that the client time does not need to be synchronized with the  
GPS time (although the location services daemon does). Time in a  
request can be a delta time +/- several seconds up to a maximum  
configured for the daemon or a GPS time that falls within the same  
window.

Even for persistant processes, this type of polled location service  
will simplify the task of clients whose primary function is something  
other than being an expert GPS data massager.
