Actually, I'm looking in there, and I can't see any NMEA source for 
which my patch will not be an improvement.  All of them use GPGGA, 
GPRMC and/or GPGLL sentences in some order or another, so all will 
suffer from artificial jitter with the existing logic.

</I>
But that's exactly what I'm saying *shouldn't* happen.  Pretending 
that the start of a cycle is a magic time is something that has been 
invented in gpsd, not something inherent in the protocol.

&gt;<i>   So the data reported a second ago is no help during THIS
</I>&gt;<i>second.  If there is no data for THIS second available hen gpsd should
</I>&gt;<i>not invent/interpolate/carry-over old data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If the client wants to do that fine, but the daemon should just report
</I>&gt;<i>what it sees.
</I>
And that is what it presently isn't doing: it is reporting that 
altitude or speed or some other parameter has gone invalid simply 
because it has seen a sentence with a newer timestamp, NOT because it 
has received information that the requested parameter has been 
invalidated.  The GPS sends:

1.......1.......2.......2.......

GPSd currently reports (if receiving other sentences earlier in the 
cycle that don't include that parameter)

1..NaN..1..NaN..2..NaN..2..NaN..

but I suggest that it should report (and mine does report)

1...1...1...1...2...2...2...2...

the latter seems to be a MUCH more honest depiction of what the GPS 
is sending, considering that (as Eric covered comprehensively) it is 
never going to be a practical option to report only

1.......1.......2.......2.......

Of course, what it must never do is report existing data when it HAS 
received information from the GPS that invalidates existing data (or 
if it loses the GPS altogether) - but that logic is already built in 
to the reporting end of GPSd, so we're worrying about a problem at 
the input stage which is handled comprehensively at the output stage.

I still say: never clear. :)
