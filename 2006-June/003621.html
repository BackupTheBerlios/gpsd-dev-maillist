<PRE>Robin L Darroch &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">robin at spade-men.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I hate to reopen the case, but there has to be an appeal process: and 
</I>&gt;<i> here's why.  GPSd supports more than just the W command.  If it 
</I>&gt;<i> supported nothing but Watcher mode clients, I'd accept your argument. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, one of the best things about GPSd is it allows clients to 
</I>&gt;<i> ASK for data.  By keeping &quot;clear at start of cycle&quot; logic, we kill 
</I>&gt;<i> all such attempts to use query-based clients, because they can never 
</I>&gt;<i> know whether they'll be unlucky enough to query just after the start 
</I>&gt;<i> of the cycle or not.  Only PUSHED data delivered under policy 1 can 
</I>&gt;<i> be used to simulate PUSHED data delivered under policy 2 (although it 
</I>&gt;<i> can be a right pain to do so) - but PULLED data delivered under 
</I>&gt;<i> policy 1 is useless.
</I>
I don't buy it.

If the client is lucky (which will always be the case for the 80% of
SiRF devices out there) no problem.

If the client is &quot;unlucky&quot;, this just means they get a response saying
there is no data.  This is the *correct* response, because gpsd cannot
yet deliver valid data in the current cycle.  Holding over data from
the last cycle would be worse than useless, it would be actively
misleading.  The fact that asking half a second later might give
you a response with the same valid data as the previous cycle doesn't
meean it's OK to pretend gpsd knows that before it happens.

Push vs. pull is pretty much irrelevant here.  In either case, if you want to 
hold old data, you can do so in the client -- whereas, if the daemon were
to hold data by default, it would be impossible to tell when it was stale.

You are still free to submit a patch that implements selection of a 
no-clear policy.  But that will not be the default.
