<PRE>There may be alternate ways to change/track baud rates that are more  
reliable than assuming you can predict the timing. For instance, when  
changing the GPS baud rate, send the command to the GPS and wait for  
the receiver to detect the framing errors indicating that the GPS is  
transmitting at the new speed before commanding the UART to change.  
The current 50ms fixed delay works if only the change speed command  
can be in the output buffer at the time and the current UART speed is  
not slower than the default.

If you set a state flag indicating that you are waiting for a speed  
change and don't allow any further output to the GPS until the  
receiver detects and locks on to the new speed you will know that the  
output buffers are empty at the time the receiver changes the UART  
speed (note: the waiting for change flag would need to expire if the  
GPS never changed).

The receiver can detect that the GPS baud rate is different than the  
UART speed because there will be many framing errors in the received  
data. This should trigger a hunt to match the new speed. Having the  
receiver detect speed changes will also allow GPSd to track manual  
speed changes on the GPS and doesn't put you in a bind if the GPS  
doesn't process the change speed request for any reason. A downside  
is that you are guaranteed to miss the next output sentence after the  
change.

A timing independent way to change baud rates would be to block input  
with the CREAD bit, read or flush to insure that there is no more  
buffered input, change the UART baud rate then unblock the input.  
However, a comment I read in one of the USB drivers asks if anybody  
uses the CREAD bit anymore. It may be unfortunate if some drivers  
ignore it or if it's not implemented in the USB hardware.

Looking at what normal data would look like at various baud rates, I  
think it should be possible to directly detect a number of nearby  
speeds and in most cases jump directly to the correct speed. Once on  
the correct speed, detecting and setting correct data, parity and  
stop bits should also be fairly simple. If the hunt is directed by  
the receiver seeing bad data it will continue to hunt until the  
correct settings are found. The only catch would be not allowing the  
system to fall into a short loop that doesn't land on the right  
settings and making sure it's not confused by seeing data from a  
previous speed after the UART speed is changed.
