<PRE>Hi Frank,

The answer to your question(s) comes in three parts:

1) Since you're on Mac OS X, it's possible that your GPS presents as 
not just one but two devices in the /dev directory and - here's the 
important part - they may be handled differently.  For example, my 
GPS shows up as

/dev/tty.usbserial  AND
/dev/cu.usbserial

If I start gpsd or sirfmon using /dev/tty.usbserial, it's not 
reliably able to change between NMEA and SiRF binary modes... 
however, using /dev/cu.usbserial, it seems to work every time.  Also 
note that only one client (the one from which you're issuing the 
command) can be connected for an N=0 or N=1 command to complete 
successfully.

2) The problem with GPSd and NMEA devices is a known issue with the 
existing buffering logic (you can read all about it in the HACKING 
file), but for the moment the lead developer has elected to keep the 
logic as is (changes to that logic could cause problems for 
data-loggers, since an NMEA device could cause GPSd to return two 
sequential O responses with the same timestamp but two different 
values for a given parameter... not an issue for most &quot;user level&quot; 
clients, but could cause a problem for something that requires 
one-to-one matching).  That said, I'm waiting on him to approve and 
commit a patch to make the buffering logic a compile-time option, so 
that users with NMEA devices that prefer the (generally more 
user-friendly) &quot;never-clear&quot; buffering logic can build that in.  I've 
attached the patch to this message (if you're happy building from an 
SVN repository and applying patches).  The patch is against revision 
3339.

3) Since you're on a Mac, if you don't want the hassles of the above, 
feel free to download and use my Universal Binary build of gpsd - 
configured with never-clear buffering logic.  It works perfectly with 
KisMAC (which, incidentally, sends a compound query to GPSd when it 
needs data), and every other client I've had a chance to test with it 
(gpsdrive, cgps, xgps, gps2geX, and one I'm working on right now). 
You can download my binary release from 
<A HREF="http://www.grandhighwizard.net/gpsdx.html">http://www.grandhighwizard.net/gpsdx.html</A>

Incidentally, if you decide to go with SVN+patch, you should be right 
with the defaults, but check the summary at the end of the 
./configure - it should indicate that Clear at Start of Cycle is set 
to &quot;NO&quot;... if in doubt, use the --disable-casoc switch with 
./configure.

Cheers,
Robin

</I>&gt;<i>It's a Sirf II receiver, that defaults to NMEA.  gpsd has NEVER been 
</I>&gt;<i>able to detect or switch it to Sirf II, even-though the Palm &amp; 
</I>&gt;<i>Windows utilities are able to.  gpsd always detects it as a NMEA 
</I>&gt;<i>receiver.  First, if there's anything I can do to help that change, 
</I>&gt;<i>PLEASE let me know.  I'm willing to even loan it out, if need be, 
</I>&gt;<i>for testing, etc.  I think I would have better results with it in 
</I>&gt;<i>Sirf mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Kismac (an open source Mac Wardriving application) often reports no 
</I>&gt;<i>fix, or incorrect data (typically 1-2 seconds behind).  I don't know 
</I>&gt;<i>what commands it is using to get data from gpsd, but am wiling to 
</I>&gt;<i>look at the source code, if need be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>'cgps' &amp; 'xgps' are not consistent between the two.  cgps flashes a 
</I>&gt;<i>fix &amp; location once per second, then no fix or location, until the 
</I>&gt;<i>next second.  It was tough to catch the fix for the screenshot. 
</I>&gt;<i>xgps has a constant location &amp; NO fix, but flashes 3D Fix &amp; no 
</I>&gt;<i>location, once per second.  I have screenshots of this, linked 
</I>&gt;<i>below.  I would have expected cgps &amp; xgps to produce the same 
</I>&gt;<i>results....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've tested with a Mac tool called GPSUtility that talks to the 
</I>&gt;<i>receiver in NMEA.  It has a constant location &amp; fix.  It also has an 
</I>&gt;<i>output window, showing what it's receiving from the receiver.  Note 
</I>&gt;<i>that the output from the receiver is probably set to what gpsd 
</I>&gt;<i>configured.  gpsd had been run, and I'm assuming it set what 
</I>&gt;<i>statements/info the GPS would spit out in NMEA mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've included links to screenshots of cgps, xgps &amp; GPSUtility.  I've 
</I>&gt;<i>also included the text output of gpsd &amp; GPSUtility, when running.  
</I>&gt;<i>The GPS is stationary on a window sill, during these tests.

</I>&gt;<i>I'm able to easily build the released tarballs.  I can checkout SVN, 
</I>&gt;<i>but the autogen.sh script doesn't work for me (build environment 
</I>&gt;<i>issues).  I'm willing to run whatever tests or logs that will help 
</I>&gt;<i>in resolving this.  I'm also willing to patch the release tarballs, 
</I>&gt;<i>to try updates in SVN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ultimately, I'd like for gpsd to change it to Sirf mode, even if I 
</I>&gt;<i>have to pass a command to gpsd to make that happen.  This happening 
</I>&gt;<i>automatically would be GREAT.  Before that happens, there appears to 
</I>&gt;<i>be something wrong with either what the GPS is giving gpsd, in NMEA 
</I>&gt;<i>mode, or the way gpsd is interpreting the NMEA received from the GPS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>BTW - The GPS retains mode (NMEA/Sirf), as long as it has power.  
</I>&gt;<i>It's normal installation is in a vehicle, and it only has power when 
</I>&gt;<i>I flip a power switch.  The mode will default back to NMEA, without 
</I>&gt;<i>power for a few minutes.  I don't recall if I've set the GPS to 
</I>&gt;<i>Sirf, and then tried to use it with gpsd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for taking the time to read through this.  Let me know what I can do!
