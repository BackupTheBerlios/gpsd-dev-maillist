Fair enough.  I never saw GPSd successfully switch my unit to SiRF 
binary mode until quite recently (within the past two months), and I 
think that must have had something to do with installing the new 
Prolific drivers, since nothing else significant changed in that area 
of GPSd in the same time frame as far as I can tell.

&gt;<i>I HAVE read the long discussion about the NMEA buffering/CASC

</I>&gt;<i>in the past for me, with the SAME GPS &amp; the same apps.  The fact 
</I>&gt;<i>that NMEA output (as set by gpsd) does work with other apps, tells 
</I>&gt;<i>me that NMEA output is good, and I would expect it to work with gpsd.
</I>
The clear-at-start-of-cycle logic was not, as far as I can tell, 
implemented until the past couple of release versions: I also saw 
consistent fix behaviour up until then... but I wasn't building from 
SVN until after release 2.32, and didn't really start delving into 
the source until it started breaking for me and I wanted to fix it 
(hence my involvement in the buffer-clearing debate).

&gt;<i>The n=1 command just causes gpsd to return n=0.  It has no effect. 
</I>&gt;<i>I haven't looked at the code, but I suspect if an &quot;alternate mode&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>(as defined in the man pages) is not detected at startup, then gpsd 
</I>&gt;<i>will not change to any alternate mode - it doesn't know which of the 
</I>&gt;<i>MANY modes to change to.
</I>
I've had it return N=0 for N=1 and vice versa, simply because I had 
another client connected at the time, but it subsequently allowed me 
to change when I disconnnected the other client... but I understand 
that probably isn't your issue.  What does your I command return?

&gt;<i>Thanks for the offer to build.  I prefer to roll my own, ESPECIALLY 
</I>&gt;<i>for testing purposes.  That way I KNOW how/what/when/where!  It 
</I>&gt;<i>keeps my testing consistent  :^)
</I>
Of course.

&gt;<i>Also, shouldn't xgps &amp; cgps exhibit the same behavior?  If they're 
</I>&gt;<i>supposed to represent what gpsd is reporting, as a debugging tool, 
</I>&gt;<i>they are reporting different things.
</I>
I don't know that they handle empty fields the same way, so perhaps 
not - I don't use xgps much at all, and haven't got into the source 
code behind the scenes, so can't say much more about it.

&gt;<i>The reason I included pictures/logs, was so HOPEFULLY someone would 
</I>&gt;<i>review them, and discuss what/why it was happening.  I believe they 
</I>&gt;<i>may have some bearing on the recent debate of buffering, etc.  I 
</I>&gt;<i>have a pretty strong feeling that gpsd is NOT handling the NMEA 
</I>&gt;<i>output from my GPS, properly.
</I>
That does look to be the case: the only sentence from which it 
appears to raise the mode is GSA... but RMC and GGA both show ? in 
the mode field.  Your cycle appears to start with a GGA, but the RMC 
comes later than the GSA... so CaSoC alone probable isn't enough to 
explain what you're seeing... and reviewing the following from your 
gpsd run log, I can't actually see why the RMC parser should be 
dropping the mode - that's only meant to happen if the second field 
is &quot;V&quot;, and it's not - it appears to be A every time.

AHHHH... hang on... you've got the release version of 2.33, haven't 
you?  That may well explain it: because of a line that wasn't removed 
from the release version, 2.33 release clears the buffer after every 
timestamped sentence (because it resets the last timestamp seen every 
time)... so it may be clearing the mode... however, I'm still not 
sure that explains why it isn't keeping at least 2D mode status from 
the other sentences.  There doesn't look to be anything about your 
GPS output which would suggest it shouldn't parse, but I haven't 
spent long enough poring over it to say for sure.  Either way, the 
answer probably lies between the above raw NMEA output, nmea_parse.c 
and libgpsd_core.c (if you want to chase it through the code 
yourself).

&gt;<i>   They may prove a point one way or another in the buffer 
</I>&gt;<i>discussion......  I'm not sure anyone has looked at them yet...... 
</I>&gt;<i>I was hoping someone would chime in what what might be able to be 
</I>&gt;<i>done to allow gpsd to better detect my gps as Sirf.  Then I could 
</I>&gt;<i>forget about NMEA with gpsd.
</I>
Perhaps, but from the point of view of GPSd, I don't think *we* 
should forget about NMEA with GPSd... there may still be a number of 
cases where that is the preferred or only option, and we have to aim 
to support it as well as possible.

Cheers,
Robin

P.S.  I understand that from the point of your own testing, you want 
the &quot;roll your own&quot; version, but I'd be interested to know if my 
binary version works better for you.  It is quite specific in the 
ReadMe file about what it installs and where, so it's quite easy to 
purge it from your system altogether when you're done testing it.
