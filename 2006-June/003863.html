Darn right it does. I've said I was guessing all along.

Where does this guess come from? I've found that adding a bit of a
delay when changing speeds helps. So have others. But the magic amount
of time doesn't seem to be constant. It seems to be wholly unnecessary
changing between 38k4 and 57k6, but seems quite important changing to
or from 4800. Certainly I got better results out of my code by adding
a delay.

Considering that the PL2303 (and probably others) are goofing about
with their internal clocks to effect the speed change, and considering
that they have on-chip buffers of some size, it doesn't seem
unreasonable to suspect the speed and buffer size as being having some
influence over how long it actually takes for the port to change
speed.

The nice thing about gpsd being open source is that you're welcome to
look at it, call bullshit if you see or smell any, and in return for
that privilege, you're encouraged to provide guidance on a better way
to do something. ;)

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
