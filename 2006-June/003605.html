<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The altitude in invalidated because no altitude for the current timestamp
</I>&gt;<i> has been seen yet.  To report an old altitude is a lie.
</I>
I was preparing a whole long response to Robin's post on this topic, but 
Gary has put the central objection in a nutshell here.  If we held data
from a previous cycle, we would be pretending that the daemon knows
something it doesn't.  We would, in fact, be lying to the client.

Yes, GPSes sometimes lie this way when they perform dead-reckoning or
interpolation in the absence of a good fix.  That is not a warrant
for gpsd to add another layer of guesswork and prevarication on top
of what the GPS tells it.

&gt;<i>                                                    What is a client
</I>&gt;<i> to do when the REAL altitude shows up on the current timestamp and it
</I>&gt;<i> is different than the LAST altitude reported in the current timestamp.
</I>&gt;<i> This will really confuse data logging programs or any program doing its
</I>&gt;<i> own calculation on the data.
</I>
I hadn't thought of this possibility.  It's a powerful argument for Gary's
position, but not the conclusive one; see below.

&gt;<i> If you want to smooth/average/hold data then the way to do it is in
</I>&gt;<i> the client.  gpsd should not lie about the current data from the GPS.
</I>&gt;<i> No data is no data and should be reported as such.
</I>
Consider a choice between two interpretations of the GPS posting a bit of
data:

(1) This data is valid at the time of the fix the GPS reported.

(2) This data is valid until the GPS sends new data or a mode 
    indication that invalidates it.

Gary is advocating policy (1), Robin policy (2).

Here's the showstopper, the conclusive argument.  Data delivered according
to policy (1) can be interpreted to simulate policy (2), *but the reverse
is not true*.  That is, under policy (2) we could not distinguish in the 
output of gpsd between data reported and data held.  But under policy(1)
the client is free to perform whatever data smoothing it likes.

Case closed: gpsd will continue to clear data at start of cycle.  

I will write up an explanation for the HACKING file.

Robin, I will consider a patch to either (a) implement data holding in
libgps, or (b) enable data holding in the daemon on an explicit command
shipped by libps.  I would prefer the former approach in order to keep
the daemon as simple as possible.
