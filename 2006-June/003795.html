<PRE>Paranoia pays.  I was almost, but not quite, paranoid enough...

The reason I came up with a hypothesis about Til's hunt bug so fast is
that I was half-expecting some problem very like this to manifest when
I wrote the original packet-sniffer code.  

This is why I tried to armor those baud transitions with flushes and
drains -- and, according to Michael R. Davis, I did manage to avoid a
freeze bug in the pl2303 or its driver that analogous code in openwrt
trips over. But, as we now see, I didn't do a completely effective job
of armoring.

gpsfake was another consequence of paranoia -- a sturdy
regression-test framework was part of my plan almost from when I
originally took the lead.  However, one lesson from Til's bug 
is that gpsfake is not quite good enough -- it can't reproduce
the sorts of malformations in the packet-sniffer's input that 
fluky serial hardware sometimes generates.

I suppose I could add the ability to generate a noise prefix,
but without some better theory of the *sorts* of noise serial
hardware introduces,  I'd probably be probing the wrong region
of the state space.  Anybody have suggestions about this? 

As a separate issue, gpsfake still seems to be occasionally triggering
a subtle hang bug in gpsd even now that we've addressed the fuser
problem; see my exchanges with Gary Miller on his strace outputs.
That probably ought to be next on the target list after Til's bug.
