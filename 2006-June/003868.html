<PRE>I am aware of both devices on the Mac, and both provide the same  
results.  I discussed them almost a year ago, when I was more active  
in this project.  It doesn't matter which device I select, gpsd  
cannot detect the gps as Sirf.

I HAVE read the long discussion about the NMEA buffering/CASC  
debate.  That's what made me chime in.  My point was NMEA DID work in  
the past for me, with the SAME GPS &amp; the same apps.  The fact that  
NMEA output (as set by gpsd) does work with other apps, tells me that  
NMEA output is good, and I would expect it to work with gpsd.

The n=1 command just causes gpsd to return n=0.  It has no effect.  I  
haven't looked at the code, but I suspect if an &quot;alternate mode&quot; (as  
defined in the man pages) is not detected at startup, then gpsd will  
not change to any alternate mode - it doesn't know which of the MANY  
modes to change to.

Thanks for the offer to build.  I prefer to roll my own, ESPECIALLY  
for testing purposes.  That way I KNOW how/what/when/where!  It keeps  
my testing consistent  :^)

Also, shouldn't xgps &amp; cgps exhibit the same behavior?  If they're  
supposed to represent what gpsd is reporting, as a debugging tool,  
they are reporting different things.

The reason I included pictures/logs, was so HOPEFULLY someone would  
review them, and discuss what/why it was happening.  I believe they  
may have some bearing on the recent debate of buffering, etc.  I have  
a pretty strong feeling that gpsd is NOT handling the NMEA output  
from my GPS, properly.  They may prove a point one way or another in  
the buffer discussion......  I'm not sure anyone has looked at them  
yet......  I was hoping someone would chime in what what might be  
able to be done to allow gpsd to better detect my gps as Sirf.  Then  
I could forget about NMEA with gpsd.

&gt;<i> Hi Frank,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The answer to your question(s) comes in three parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Since you're on Mac OS X, it's possible that your GPS presents  
</I>&gt;<i> as not just one but two devices in the /dev directory and - here's  
</I>&gt;<i> the important part - they may be handled differently.  For example,  
</I>&gt;<i> my GPS shows up as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/tty.usbserial  AND
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/cu.usbserial
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I start gpsd or sirfmon using /dev/tty.usbserial, it's not  
</I>&gt;<i> reliably able to change between NMEA and SiRF binary modes...  
</I>&gt;<i> however, using /dev/cu.usbserial, it seems to work every time.   
</I>&gt;<i> Also note that only one client (the one from which you're issuing  
</I>&gt;<i> the command) can be connected for an N=0 or N=1 command to complete  
</I>&gt;<i> successfully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The problem with GPSd and NMEA devices is a known issue with the  
</I>&gt;<i> existing buffering logic (you can read all about it in the HACKING  
</I>&gt;<i> file), but for the moment the lead developer has elected to keep  
</I>&gt;<i> the logic as is (changes to that logic could cause problems for  
</I>&gt;<i> data-loggers, since an NMEA device could cause GPSd to return two  
</I>&gt;<i> sequential O responses with the same timestamp but two different  
</I>&gt;<i> values for a given parameter... not an issue for most &quot;user level&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> clients, but could cause a problem for something that requires one- 
</I>&gt;<i> to-one matching).  That said, I'm waiting on him to approve and  
</I>&gt;<i> commit a patch to make the buffering logic a compile-time option,  
</I>&gt;<i> so that users with NMEA devices that prefer the (generally more  
</I>&gt;<i> user-friendly) &quot;never-clear&quot; buffering logic can build that in.   
</I>&gt;<i> I've attached the patch to this message (if you're happy building  
</I>&gt;<i> from an SVN repository and applying patches).  The patch is against  
</I>&gt;<i> revision 3339.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Since you're on a Mac, if you don't want the hassles of the  
</I>&gt;<i> above, feel free to download and use my Universal Binary build of  
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd - configured with never-clear buffering logic.  It works  
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly with KisMAC (which, incidentally, sends a compound query  
</I>&gt;<i> to GPSd when it needs data), and every other client I've had a  
</I>&gt;<i> chance to test with it (gpsdrive, cgps, xgps, gps2geX, and one I'm  
</I>&gt;<i> working on right now). You can download my binary release from  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.grandhighwizard.net/gpsdx.html">http://www.grandhighwizard.net/gpsdx.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Incidentally, if you decide to go with SVN+patch, you should be  
</I>&gt;<i> right with the defaults, but check the summary at the end of the ./ 
</I>&gt;<i> configure - it should indicate that Clear at Start of Cycle is set  
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;NO&quot;... if in doubt, use the --disable-casoc switch with ./ 
</I>&gt;<i> configure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Robin
