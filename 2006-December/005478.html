I fixed this on the plane home yesterday. The Navcom driver was hooked
into packet.c in the wrong place, so it effectively assumed it was the
only DLE-protocol driver.

</I>
Horsepucky! Run with a high debug level and watch the state
transitions. DLE_LEADER was hit, the state machine failed to move to
NAVCOM_???? and dropped back to GROUND_STATE. That was a very strong
indication that the Navcom test was too soon, too greedy or both...

</I>
Consider a 2 second sleep after shipping the last packet?
Consider sending some random junk that won't be parsed but will force
gpsd to finish processing whatever it had?
I wonder if this is some sort of interaction with gpsd's 2 second
i-haven't-seen-any-data-so-i'm-going-offline behaviour (which I really
hate, btw).

&gt;<i> 2) If I build the regression tests on a 64-bit machine, they fail
</I>&gt;<i> weirdly on 32-bit machines, and vice-versa.  Some of these divergences are
</I>&gt;<i> just round-off errors in the low-order parts of trig functions.  Some

Yech.

Oddly enough, many of the binary protocols seem to parse quite nicely
on my 32b machine. My amd64 currently dual-boots win32/bsd64 - i'll
have to do a live-cd or prepare a usb disk to boot bsd32.

Which reminds me: I think the NMEA generator needs to be taught to
output &quot;&quot; instead of &quot;NaN&quot; -  I'm pretty sure that if we don't have
good numbers for a field and we start outputting letters instead,
we're going to have some very confused consumer processes...

&gt;<i> Things are better than they were before I rewrote gpsfake to work

</I>
I'm slowly prodding the bear with a slightly pointy stick; but the
more people we can have working on this, the better.

Some things I thought of while I was prodding Navcom/TSIP and UBX this
past week:
* for each supported protocol, I would like a capture file containing
the smallest number of messages required to express a PVT solution
(error estimates are utterly irrelevant here). iTalk, SiRF, TSIP and
UBX (for example) can all do this in one packet. NMEA needs a few
sentences (GGA,GLL,RMC). Feed this capture into gpsd and you get a
single O message.

* for each supported protocol, I would like a capture file containing
the smallest number of messages required to describe the
active/viewable constellation. iTalk, SiRF, TSIP, and UBX (for
example) can all do this in one packet. NMEA needs a few sentences
(GSA, n* GSV). Feed this capture into gpsd and you get a single Y
message.

* for each supported protocol, I would like a capture file containing
the smallest number of messages required to generate a complete O
message with error models. iTalk, SiRF, TSIP, and UBX (for example)
can probably do this in two or three packets - PVT solution, skyview
and error estimates (if the protocol has such a thing).

* for each supported protocol, I would like a capture file containing
15 minutes of data, with as many different message types supported by
that protocol. That means the usual PVT and satellite messages, plus
raw measurements, almanac, ephemeris, debug output, error messages (if
you can trigger them)... this is not intended for use in general
regression test runs, but rather for more involved hacking.

* i don't trust gpsfake/gpscat - i dislike they way they're trying to
be too clever about recognizing packet types and playing back whole
packets. I spent a while hand-editing capture files until I got
something gpsfake would play back. Because of this, I wrote a couple
of similar utilities in C, but without the smarts. They do the minimum
required to open a serial line and start logging bytes, or read a
binary file and spew into a pty. I will happily make these utilities
available to anyone who wants to get me captures. Think of this as an
independent check of gpsfake/gpscat - much as the logic in sirfmon was
designed to be an independent check of the sirf decode routines in
libgps.
