<PRE>Mick Durkin &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">mick.durkin at saunalahti.fi</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I am trying to bring my driver into line with the latest version of the SVN 
</I>&gt;<i> (4094) and there have been recent changes to the methods and some splitting 
</I>&gt;<i> of information in the header files which have caused me a bit of head 
</I>&gt;<i> scratching.
</I>
My guess is you're reacting to the packet-sniffer context getting broken out
into a new struct gps_packet_t.  The good news for you is that this does
not affect the driver API at all.
 
&gt;<i> Here is how I think it goes, so please guide/correct me if I am wrong:-
</I>
Working...

&gt;<i> 1) If we fire up the daemon in -N mode with &quot;gpsd -N -D1
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/ttyS0&quot;, the only effect compared to normal operation should be
</I>&gt;<i> that it does not go into true daemon mode (and doesn't drop
</I>&gt;<i> privileges?) but otherwise behaves normally.  Using the -N allows us
</I>&gt;<i> to keep control over the code and allow easy exit when testing.
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> 2) Right up front, we scan all compiled drivers in turn to see if
</I>&gt;<i> they support the probe_detect call and trigger that entry point,
</I>&gt;<i> using a free file descriptor (it always seems to be fd = 4 for
</I>&gt;<i> me). If a probe matures, that driver gets the port and we stop
</I>&gt;<i> checking further. If there are no probes supported or none of them
</I>&gt;<i> responds, we will determine the device later by a port scan at
</I>&gt;<i> different baud rates. That activity doesn't concern me here.
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> 3) If we got a good probe, we then issue a subtype probe (if
</I>&gt;<i> supported). This subtype probe should get the version data and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> do some other good things. The arguments of the gpsd_activate()
</I>&gt;<i> function triggering this call are such that there is no configurator
</I>&gt;<i> call triggered at this point.
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> 4) We then sit in a loop, waiting until we have detected a good
</I>&gt;<i> packet in the main parser. When the packet type is known, because we
</I>&gt;<i> have no users, we issue a wrapup call (if supported) to reverse the
</I>&gt;<i> actions of the subtype probe and release the file descriptor (not
</I>&gt;<i> sure about that?).
</I>
Not quite.  The subtype probe isn't supposed to perform any actions
that need to be reversed.  That's the configurator method's job.
The subtype probe is only supposed to elicit a response that tells
us what we're actually looking at.

In one case (SiRF) the subtype it flips the device into binary mode
(because it's the only reliable probe), but this doesn't actually
change the device's reporting in the way that (say) setting static nav
bit or altitude hold would.  The framework code around the driver takes
care of reverting the device to NMEA *after* the revert method has
been called.

The wrapup call is actually for reverting configurator actions that
tweak things  like the static-nav bit, altitude holding, or the DOP
threshold for declaring a fix invald.  Look at sirf.c::sirfbin_revert()
for an example.

&gt;<i> So far so good, but what follows next is what I see happen with my
</I>&gt;<i> code and I am not sure if it is the correct sequence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) If a client comes along, we then grab a new file descriptor (always seems 
</I>&gt;<i> to be fd = 5 for me) and issue a new probe_detect call. This succeeds (as it 
</I>&gt;<i> should).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6) gpsd_activate() now triggers a subtype probe again, but this time its 
</I>&gt;<i> arguments are such that it also triggers a configurator call. This latter is 
</I>&gt;<i> intended to set up any reports we need.
</I>
Correct.  The effects of the configurator call are what revert is supposed
to undo.

(I think these names are confusing.  Maybe I should change revert to
deconfigure.)

&gt;<i> The normal gpsd stuff happens now, but eventually the client gets bored and 
</I>&gt;<i> goes off line.
</I>
Still with you...
 
&gt;<i> 7) We now issue a revert call (if supported) to undo the work of the 
</I>&gt;<i> configurator call.
</I>
Correct.
 
&gt;<i> 8) We now issue a wrapup (if supported) to undo the work of the subtype.
</I>
I guess that's correct, though I don't think of it that way.  The TSIP
driver sets some serial parameters in probe_subtype that are undone in
wrapup.  This is the place for end-of-session work that has to be performed
whether or not the configurator was called.

&gt;<i> 9) We drop the file descriptor (maybe?) and sit idle again.
</I>
We drop the file descriptor yes.  No point in holding onto it 
with the device probe.

&gt;<i> 10) If the session is ended, the daemon is killed and exits. If a
</I>&gt;<i> client comes back, we go to step 5.
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> I am a bit surprised that we appear to drop the fd after the initial 
</I>&gt;<i> probe_detect or at least use a new one for the client (this is one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> differences I saw with the -n switch), but I was more surprised to see that 
</I>&gt;<i> the probe_detect is triggered again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had supposed that once we had determined what device was on a port
</I>&gt;<i> (at least for a serial port) we could assume that it will not be
</I>&gt;<i> going away?  USB might be different, but I haven't gone into that
</I>&gt;<i> (my device is serial port only).
</I>
USB is indeed different, and it's half the reason this architecture has become
so complex.  There could be a different device on the other end of the wire
named (say) /dev/ttyUSB0 each time we open it!

The other reason we sample packets on first open is so that users can find 
out from the daemon what kinds of devices are available.  Right now there
are two types, GPS and RTCM.  There could be others in the future.

&gt;<i> The multiple subtype and configurator calls seem reasonable as we might need 
</I>&gt;<i> to reconfigure the device for gpsd and undoing these changes when idling the 
</I>&gt;<i> device makes things safe.
</I>
Exactly.  The point of only calling the configurator optionally is to avoid
messing with the device settings when we don't have to -- notably, when we've
first opened it and are only trying to recognize it, not yet get data from it.
 
&gt;<i> Any advice or clarification would be welcome.
</I>
I hope this was useful.  What you're doing in documebting the driver
API is valuable and I want to support it.
