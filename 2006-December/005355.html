<PRE>Daniel Dorau &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">daniel.dorau at gmx.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Well, I don't know when that will be, but yes, sure. I have read that
</I>&gt;<i> Garmin spec Gary used in the meantime and the bad thing is that they
</I>&gt;<i> might have changed their protocol slightly as the above is correct
</I>&gt;<i> according to their (product specific) spec but obviously gives false
</I>&gt;<i> information on my unit. 
</I>
Then I shouldn't have tossed the old code so fast.  Instead, I should
leave it in, conditioned out.  Done -- I've added a comment explaining
that this is what the Garmin product spec says to do.

Which spec were you looking at, by the way? Is it the GPS-18 technical
spec Gary mentioned in the header comment? I'm looking at the
satellite-data packet description in the technical manual for the
Garmin 16/17 and it says nothing about the units.

And what's the model and firmware rev. of your unit?  That should go
next to your code.

It may turn out we have to branch to either of these depending on the
firmware version.

&gt;<i> Also that packet type which Gary extracted from the GPS-18 spec for
</I>&gt;<i> satellite view is missing from the official and more general protocol
</I>&gt;<i> spec of Garmin, so I'm currently clueless where to get my next educated
</I>&gt;<i> guesses from, other than to redo my parallel setup and stare at the data
</I>&gt;<i> a little longer until I get the next idea. (Or ask Garmin directly, but
</I>&gt;<i> honestly, I doubt they will right out tell me)
</I>
Where *is* the &quot;official and more general spec&quot;?

&gt;<i> Then we somehow need to find a way to find out how to enable DOP
</I>&gt;<i> information in the USB protocol since without that we're not able to
</I>&gt;<i> generate complete GPGSA sentences even if we figure out how that &quot;active
</I>&gt;<i> satellites&quot; status bits are coded.
</I>&gt;<i> (And they DO compute DOP values as they spit them out on the serial
</I>&gt;<i> port, so I bet they also do over USB if you ask it for)
</I>
I'd settle for generating sentences with empty DOP fields.
Better than nothing.

&gt;<i> Well, maybe I'll give it a try and send an email to garmin in the hope
</I>&gt;<i> that it'll reach someone that is at least able to understand what I'm
</I>&gt;<i> asking them about before they will dump it...
</I>
Go ahead.  I wouldn't expect a huge amount of luck, though.
