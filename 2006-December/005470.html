<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>   &gt; #if defined(__FreeBSD_) || defined(__NetBSD__) || defined(__OpenBSD__)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Excellent.  I'll check in the appropriate change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two trailing underscores in FreeBSD, maybe?
</I>
Clearly that needs to be fixed...I'll do it.
 
&gt;<i> But really this is gross to have OS-dependent switches in the code and
</I>&gt;<i> instead should be in configure, with a switch for the prototypical
</I>&gt;<i> device.  
</I>
I don't think having policy stuff at the top of gpsd is gross.  That's
what it's for, and the reason I've been so obsessive about the layer
separation between gpsd.c and the libgpsd library.

Yes, there's a case that identifying a 'prototypical' device ought to be
a job for autotools, but let's get this right locally before we try 
to push the job upstream.

&gt;<i> Also, I think it should be /dev/dty00 on NetBSD/i386, to
</I>&gt;<i> suppress carrier detect stuff (that's the dialout device).  But
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/ttydh00 on NetBSD/sparc64, at least on an Ultra5.
</I>
Why is the dialout device involved?  It's not like gpsd ever dials out.
No -- we want to be looking at the devices gpsd will actually read.

&gt;<i> This is going to result in 'wheel' for the group, which isn't all that
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable - really one wants to make a _gpsd group and then chgrp
</I>&gt;<i> devices on choosing to let gpsd at them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to avoid having to name a device.  One approach is to
</I>&gt;<i> use the first GPS device given, rather than the prototypical device.
</I>&gt;<i> Then the need to configure this is gone.  That interacts badly with
</I>&gt;<i> starting up with no devices and using the socket, though.
</I>
Yes.  You have just collided head-on with gpsd's design philosophy,
and lost the exchange.  Let me be very clear about why: the magic
words are &quot;zero configuration&quot;.

While the ability to specify devices on the command line is useful for
testing, starting up with no devices and using the socket is what the
hotplug agent does.  Supporting the hotplug agent comes *first*, because
the goal of the project is for an ordinary non-technical end user to be
able to just plug in a GPS and have all the right things (including
gpsd startup and GPS device discovery) happen automatically.

Proposed design changes that are incompatible with the zero-configuration
goal will be summarily, brutally, and rudely rejected.

You have just described a gpsd setup procedure that requires manual
intervention by a system administrator futzing with chgrp before gpsd 
is usable.  This is absolutely *not* going to happen. Fuhgettaboudit.

&gt;<i> For the pkgsrc case, one could certainly device _gpsd user and group,
</I>&gt;<i> and hard-code that.  Really the sysadmin will have to grant permission
</I>&gt;<i> to gpsd to use devices absent the ability to tell that serial ports
</I>&gt;<i> belong to GPS (and even then, really).
</I>
You're thinking like a sysadmin.  Wrong, wrong, *wrong*!

If you're feeling anal-retentive, go ahead and chgrp all your tty 
devices to a new group 'tty' or 'gpsd'.  gpsd won't care; it will
just go on doing its job, part of which is to make such interventions
unnecessary.
