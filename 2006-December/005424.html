&gt;<i> Given the warning, I thought I'd test on NetBSD.  2.33 runs fine from

</I>
There is a tarball at <A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/gpsd/gpsd-2.34.tar.gz.">http://prdownload.berlios.de/gpsd/gpsd-2.34.tar.gz.</A>
This is what I plan on shipping as 2.34

&gt;<i> Aside from sirfmom, it built with 'make' (BSD make).  There were a

It builds find with openbsd's make.

&gt;<i> number of warnings (I can supply the full list, but I presume everyone
</I>&gt;<i> else is seeing this), all about array subscripts:
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.c: In function 'gpsd_report':
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.c:164: warning: array subscript has type 'char'
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.c:164: warning: array subscript has type 'char'
</I>
Nope, not seeing this.

&gt;<i> sirfmon included curses.h, and then something which pulled in
</I>&gt;<i> ncurses.h, which caused vast failures.  I note that all the other
</I>&gt;<i> programs that use curses use ncurses.h and link with ncurses, so:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have a sirf to test, but with this all builds fine.
</I>
Keep that as a local patch - I'll adjust configure et al. after unlock.

&gt;<i> The other problem was that configuring like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>         CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/usr/pkg/include&quot; ./configure --enable-dbus
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> installed into /usr.  This is very ugly, requiring me to clean up
</I>&gt;<i> after this package put stuff in the base system where it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> belong.  Autoconf documented standard behavior is to put things in
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local if --prefix is not given, so gpsd's behavior is a serious
</I>&gt;<i> violation of the Principle of Least Astonishment.  README and INSTALL
</I>&gt;<i> both fail to mention this misbehavior.  I realize that on many Linux
</I>&gt;<i> systems people put everything in /usr, but this should still be only
</I>&gt;<i> programs managed by packaging systems, which are surely supplying a
</I>&gt;<i> prefix (pkgsrc supplies --prefix=/usr/pkg).  The following patch fixes
</I>&gt;<i> the problem:
</I>
I'm going to point the finger at autoconfuse... I build for test
purposes into /home/gpsd or /tmp/gpsd, and package into /usr/local,
and auto* makes files appear where I expect. By doing the install as
me, I'd see all kinds of failures to install because ckuethe (uid !=
0) can't write to /usr or /usr/local

Again, remind me after unlock. I'd prefer it if not every distro had a
half-dozen patches, so I'm happy to work with you on this, but it's
too late to start making changes this big...

&gt;<i> Starting gpsd with no arguments causes it to crash:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Reading the code, I don't see how report_mutex is ever initialized;
</I>&gt;<i> locking or unlocking an uninitialized mutex is documented to result in
</I>&gt;<i> undefined behavior.
</I>
patch added... i don't have the pps on, maybe that's why i never hit this.

&gt;<i> minor comments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> INSTALL commingles how to build the software and how to run it.  It
</I>&gt;<i> would be good to document building separately.  The prerequisites
</I>&gt;<i> aren't listed clearly.  It seems to be C++, pthreads, ncurses, and
</I>&gt;<i> optionally dbus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For running, the document talks about device permissions enabling read
</I>&gt;<i> even after gpsd drops root.  It doesn't say what uid it changes to,
</I>&gt;<i> and if it still needs to write, but then talks about group write and
</I>&gt;<i> the same group, but doesn't say if that's configured or searched for.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know the answers, but a few sentences of clarity would be
</I>&gt;<i> helpful.
</I>
drops uid to &quot;nobody&quot;, or &quot;_gpsd&quot; for the openbsd port&quot;

As to the documentation, I'll let Eric address that.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
