<PRE>I've applied the big patch and cleaned up a few minor issues.
Everything went perfectly smoothly, and all regression tests passed.  
Normal hacking may safely be resumed at this time. :-)

We're still in freeze for the coming release.  Gary has reported some
progress on his Garmin driver issues, and PPS seems to be working.

I don't think we're going to get test hardware from TNTC.  This means
we're going to have to ship with that support withdrawn.  Their loss.

Barring any last-minute bugs, when Gary tells us the Garmmin driver 
is ready to ship is when we'll ship 2.34.

The only other serious issue is that something in the combination of
gpsd and gpsfake is not happy.  TSIP logs don't replay correctly.
I'm counting on Chris to dig into that.

Meanwhile, having separated out the packet code so I can do it, I'm
going to experiment with some of the suggestions for packet-logging
formats Chris has been making.
