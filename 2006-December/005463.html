<PRE>
   I'm interested in integrating a gpsd feed with a wifi broadcast
  capability for my carputer.  What I'm thinking about is setting up a
  broadcast with a binary position message and broadcast it every second
  or so over the wifi.  I can then set up a listener to receive any
  others broadcasting their position information.  Does anyone on the
  list have any ideas for standards to start with?  I was thinking about
  using UDP but that would require the access points to sync up first
  (SSID+IP).  But, there must be a way to hack the wifi driver so that I
  insert a custom 802 beacon.  Any ideas?  I think a client like
  netstumbler with a link to a map is what is needed.

For this, you want to use IBSS mode, sometimes called 'ad hoc' mode.
On a BSD system: 'ifconfig ath0 media autoselect mediaopts ibss ssid
GPSD chan 6 -nwkey'.  To interoperate with others, it's necessary to
agree on a ssid and channel (and wep key; here none).

Then, you have to decide what kind of transport.  I'd choose a
multicast address and send UDP to it.  244.0.1.192 should do until
there's a real registration with IANA.

Then, you need to choose the content.  I'd be tempted to send bytes
that are a basic report from gpsd.  The other thought ss to send a
compact representation of all the information gpsd needs, so that the
listener can act as gpsd.

I wonder exactly what you're trying to accomplish at a higher level.
Showing the position of nearby cars on a map is neat, but I suspect
you'll be wishing for far more range than 802.11 will deliver.  With
high power cards and roof mounted antennas, you'll be in the
neighborhood of 100m - more in free space, less in traffic.

Before expending much effort, I recommend that you read about and
understand APRS: <A HREF="http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/aprs.html">http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/aprs.html</A>
