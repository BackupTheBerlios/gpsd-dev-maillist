<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> INSTALL commingles how to build the software and how to run it.  It
</I>&gt;<i> would be good to document building separately.  The prerequisites
</I>&gt;<i> aren't listed clearly.  It seems to be C++, pthreads, ncurses, and
</I>&gt;<i> optionally dbus.
</I>
In response to this, I have teaked the build machinery to degrade gracefully
if ncurses is not present.  A new paragraph reads:

    0. Prerequisites you will need to build the entire suite include C,
    C++, and pthreads. Python is optional; it's used for the test tools, but
    not for the daemon itself.  Support for DBUS is optional.  The ncurses
    library is also optional; if you have it, the build will generate two
    additional test clients.

I'm going to try to conditionalize pthreads and C++ so the daemon core 
will build without them.

&gt;<i> For running, the document talks about device permissions enabling read
</I>&gt;<i> even after gpsd drops root.  It doesn't say what uid it changes to,
</I>&gt;<i> and if it still needs to write, but then talks about group write and
</I>&gt;<i> the same group, but doesn't say if that's configured or searched for.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know the answers, but a few sentences of clarity would be
</I>&gt;<i> helpful.
</I>
Is this better?

    2. Ensure that device permissions will enable gpsd to read GPS devices
    even after it drops root privileges.  If you are running Fedora you
    can skip this step, as the stock configuration has the right properties.

    gpsd requires two things: (1) that GPS devices have group write
    enabled, and (2) all of them are owned by the same group.  It does
    not actually matter what group this is, as gpsd will determine that
    on startup by looking at a prototypical device (probably /dev/ttyS0).

    On a Linux with udev, check the files in /etc/udev/permissions.d to
    ensure that /dev/tty* devices are all created with the same group 
    and with 0660 permissions.

    When gpsd drops privileges, its default is to set uid to 'nobody'
    and group to the owning group of the prototype device.  There 
    is a configure option to change from 'nobody' to a specfied username.

    If your system has the Linux hotplug facility installed you can skip
    the permission-setting part; the hotplug scripts will force the
    permissions for you.  You still have to make sure all the tty devices
    are in the same group.
