  In response to this, I have teaked the build machinery to degrade gracefully
  if ncurses is not present.  A new paragraph reads:

Thanks - that helps a lot.

  [new permissions text]

That's much better.  I read some of the code and made the following
diff.  Some of this might be wrong, but I'm guessing that the
combination of me not knowing things and making a guess and you being
able to tell what I did wrong quickly will be helpful.

I realize what I said about group read/write is verbose, but on
reading your text I expected that if I did 'chgrp gps /dev/dty00
/dev/dtyU0' and then started gpsd with those two the right thing would
happen.  Instead, it seems it will look for /dev/ttyS0 (which it won't
find on NetBSD - that's a Linux name), but if it did it would use that
group.

Also, the source code seems to chmod g+rw the device files it opens,
but this isn't documented.

 On a Linux with udev, check the files in /etc/udev/permissions.d to
 ensure that /dev/tty* devices are all created with the same group
