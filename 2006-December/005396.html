<PRE>Guys,

I am trying to bring my driver into line with the latest version of the SVN 
(4094) and there have been recent changes to the methods and some splitting 
of information in the header files which have caused me a bit of head 
scratching.

What I need to know is a general flow of the start up, initialisation and 
shutdown sequences.

Here is how I think it goes, so please guide/correct me if I am wrong:-

==================================================================

1) If we fire up the daemon in -N mode with &quot;gpsd -N -D1 /dev/ttyS0&quot;, the only 
effect compared to normal operation should be that it does not go into true 
daemon mode (and doesn't drop privileges?) but otherwise behaves normally. 
Using the -N allows us to keep control over the code and allow easy exit when 
testing. The following sequence is somewhat different for me if I add the -n 
option to the above command line, but let's not go there just yet.

2) Right up front, we scan all compiled drivers in turn to see if they support 
the probe_detect call and trigger that entry point, using a free file 
descriptor (it always seems to be fd = 4 for me). If a probe matures, that 
driver gets the port and we stop checking further. If there are no probes 
supported or none of them responds, we will determine the device later by a 
port scan at different baud rates. That activity doesn't concern me here.

3) If we got a good probe, we then issue a subtype probe (if supported). This 
subtype probe should get the version data and maybe do some other good 
things. The arguments of the gpsd_activate() function triggering this call 
are such that there is no configurator call triggered at this point.

4) We then sit in a loop, waiting until we have detected a good packet in the 
main parser. When the packet type is known, because we have no users, we 
issue a wrapup call (if supported) to reverse the actions of the subtype 
probe and release the file descriptor (not sure about that?).

==================================================================

So far so good, but what follows next is what I see happen with my code and I 
am not sure if it is the correct sequence.

5) If a client comes along, we then grab a new file descriptor (always seems 
to be fd = 5 for me) and issue a new probe_detect call. This succeeds (as it 
should).

6) gpsd_activate() now triggers a subtype probe again, but this time its 
arguments are such that it also triggers a configurator call. This latter is 
intended to set up any reports we need.

==================================================================

The normal gpsd stuff happens now, but eventually the client gets bored and 
goes off line.

==================================================================

7) We now issue a revert call (if supported) to undo the work of the 
configurator call.

8) We now issue a wrapup (if supported) to undo the work of the subtype.

9) We drop the file descriptor (maybe?) and sit idle again.

10) If the session is ended, the daemon is killed and exits. If a client comes 
back, we go to step 5. Again, I always see fd = 5 when going to the 
probe_detect part.

==================================================================


I am a bit surprised that we appear to drop the fd after the initial 
probe_detect or at least use a new one for the client (this is one of the 
differences I saw with the -n switch), but I was more surprised to see that 
the probe_detect is triggered again.

I had supposed that once we had determined what device was on a port (at least 
for a serial port) we could assume that it will not be going away?

USB might be different, but I haven't gone into that (my device is serial port 
only).

The multiple subtype and configurator calls seem reasonable as we might need 
to reconfigure the device for gpsd and undoing these changes when idling the 
device makes things safe.


Any advice or clarification would be welcome.

Best Regards

Mick
