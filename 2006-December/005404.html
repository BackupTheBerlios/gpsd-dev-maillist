<PRE>Eric,

I am not trying to be obtuse here; I understand the concept that the fd is a 
resource that is handed out by the OS as and when we need it and that the 
absolute value is not really of any concern for us. My use of &quot;why don't we 
re-seize it&quot; was a bit unfortunate; I would have better expressed it as &quot;why 
don't we get the same one allocated to us again&quot;.

When I was observing the code (with lots of gpsd_report() stuff), what 
initially bothered me was whether we dropped the fd or not. I saw the same 
two (and only two) fd values being used over and over as I ran the code.

I understand now that we do drop the fd and the reasons why. However, it seems 
strange that we always get the same fd (actual value 5) on client 
activate/deactivate, however many times we cycle, yet the fd obtained and 
released when we made the inital probe (actual value 4) is not then allocated 
to the client.

It just looked as though maybe we were not really releasing it and I was 
thinking about hanging resources, etc.

I am prepared to take your word for it and accept that it is &quot;just the way it 
is&quot;.

Best Regards

Mick
