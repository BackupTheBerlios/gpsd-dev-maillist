<PRE>Greg, I appear to have missed whatever post you're replying to here.

Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;&gt;<i>As well as RTCM104_SERVICE where RTCM data from a DGPS device is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>available from gpsd on port 2101 from a serial port.  Has anybody
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>tested or worked on this recently?
</I>
Alas, no.  We haven't had anyone on the list who could test it.  It would
make me happy if that were to change.

&gt;&gt;<i>There's a new feature I'd like to see and that's the broadcast and listening 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of RTCM data on port 2101 over UDP.  RTCM data is from a serial port or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>another gpsd server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I have written my own rtcmd which does this, but it does not parse or check 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the data.  It just forwards the bytes around to and from serial devices, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>stdin/stdout, TCP client server and UDP broadcast/listener.
</I>
I would cheerfully build this into a future version of gpsd.
 
&gt;<i> At BBN we're doing something similar, currently with homegrown code
</I>&gt;<i> and I would like to migrate it in to gpsd. 
</I>
I'd love to have that patch.

&gt;<i> So, it would be helpful to post a design for how all this would work -
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be happy to review it and comment.
</I>
My vision is this: gpsd's job is to arrange rendezvous between a time-varying 
set of data sources and a time-varying set of subscribers.  

The data sources present as byte streams of unknown type, either from
hotplugged local serial devices or TCP/IP links such as NTRIP servers.

gpsd's first job is to deduce the protocol type of each stream.  Most
streams will just be GPS data.  These streams need to be made available to 
subscribers on port 2947.

Some streams will be DGPS correction data.  These streams need to be (a)
fed to attached GPSes, and (b) made available to subscribers on port 2101.
