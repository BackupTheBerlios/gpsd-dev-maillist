<PRE>Daniel Dorau &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">daniel.dorau at gmx.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Eric, no, this was a misunderstanding.
</I>&gt;<i> What I gave you as patch and what you already had checked in was ok in
</I>&gt;<i> my eyes. I had found out how that SNR value range is used in the USB
</I>&gt;<i> protocol and how to transform it to get values that correspond to those
</I>&gt;<i> we get over serial-NMEA.
</I>&gt;<i> This is _not_ documented in the spec Gary used, they only describe the
</I>&gt;<i> _packet structure_ in there for SNR values.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I had left untouched but was referring to in my mail as unclear and
</I>&gt;<i> what probably has undergone some change in meaning, was the way how they
</I>&gt;<i> code the status bits which describe which satellites were active, which,
</I>&gt;<i> btw. _is_ documented in that spec Gary used, but doesn't match the
</I>&gt;<i> observations I made with my unit.
</I>
Comments have been changed appropriately, thanks.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'd settle for generating sentences with empty DOP fields.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Better than nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also had that idea but have no idea whether this would be valid in
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA or not. Also we would have to somehow &quot;lie&quot; to libgpsd_core.c to
</I>&gt;<i> generate that sentence without DOP values because currently it wouldn't.
</I>
It doesn't matter all that much whether the NMEA is technically valid; 
raw mode is just a backward-compatibility hack anyway.  Feel free to
submit a patch that does this.
