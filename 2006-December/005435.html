<PRE>The good news is, it patches in and builds clean.

The bad news is, it's messing up the TSIP regression tests.
I think it's eating Trimble-shaped packets and falsely locking on to 
Navcom protocol.  When I configure with --disable-navcom the 
Trimble tests pass again.

Diagnosing this is going to be more difficult because our regression-test
infrastructure has problems:

1) There is some race condition in gpsfake that sometime causes
spurious failures.  The symptom is regression tests where it appears
that the last packet, or the last few packets, didn't get shipped
through to gpsd before the daemon terminated.  Lowering the
serial-line speed on the pty almost entirely, but not quite,
eliminates these.

2) If I build the regression tests on a 64-bit machine, they fail 
weirdly on 32-bit machines, and vice-versa.  Some of these divergences are
just round-off errors in the low-order parts of trig functions.  Some
of them are more disturbing, like fields that are NaN on 32 bits but not 64
or vice-versa.

Things are better than they were before I rewrote gpsfake to work
without threading. But they're still bad.  We do not, at the moment,
have regression tests that all our developers (32- and 64-bit) can run
with sure knowledge of what a good result looks like.  And this is 
*essential* to fix if we're going to be adding new code paths to
the packet sniffer.

Now comes the hard part.  Someone needs to take a swing at these
problems.  Someone other than me.

I've reached the point where I'm just thrashing when I try to tackle them.  
I'm getting very stale and frustrated, and I think I'm missing things
because I'm too close to the code.

I can make ssh access available on both 32- and 64-bit machines.

This is me yelling for help.
