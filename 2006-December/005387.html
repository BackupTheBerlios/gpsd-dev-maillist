Hi Jerry.

I've recently taken the TSIP driver under my wing, as the case may be.
A few points:

We're coming up on a release of 2.34; if you could please grab the
latest version from subversion and try it out, that'd be super. There
have been *lots* of changes since 2.32 and it could be that your
receiver might just work.

If you're not comfortable with the SVN code, please try 2.33. In 2.33
the TSIP driver just worked for me. I plugged in my Lassen iQ and
magic happened.

If your receiver isn't playing nice, I would be interested in having a
look at your logs. Minicom is how I usually grab raw traffic from the
port: &quot;minicom -8 -C tsip.cap&quot; and then point it at your device.

TSIP is a bit of an aberration, defaulting to 8O1, not 8N1. While gpsd
may tolerate the presence/absence of parity, the receiver is far more
picky. Personally, I'm rather annoyed that they went 8O1 - you can
change it with the windows tools, but that will lead to other
problems, like the driver expecting 8O1. Alas, we have no good way to
probe for parity, so we just expect the documented default parity
settings and hope the device hasn't been reconfigured.

I develop on OpenBSD, one of the NetBSD developers has recently
started hanging around here, and we're getting some more active OS X
users, so we should be pretty free of the &quot;all the world's a
vax^Wredhat i386&quot; syndrome.
