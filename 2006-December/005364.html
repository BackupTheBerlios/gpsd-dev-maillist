</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I don't know when that will be, but yes, sure. I have read that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Garmin spec Gary used in the meantime and the bad thing is that they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might have changed their protocol slightly as the above is correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; according to their (product specific) spec but obviously gives false
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information on my unit. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I shouldn't have tossed the old code so fast.  Instead, I should
</I>&gt;<i> leave it in, conditioned out.  Done -- I've added a comment explaining
</I>&gt;<i> that this is what the Garmin product spec says to do.
</I>
Eric, no, this was a misunderstanding.
What I gave you as patch and what you already had checked in was ok in
my eyes. I had found out how that SNR value range is used in the USB
protocol and how to transform it to get values that correspond to those
we get over serial-NMEA.
This is _not_ documented in the spec Gary used, they only describe the
_packet structure_ in there for SNR values.

What I had left untouched but was referring to in my mail as unclear and
what probably has undergone some change in meaning, was the way how they
code the status bits which describe which satellites were active, which,
btw. _is_ documented in that spec Gary used, but doesn't match the
observations I made with my unit.

&gt;<i> Which spec were you looking at, by the way? Is it the GPS-18 technical
</I>&gt;<i> spec Gary mentioned in the header comment? I'm looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> satellite-data packet description in the technical manual for the
</I>&gt;<i> Garmin 16/17 and it says nothing about the units.
</I>
Yes, the GPS-18 Spec: 425_TechnicalSpecification.pdf

&gt;<i> And what's the model and firmware rev. of your unit?  That should go
</I>&gt;<i> next to your code.
</I>
gpsd: Garmin Product ID: 292, SoftVer: 3.00
gpsd: Garmin Product Desc: GPSMap60CSX Software Version 3.00

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It may turn out we have to branch to either of these depending on the
</I>&gt;<i> firmware version.
</I>
Maybe. The more general spec you can get at
<A HREF="http://www.garmin.com/support/commProtocol.html">http://www.garmin.com/support/commProtocol.html</A> describes for some
devices which changes were made to which packets, so if we would get a
more complete spec from garmin than these both combined, we could do
this in a sane way. But as I said, I doubt they will tell us...

&gt;<i> &gt; Also that packet type which Gary extracted from the GPS-18 spec for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; satellite view is missing from the official and more general protocol
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec of Garmin, so I'm currently clueless where to get my next educated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guesses from, other than to redo my parallel setup and stare at the data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a little longer until I get the next idea. (Or ask Garmin directly, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; honestly, I doubt they will right out tell me)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where *is* the &quot;official and more general spec&quot;?
</I>
see above URL.

&gt;<i> &gt; Then we somehow need to find a way to find out how to enable DOP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information in the USB protocol since without that we're not able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generate complete GPGSA sentences even if we figure out how that &quot;active
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; satellites&quot; status bits are coded.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (And they DO compute DOP values as they spit them out on the serial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; port, so I bet they also do over USB if you ask it for)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd settle for generating sentences with empty DOP fields.
</I>&gt;<i> Better than nothing.
</I>
I also had that idea but have no idea whether this would be valid in
NMEA or not. Also we would have to somehow &quot;lie&quot; to libgpsd_core.c to
generate that sentence without DOP values because currently it wouldn't.

Regards,
Daniel
