<PRE>Eric,

Ok, your comments absorbed and implemented.

Now the story goes like this:-

1) Fire up with &quot;gpsd -N -D1 /dev/ttyS0&quot; as before.

2) Probe is found in the capability table for my driver, so a probe call is 
issued. My probe routine finds my device and reports this to the daemon. 
While doing this, it fiddles with the serial port, so it saves the original 
port data for restoration in step 5).

3) Subtype probe is found in the capability table for my driver, so a subtype 
probe call is issued. This sends a Device ID command which returns a block of 
data, including the software type. This is not actually trapped here, but I 
take advantage of the fact that we will now run the normal parser until we 
get a good packet.

4) We wait for a good packet, which will be provided by the Device ID command 
just issued. My driver checks to see if we have stored the Software info in 
the gps_device_t private data union and at this point we haven't, so it 
stores it and sets the DEVICE_ID flag. If this same command comes along 
later, we don't repeat this action.

5) Now we are done, since there is no client waiting for us, so we issue a 
wrapup. This restores any changes we may have done to the device (none in my 
case, since we haven't issued a configurator call) and restores the serial 
port settings from step 2) above.

6) If the daemon is terminated here, there is nothing to do relating to my 
driver, so only general housekeeping takes place.

=====================================================

7) If a client came along after step 5), we repeat steps 2) and 3), but extend 
step 3) to include a configurator call. This does two things in my driver; it 
checks some stuff like Position Hold mode and stores the present values in 
the gps_device_t private data union . It then programs the device with values 
that are appropriate to this (gpsd) use. These changes are guarded by flags 
in the gps_device_t private data union so that changes are remembered and 
once-only. These will be restored when we issue a wrapup call. We also 
activate the reports gpsd needs. These are cancelled when we issue a revert 
call.

8) When the client goes away, we issue a revert call, which switches off the 
reports.

9) We then issue a wrapup call. This inspects the flags and restores any 
parameters we have messed with. Finally, we restore the port parameters to 
the values saved in step 2).

10) Either a client comes back and we restart at step 7) or we kill the daemon 
off.

==========================================================

Apart from deferring the software version store operation from the subtype 
probe proper (which would involve writing some &quot;local&quot; parsing code) until we 
parse the reply normally, I think the above follows what you expect a probing 
driver to do.

If this is ok, then it will form the basis if the story I will be putting in 
one of the documents I am preparing that describe the various parts of the 
codebase.

=============================================================

When I have the above clarified, I will come back with what I get 
in &quot;gpsd -n -N -D1 /dev/ttyS0&quot; mode. This is different and I am not sure if 
it is doing what it should, but one step at a time.

I am also still not clear why we grab a new fd when the client comes alive. If 
we have released the original fd (used in the actual probe attempt), why 
don't we re-seize it? If we drop and reactivate the client several times, we 
always get the same fd. My expectation is that we should always grab the 
first free fd; especially since it appears from the client behaviour that we 
are not sequencing through the fds. Does this imply we are not really 
releasing the first fd properly or is something (unseen?) grabbing it?

Best Regards

Mick
