<PRE>  As well as RTCM104_SERVICE where RTCM data from a DGPS device is available 
  from gpsd on port 2101 from a serial port.  Has anybody tested or worked on 
  this recently?

  There's a new feature I'd like to see and that's the broadcast and listening 
  of RTCM data on port 2101 over UDP.  RTCM data is from a serial port or 
  another gpsd server.

  I have written my own rtcmd which does this, but it does not parse or check 
  the data.  It just forwards the bytes around to and from serial devices, 
  stdin/stdout, TCP client server and UDP broadcast/listener.

At BBN we're doing something similar, currently with homegrown code
and I would like to migrate it in to gpsd.  Our GPS hw is Novatel
Flexpak dual-frequency receivers with &quot;RT20&quot; corrections being
generated at one node and sent around to the other 4.  I'm not sure
this is pure RTCM-104 (it's hex encoded in something that's NMEA
like), but it might be.

We'll also need to add support for telling the reference station the
surveyed coordinates, and support for the novatel protocol; we need to
use a proprietary (but documented) format to get accurate output - the
RT20 differential corrections claim 20 cm.

Responding to another comment in the thread, local differential is
much more accurate than WAAS, because the unmodeled ionospheric and
tropospheric delays are far closer between reference and mobile.
Plus, on the US east coast, WAAS is very hard to hear in any
non-trivial terrain (other than airplane, completely open field).

The curious can see our reference station and mobile nodes:

So, it would be helpful to post a design for how all this would work -
I'd be happy to review it and comment.
