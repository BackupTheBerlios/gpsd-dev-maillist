<PRE>With 2.34 successfully shipped, here's my thinking about what happens next.

1. TEST INFRASTRUCTURE

We've got two new drivers in the pipeline, UBX and Navcom.  One
of these (Navcom) is already having some kind of collision with the TSIP
support.  This makes it urgent that we be able to verify that adding
support for new device types doesn't stomp all over our support for 
older ones.

This, our top priority has to be pounding the test infrastructure into
decent shape.  Following my call for help on this a few days ago, Chris
Kuethe has stepped up to take the lead on this, beginning with figuring 
out why regression tests build on 32-bit machines are breaking on 64-bit
machines and vice-versa.

2. NEW DRIVERS

Diego Burge has submitted a Navcom driver.  It builds OK, but 
conflicts with the TSIP driver at the packet-sniffer level.  This
needs to be fixed before we can ship it.

We also have an incomplete UBX driver which Chris will be trying to finish
and bring to production.

3. MAC OS X SUPPORT

Chris and I had to explicitly declare Mac OS X unsupported because of a 
bug in select(2) Chris found just before 2.34 release.  We've learned
that there is a Mac OS  X port called gpsdx and are looking into ways
to cooperate with the port maintainer more closely.

4. FULL PYTHON BINDING FOR LIBGPSD

This would be a useful thing in itself, but the immediate motivation is to
let us reuse some code in libgpsd_core.c for gpssim.  

Andreas Stricker: if you are willing to take on this project, you could
probably do it more efficiently than I.  

5. GPSSIM

I've be working on our GPS simulator prototype.  I'll have more to say 
about tha when we've swatted some of the issues listed above.
