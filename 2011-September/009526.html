<PRE>Dave Taht &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">dave.taht at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; What counts as stable?  Changes since 3.0 have been minor, mostly tweaks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the build recipe.  The biggest change I'm expecting in 3.2 is a bug
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fix to the old (non-kernel) PPS code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While there are several packages in openwrt head that pull directly from a
</I>&gt;<i> git commit of a given package, I would personally prefer that gpsd 3.x baked 
</I>&gt;<i> a little more
</I>
Dude, you *are* the testing on MIPS.  (We do have a couple or ARM devs.)

I hope you're at least a little reassured by the fact that the port required
exactly zero changes to C code.

&gt;<i> &gt;  I note that you will have to install the right kmod-serial-* to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get the right kernel support for your specific device,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Bu &quot;your specific device&quot; you mean the router hardware?  When we use that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phrase here we generally mean a make/model of GPS...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, I meant the make/model of GPS that we tested, which required a
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> opkg install kmod-usb-serial-ftdi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> in order for ttyUSB0 to be recognised by the openwrt/wndr3700v2 kernel. (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> documenting this for your future builds)
</I>
Ahhhhh.  Light dawns.

No, actually, it's not the GPS you have to worry about.  It's the USB-to-serial
adapter.  The GPS chipsets actually speak RS-232 natively; to turn them into
USB devices requires one of the adaptor chips.  FTDI is about the second
most common of these, the most common being a PL2303.

Sometimes the adaptor is inboard, sometimes it's outboard in a housing 
inline of the cable. This is why you'll often see two-piece cables with
the part coming out of the GPS ending in a mini-DIN connector; the mini-DIN
cable end it plugs into may have either a DB9 or USB connector on the
other end.

&gt;<i> I note many openwrt based devices have real serial ports, too. The wndr
</I>&gt;<i> actually has one inside it that can be hacked onto.
</I>
That's useful to know.
 
&gt;<i> saving any and all space on precious flash is in large part what drives
</I>&gt;<i> packaging for embedded firmware,
</I>&gt;<i> which is why I'd like to nuke the gpsd libusb dependency as it's only for
</I>&gt;<i> one rarely used device.
</I>
Reasonable. Just configure that driver out.

&gt;<i> &gt; I've added a force_global configuration option to force -G on for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deployments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like CeroWrt where listening only on loopback is not a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well... then it needs to be invertible somehow.
</I>
I could make that option invert the sence of -G, I suppose.

&gt;<i>                                 And the gpsd openwrt package
</I>&gt;<i> could merely have an option in the gpsd.config file to enable it where
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>
There is no runtime gpsd config file, by design.

 I can certainly see cases where lo can be used by other apps on the
&gt;<i> router and no other access is needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, full ipv6 support would be nice, too.
</I>
What does it need for IPv6 that it doesn't have? (-G support may be fixed now.)
