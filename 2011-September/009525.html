</I>
While there are several packages in openwrt head that pull directly from a
git commit
of a given package, I would personally prefer that gpsd 3.x baked a little
more
(with people testing on arm, mips, mobile devices, etc) and I am also hoping

However, I note that I am not in any way a gatekeeper to the main openwrt
feeds. Their requirements are different.

We (bufferbloat.net) spun up ceropackages specifically to enable those newer
to openwrt development and
embedded development to be able to use github as a base, and 'screw up'
freely while mastering the cross-development process, while not necessarily
being able to do builds on or for their own hardware.

Well, that, plus we wanted to try out some crazy things like a variety of
new test tools, multicast routing, using xinetd, etc.

A side goal is to get the developers of a given piece of software's heads
around how different embedded development can be, and also get needed
patches pushed up into those mainline packages.

It has been fun getting evan hunt (bind9 maintainer at isc.org) and your
respective heads around life inside 8MB of flash.

&gt;<i>  I note that you will have to install the right kmod-serial-* to
</I>&gt;<i> get the right kernel support for your specific device,
</I>
 Bu &quot;your specific device&quot; you mean the router hardware?  When we use that
&gt;<i> phrase here we generally mean a make/model of GPS...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I meant the make/model of GPS that we tested, which required a
</I>
opkg install kmod-usb-serial-ftdi

in order for ttyUSB0 to be recognised by the openwrt/wndr3700v2 kernel. (I'm
documenting this for your future builds)

I note many openwrt based devices have real serial ports, too. The wndr
actually has one inside it that can be hacked onto.

I note that adding a kmod-usb-serial-* depenendency to the gpsd package is
the wrong thing, as openwrt is more
like a 'distro to build hardware' distro, where the designer of the firmware
would pick and choose the right kernel
modules for their particular hardware.

saving any and all space on precious flash is in large part what drives
packaging for embedded firmware,
which is why I'd like to nuke the gpsd libusb dependency as it's only for
one rarely used device.

&gt;<i>                                                    and enabling the -G
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; option to gpsd allows you to contact the router remotely with tools like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cgpsd, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've added a force_global configuration option to force -G on for
</I>&gt;<i> deployments
</I>&gt;<i> like CeroWrt where listening only on loopback is not a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well... then it needs to be invertible somehow. And the gpsd openwrt package
could merely have an option in the gpsd.config file to enable it where
needed. I can certainly see cases where lo can be used by other apps on the
router and no other access is needed.

That said, full ipv6 support would be nice, too.
