&gt;<i> I can see why you'd want to support a large number of subscribers and
</I>&gt;<i> indexing them by their fd, but I really cannot see the argument for a
</I>&gt;<i> FD_SETSIZE sized list of GPS devices.  I would assume (yeah, I know...) 
</I>&gt;<i> that most people will do pretty fine with only one device.  
</I>
It was a philosophical choice -- no arbitrary limits in the program.

&gt;<i> But the gps_device_t structure is 14588 bytes, making the &quot;channels&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> array a whopping 14938112 bytes! No wonder I get ENOMEM...
</I>
Ouch.  I never did that calculation.  And, you know, I have to agree
that wasting 14 megabytes of core is a bit much just to remain
philosophically pure.

You write:

&gt;<i> I guess there is a reason for the 14588 bytes each GPS device will
</I>&gt;<i> occupy.  But is there really any reason to support more than, say, 
</I>&gt;<i> 4 devices by default? Could the size of the &quot;channels&quot; be reduced to
</I>&gt;<i> something more acceptable?  At least the MAXDEVICES should be a
</I>&gt;<i> compile-time option, making it adjustable without patching.
</I>
It already is a compile-time option.  What you're actually arguing
for is reducing the default.  

So let's think about that default.  The reference installation I
design for is a laptop user.  We can ask: what's a reasonable maximum
for the number of GPSes a laptop can physically hook up?

My Thinkpad X40 has two USB ports, which I think is typical these
days.  Let's say there's another GPS hanging off the serial port on my
extender, and a Bluetooth device as well.  That's 4.  A nice round
number in binary, and by coincidence the one you suggested.

You win.  I'll go change the default.
