<PRE>&gt;<i> heads up: i'm about to do a cleanup of the defines affected by
</I>&gt;<i> --{en,dis}able-sirfII.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) the product line is called SiRFstar
</I>&gt;<i> 2) i don't have any original SiRFstar receivers but my documentation
</I>&gt;<i> says the protocol remained mostly the same between SS1, SS2 and SS3 -
</I>&gt;<i> it just got richer as time went by. At least with my SS2 and SS3
</I>&gt;<i> receivers, this holds true.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) elsewhere in the code there are SIRF_THIS and SIRF_THAT, which
</I>&gt;<i> implies (correctly) independence of chipset version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, I am planning on changing sirfII references to either &quot;sirf&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sirfstar&quot;. a quick grep for SIRFII indicates there are a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> changes to make.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before I start: any objections or suggestions?
</I>
I agree with that.  The uBlox receiver that I used before was in fact
a Sirf I device but it worked with the Sirf II support in gpsd.
(enhanced with the packet 0x62 support that is uBlox-specific)

We can support all Sirf devices with one driver, because indeed the
functionality is mostly just widening and the older devices just don't
send the newer packet types.

One thing that sometimes caused me grief: the version string format really
is free-format and deriving a numerical version number from it and using
that to select driver behaviour is a dangerous thing to do.
It failed a few times on my receiver, when people again patched the logic
in the packet 0x06 handler to work with their receiver.

However, it now looks like the SIRF_xx_231 flags that are kept there are
no longer actually used anywhere.  They probably can be removed.
