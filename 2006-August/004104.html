<PRE>Hello,

I'm currently trying to get gpsd version 2.33 running on an embedded
MIPS platform with only 16 MB RAM (small &quot;router&quot; running OpenWRT). 

By default, gpsd will not run on this box (ENOMEM).  It will run if I
add swap, but since there is no harddrive (only flash) I'd really like
to avoid doing so.  A workaround seems to be

 swapon
 start gpsd
 swapoff

but that looks really ugly to me...

So I started looking for other solutions and found this in gpsd.c:

/*
 * Multi-session support requires us to have two arrays, one of GPS 
 * devices currently available and one of client sessions.  The number
 * of slots in each array is limited by the maximum number of client
 * sessions we can have open.
 */
#define MAXDEVICES FD_SETSIZE	

static struct gps_device_t channels[MAXDEVICES];
#define allocated_channel(chp)	((chp)-&gt;gpsdata.gps_device[0] != '\0')
#define free_channel(chp)	(chp)-&gt;gpsdata.gps_device[0] = '\0'
#define syncing(chp)	(chp-&gt;gpsdata.gps_fd&gt;-1&amp;&amp; chp-&gt;packet_type==BAD_PACKET)

static struct subscriber_t {
    double active;			/* when subscriber last polled for data */
    bool tied;				/* client set device with F */
    bool watcher;			/* is client in watcher mode? */
    int raw;				/* is client in raw mode? */
    enum {GPS,RTCM104,ANY} requires;	/* type of device requested */
    /*@relnull@*/struct gps_device_t *device;	/* device subscriber listens to */
} subscribers[FD_SETSIZE];		/* indexed by client file descriptor */


I can see why you'd want to support a large number of subscribers and
indexing them by their fd, but I really cannot see the argument for a
FD_SETSIZE sized list of GPS devices.  I would assume (yeah, I know...) 
that most people will do pretty fine with only one device.  

Now, this wouldn't have mattered much if the structure was small, like
struct subscriber_t.  With FD_SETSIZE = 1024, the &quot;subscribers&quot; array
is still only 24576 bytes.

But the gps_device_t structure is 14588 bytes, making the &quot;channels&quot;
array a whopping 14938112 bytes! No wonder I get ENOMEM...

Now, I have been reading HACKING and this section in particular:

&lt;quote&gt;
*** Don't use malloc!

The best way to avoid having dynamic-memory allocation problems is
not to use malloc/free at all.  The gpsd daemon doesn't (though the
client-side code does).  Thus, even the longest-running instance 
can't have memory leaks.  The only cost for this turned out to be
embedding a PATH_MAX-sized buffer in the gpsd.h structure.

Don't undo this by using malloc/free in a driver or anywhere else.
&lt;/quote&gt;


Which makes a lot of sense to me.  

But I believe such a policy should be followed by a really strict
&quot;don't allocate unneeded memory&quot; rule.

I guess there is a reason for the 14588 bytes each GPS device will
occupy.  But is there really any reason to support more than, say, 
4 devices by default? Could the size of the &quot;channels&quot; be reduced to
something more acceptable?  At least the MAXDEVICES should be a
compile-time option, making it adjustable without patching.
