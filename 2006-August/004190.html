</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm trying to set-up gpsd and (a customized version of) cgpxlogger on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TomTom ONE navigation system (the TomTom has an ARM processor, has a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sirf Star III GPS, runs Linux, and the navigation system is done by a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proprietary application).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> w00t. This is two people today hacking with gpsd on ARM boxen. This
</I>&gt;<i> ONE device sounds a lot like another... well, let's call it pretender
</I>&gt;<i> to the throne. Linux, ARM, SiRFstar, gpsd and proprietary nav app. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't suppose they're storing their database in SQLite are they? ;)
</I>
This device doesn't use gpsd by default and does not store the GPS data,
it only uses it for navigation. The maps are stored in some proprietary
format, I don't think it is based on SQLite.

This device has a lot of storage space (it uses a standard SD card for
storage, I have 200 MB free on mine), and I want to use this free space
to save the GPS traces in some usable format.

gpsd seemed like a good solution to me since it allows for multiple
clients: one for tracing, one for visualising the data in real time etc.

&gt;<i> &gt; I have a problem with gpsd losing the fix something like every one or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; two seconds. Launching cgps for example shows the fix is acquired for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one or two seconds, then the fix is lost and the values go n/a, then it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comes back again and again...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like fallout from our experiments with buffering policies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hacking the source I found out the culprit to be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          mask |= CYCLE_START_SET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set in nmea_parse.c:processGPGGA(). In my tests (look at the NMEA data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; below), 'gpsdata.sentence_time' is always one second before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'gpsdata.newdata.time'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I comment the CYCLE_START_SET line, the fix is no longer lost, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all seems perfect. This is with the latest SVN version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> you could try the --enabled-wired-policy option to configure... i
</I>&gt;<i> believe i saw a patch to cgps to send the j command to en-/dis-able
</I>&gt;<i> buffering. which accomplishes the same thing.
</I>
gpsd was compiled with the default configure value for wired-policy,
which is to enable it. config.h contains indeed 
	#define WIRED_POLICY 1

Or do you want me to test with the wired-policy _disabled_ instead ?

&gt;<i> If you want to test your logger, you can point it at gpsd.mainframe.cx
</I>&gt;<i> - it's a static test station I have set up and it's running with
</I>&gt;<i> --enable-wired-policy
</I>
Thanks for the information. Right now the logger doesn't do much but I
may enhance it a bit to add distance based logging etc.

Right now the logger is based on cgpxlogger, so it logs GPX data. XML is
a rather verbose format, is there a better - more compact - format for
logging ? (which can be easily translated to GPX or other standard
format later, using gpsbabel or a custom script) ?

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure if this is a bug in my GPS device or a bug in the code. My
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limited understanding of the NMEA protocol may be the issue...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've explained your nmea trace below. I guess this could be a bug, if
</I>&gt;<i> you define bug to be &quot;behaviour I don't expect&quot;.
</I>
Sure :)

Let me reformulate: the problem is caused by a 1 second difference
between two times: the &quot;sentence&quot; time and the time specified in the
GPGGA sentence. From the reading of the code, it is not clear to me what
the &quot;sentence&quot; time is supposed to be.

Based on what the &quot;sentence&quot; time is, this can be qualified as a bug in
gpsd, or a bug in the GPS device :)

&gt;<i> &gt; (FYI, I've kept in the log blow a few unknown sentences reported by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd. These are most probably not related to my problem...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not really related, but I'll give you the 25-cent tour anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $PFEC,GPint,GSA01,DTM00,ZDA01,RMC01,GLL00,VTG00,GSV05*3B
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: unknown sentence: &quot;$PFEC,GPint,GSA01,DTM00,ZDA01,RMC01,GLL00,VTG00,GSV05*3B\x0d\x0a&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $PMOTG,ZDA,1*2F
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: unknown sentence: &quot;$PMOTG,ZDA,1*2F\x0d\x0a&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $PGRMCE*0E
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: unknown sentence: &quot;$PGRMCE*0E\x0d\x0a&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $PSRF105,1*3E
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: unknown sentence: &quot;$PSRF105,1*3E\x0d\x0a&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are probe strings to determine what sort of receiver you have.
</I>&gt;<i> Some receivers ignore them, some will reply with $GPWTF ;) and others
</I>&gt;<i> will give you a distinguishable acknowledgement. I'm surprised that
</I>&gt;<i> $PSRF105 didn't identify the SiRFstar, because PSRF105 is enables
</I>&gt;<i> debugging mode. Enabling debug mode when debugging is already enabled
</I>&gt;<i> returns an OK message and that's how we fingerprint SiRFstar. Do you
</I>&gt;<i> know what version of firmware you're running?
</I>
If I believe what the nav application is telling me it could be v1.21

The reason why the GPS doesn't reply to probes is because I have not
used gpsd on the gps device node directly. Since I don't want to disrupt
the nav application (which reads on the GPS device), I make gpsd read a
named pipe created by the nav application and used by it to forward GPS
data to other programs). And the pipe device works in one direction
only, from the GPS to gpsd.

In a better world the navigation application would be free software, and
I could modify it to be a gpsd client. But we are living in an imperfect
world :)

Stelian.
