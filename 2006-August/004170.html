Paraphrase and you can take it however you like - that's the lovely
thing about paraphrasing.

There's nothing wrong with taking an interface or a technique that has
value on platform X and porting it to platforms Y and Z as well.
Things like RPC, NFS, YP all started out on Sun... now you're
hard-pressed to find a unix that doesn't have them. Think of POSIX and
you typically think of some kind of unix, but now there are even POSIX
interfaces for windows. SMB started out life on windows, now linux,
BSD and macs can use it.

I assume you take exception to my assertion that you should &quot;[obey]
the warnings of lint and cc because they know C better than you do.&quot; I
was alluding to &quot;The 10 Commandments of C&quot; which I shall reproduce
here for everyone's convenience. See also:

1 Thou shalt run lint frequently and study its pronouncements with
care, for verily its perception and judgement oft exceed thine

2 Thou shalt not follow the NULL pointer, for chaos and madness await
thee at its end.

3 Thou shalt cast all function arguments to the expected type if they
are not of that type already, even when thou art convinced that this
is unnecessary, lest they take cruel vengeance upon thee when thou
least expect it.

4 If thy header files fail to declare the return types of thy library
functions, thou shalt declare them thyself with the most meticulous
care, lest grievous harm befall thy program.

5 Thou shalt check the array bounds of all strings (indeed, all
arrays), for surely where thou typest ``foo'' someone someday shall
type ``supercalifragilisticexpialidocious''.

6 If a function be advertised to return an error code in the event of
difficulties, thou shalt check for that code, yea, even though the
checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy typing
fingers, for if thou thinkest ``it cannot happen to me'', the gods
shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance.

7 Thou shalt study thy libraries and strive not to reinvent them
without cause, that thy code may be short and readable and thy days
pleasant and productive.

8 Thou shalt make thy program's purpose and structure clear to thy
fellow man by using the One True Brace Style, even if thou likest it
not, for thy creativity is better used in solving problems than in
creating beautiful new impediments to understanding.

9 Thy external identifiers shall be unique in the first six
characters, though this harsh discipline be irksome and the years of
its necessity stretch before thee seemingly without end, lest thou
tear thy hair out and go mad on that fateful day when thou desirest to
make thy program run on an old system.

10 Thou shalt foreswear, renounce, and abjure the vile heresy which
claimeth that ``All the world's a VAX'', and have no commerce with the
benighted heathens who cling to this barbarous belief, that the days
of thy program may be long even though the days of thy current machine
be short.

&gt;<i> I have the following breaking while attempting to compile svn head from
</I>&gt;<i> right when this message is sent :
</I>
And thank you for reporting build errors. As I don't have dbus
installed, I'm not building gpxlogger. The unused variable warning
looks to be correct, and it seems that gpxlogger is not being properly
linked against libgps. I'll let someone with dbus (who can test the
fix) send a patch.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
