&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to set-up gpsd and (a customized version of) cgpxlogger on a
</I>&gt;<i> TomTom ONE navigation system (the TomTom has an ARM processor, has a
</I>&gt;<i> Sirf Star III GPS, runs Linux, and the navigation system is done by a
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary application).
</I>
w00t. This is two people today hacking with gpsd on ARM boxen. This
ONE device sounds a lot like another... well, let's call it pretender
to the throne. Linux, ARM, SiRFstar, gpsd and proprietary nav app. I
don't suppose they're storing their database in SQLite are they? ;)

&gt;<i> I have a problem with gpsd losing the fix something like every one or
</I>&gt;<i> two seconds. Launching cgps for example shows the fix is acquired for
</I>&gt;<i> one or two seconds, then the fix is lost and the values go n/a, then it
</I>&gt;<i> comes back again and again...
</I>
Sounds like fallout from our experiments with buffering policies.

&gt;<i> Hacking the source I found out the culprit to be the
</I>&gt;<i>          mask |= CYCLE_START_SET
</I>&gt;<i> set in nmea_parse.c:processGPGGA(). In my tests (look at the NMEA data
</I>&gt;<i> below), 'gpsdata.sentence_time' is always one second before
</I>&gt;<i> 'gpsdata.newdata.time'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I comment the CYCLE_START_SET line, the fix is no longer lost, and
</I>&gt;<i> all seems perfect. This is with the latest SVN version.
</I>
you could try the --enabled-wired-policy option to configure... i
believe i saw a patch to cgps to send the j command to en-/dis-able
buffering. which accomplishes the same thing.

If you want to test your logger, you can point it at gpsd.mainframe.cx
- it's a static test station I have set up and it's running with
--enable-wired-policy

&gt;<i> I'm not sure if this is a bug in my GPS device or a bug in the code. My
</I>&gt;<i> limited understanding of the NMEA protocol may be the issue...
</I>
I've explained your nmea trace below. I guess this could be a bug, if
you define bug to be &quot;behaviour I don't expect&quot;.

&gt;<i> (FYI, I've kept in the log blow a few unknown sentences reported by
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd. These are most probably not related to my problem...)
</I>
Not really related, but I'll give you the 25-cent tour anyway.

&gt;<i> gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $PFEC,GPint,GSA01,DTM00,ZDA01,RMC01,GLL00,VTG00,GSV05*3B
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: unknown sentence: &quot;$PFEC,GPint,GSA01,DTM00,ZDA01,RMC01,GLL00,VTG00,GSV05*3B\x0d\x0a&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $PMOTG,ZDA,1*2F
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: unknown sentence: &quot;$PMOTG,ZDA,1*2F\x0d\x0a&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $PGRMCE*0E
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: unknown sentence: &quot;$PGRMCE*0E\x0d\x0a&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $PSRF105,1*3E
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: unknown sentence: &quot;$PSRF105,1*3E\x0d\x0a&quot;
</I>
These are probe strings to determine what sort of receiver you have.
Some receivers ignore them, some will reply with $GPWTF ;) and others
will give you a distinguishable acknowledgement. I'm surprised that
$PSRF105 didn't identify the SiRFstar, because PSRF105 is enables
debugging mode. Enabling debug mode when debugging is already enabled
returns an OK message and that's how we fingerprint SiRFstar. Do you
know what version of firmware you're running?

&gt;<i> gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $GPGGA,210907.000,4852.5776,N,00223.0439,E,1,04,4.8,96.6,M,47.3,M,,0000*65
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: GPGGA sets status 1
</I>
Yes, that's good... you have a non-differential GPS fix from 4 satellites.

&gt;<i> gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $GPGSA,A,3,06,21,18,22,,,,,,,,,6.5,4.8,4.3*36
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd: GPGSA sets mode 3
</I>
Your GPS is in automatic mode, you have a 3D solution, PRN 6 21 18 22
were used, and not great DOP numbers. To be expected from only 4SVs

&gt;<i> gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $GPRMC,210907.000,A,4852.5776,N,00223.0439,E,0.00,307.53,240806,,*01
</I>
And the &quot;A&quot; is the important bit: your fix is valid.

&gt;<i> gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $GPGGA,210908.000,4852.5776,N,00223.0439,E,1,04,4.8,96.6,M,47.3,M,,0000*6A
</I>
And your cycle starts with $GPGGA

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
