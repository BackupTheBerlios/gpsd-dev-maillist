<PRE>Ed W &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">lists at wildgooses.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Note I didn't say that you could do without a scripting language for
</I>&gt;<i> some other tasks, only that the udev stuff currently appears to be
</I>&gt;<i> fairly straightforward to implement in C?
</I>
It might be.  What I'm not hearing, yet, is a good reason to accept the
additional maintainance costs and increase in expected defect rates
implied by moving that code from Python to C.
 
&gt;<i> I think the UDEV part is arguably &quot;necessary&quot; for a complete system, but
</I>&gt;<i> I can't think of any other currently python pieces which are necessary
</I>&gt;<i> to have a running gpsd service?  ie if you changed the udev piece then
</I>&gt;<i> python would be completely optional for many use cases (such as mine)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hence it would be desirable to have a non scripting piece here (or at
</I>&gt;<i> least limited to only posix shell)?
</I>
That depends on whether there is a significant class of deployments
that need hotplug but can't support Python.  I'm skeptical about this;
normally, embedded systems have hardwired ports and a set of sensors
that is fixed by the system integrator.

Do you have an actual use case like this, or is your objection theoretical?

&gt;<i> That said, if the most important goals were installation size,
</I>&gt;<i> portability and speed, then I think lua is a clear winner (low few 100KB
</I>&gt;<i> installation size and fast portable vm).
</I>
Agreed, despite some odd quirks like 1-origin indexing.  If lua had been
mature enough by around 2005 I might very well have a &quot;prefer lua&quot; policy
for this project rather than a &quot;prefer Python&quot; one.
