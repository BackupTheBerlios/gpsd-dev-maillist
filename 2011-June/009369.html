<PRE>Hi, mostly responded to this on -users, but just to bring that to your
attention and touch a couple of slightly oblique points:

</I>
It's possible we are looking at slightly different utilities? The one I
was looking at was the gpsd.hotplug utility, the core of which is arguably:
- Open Network socket
- Write &quot;add %s&quot;
- Read one line of response
- Close socket and die

If you had never written any C code in your life I would understand
about increased maintenance costs! But you are obviously very
experienced and all this code is already in gpsd to act as the server
side of the same conversation - I really would be surprised if someone
could string this utility out beyond a few 10s of lines of C including
comments?  (in fact surely gpsctl already does some of this?)

Quite possibly some refactoring would even allow it to drop out from the
existing server side code? (Keep the client and server in sync?)

I do like the idea of this potentially growing to be a larger gpsdctl
utility though. Although does it not make sense to extend gpsctl
instead? It would potentially make it trivial to (script) things such as
the watchdog requested on another thread?


&gt;<i> That depends on whether there is a significant class of deployments
</I>&gt;<i> that need hotplug but can't support Python.  I'm skeptical about this;
</I>&gt;<i> normally, embedded systems have hardwired ports and a set of sensors
</I>&gt;<i> that is fixed by the system integrator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have an actual use case like this, or is your objection theoretical?
</I>
I think &quot;embedded&quot; no longer means devices built and supplied to
customers as a complete end to end solution including installation?
These days it's very common to build custom distributions to serve all
kinds of needs from mobile phones, tablets, routers, and more

In fact I can't think of a common example of &quot;embedded&quot; where the system
is supplied with hardwired options and an installer to ensure it's all
working end to end?

I would suggest that two of the more common examples of &quot;embedded&quot; these
days are 1) phones/tables and 2) routers.  Both of these would be very
desirable to include gpsd (especially those with a &quot;mobile&quot; goal).

I think neither can be expected to be shipped to the customer with all
the peripherals connected, nor supplied in such a way that only certain
peripherals can be connected to certain ports?  Further both examples
would be expected to handle dynamic connection/disconnection of devices
in normal use

Reading the list archives you have users with wild requirements including:
- Reading GPS feeds for router on planes
- UAV devices running on tiny gumstix devices
- Ships logging NMEA feeds

GPS tracking is extremely hot at the moment and there are a number of
attractive commercial devices I have been following that are built on a
tiny budget and usually battery powered. I have no idea whether they use
gpsd, but from knowledge of the specs and prices of the devices I would
estimate that compiling C applications would be no issue, but python is
likely not an option


In summary:

1) Please consider returning to Python being an optional dependency for
non core parts of the project (logging, derivative uses of the gps
output, etc)
2) Opening a socket, writing one line and reading one line in response
seriously sounds so trivial that I'm clearly missing something (or more
likely we are talking cross purposes?) if you are raising objections to
moving that piece to a C based utility?

Thanks for your consideration

Ed W
