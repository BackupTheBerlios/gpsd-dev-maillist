Neither do GPS's (in general).

You need to probe the serial port heuristically to try and figure out
what device is on it (now where might I find some lump of code that does
roughly that...?)

My previous pitch was that you allow a new kind of probe code, ie ones
which look for things which are NOT a gps.  This makes the whole cascade
thing easier to crack, ie if it's positively a modem, then stop trying
to treat it as a gps and move on

One useful heuristic I noticed recently is that every modem I care about
(grin) uses a 9 wire serial port, ie it asserts the various control
lines.  No GPS (that I have access to asserts) these control lines.

Now, I definitely don't think those are absolutes.  I have a modem which
can optionally be put into 3 wire mode (but why would you?).  And I
would imagine that some high speed usb GPS devices would run in 9 wire
type mode?  However, it does seem to be a very strongly correlated heuristic

Kind regards

Ed W
