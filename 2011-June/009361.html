</I>
Note I didn't say that you could do without a scripting language for
some other tasks, only that the udev stuff currently appears to be
fairly straightforward to implement in C?

I think the UDEV part is arguably &quot;necessary&quot; for a complete system, but
I can't think of any other currently python pieces which are necessary
to have a running gpsd service?  ie if you changed the udev piece then
python would be completely optional for many use cases (such as mine)

Hence it would be desirable to have a non scripting piece here (or at
least limited to only posix shell)?

</I>
Every scripting language has pros and cons. Familiarity is at least one
of the best reasons to pick one over the other.

That said, if the most important goals were installation size,
portability and speed, then I think lua is a clear winner (low few 100KB
installation size and fast portable vm).  However, I don't see any
reason to change from Python for anything other than the udev part
(which I would argue is near essential)

Thanks
