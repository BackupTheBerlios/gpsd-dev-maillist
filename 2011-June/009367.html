<PRE>Python is much better than bash assuming you have the modules to support
everything.

For example, you would need stty or a lot of system programs with bash and
it works but it easily becomes messy going beyond ordinary linear scripting.

Generally Python just ends up gluing calls to binary together so except in
rare cases is more than efficient enough.  For a single fire routine that
doesn't have to sit there and do a conversation it is a no-brainer.  Even
the pull-push (device to pipe) is close to that of C.

(To merge another thread...)

Even for Embedded, I can generally assume Python, or for targeted systems,
you can refactor the python scripts to the minimal specific requirements and
port them to C, usually in an hour or two if python was not available.

One question would be Windows systems - Python is native on Mac (and
jailbroken iOS), and is generally available on all Linux.

My only worry about python and udev might be security issues.

I also want to highlight how I did webgpsd (and I'm trying to clear out some
final bugs before I try to merge my stuff into gpsd-ng - I haven't
forgotten, but only want to merge pristine code, and I'm running into the
same kind of hotplug issues on my embedded arm board).  Basically it has
only the listen/accept socket at 2947, and optionally others including a
unix socket. I use feeder scripts and programs to access the GPS devices,
one per device type (I also do sensors).  I feed a string with the
information into gpsd via that socket - if it has a specific prefix, it
knows it is NMEA so it can use the internal parser, but that could be a
javascript interpreter, or the J1850 interpreter I have for my motorcycle.
The advantage is all the usb, termios, probing, baud, setup, whatever is
moved outside of the core multiplexer/state engine and can be done in
python, though I have binaries for my 20Hz NMEA to reduce latency and CPU.

Were I to do it in gpsd-ng form, I would have the gpsd proper, then one or
more information source scripts or programs that would open, probe,
configure, then do a read/poll loop and send the decoded JSON to the gpsd
multiplexer input socket (no structures in headers!).  gpsd would then
decode (and maybe echo them to watchers) and save the state so inquires
could be delivered before new data comes in.  It would also make
prioritizing the &quot;best&quot; fix from multiple sources easier (weighing
staleness, DoP, DGPS, 2d/3d - that is another feature I need to push from
mine).  There would be some latency for time synchronization, but there
already is just in getting across the device interface.

</I>&gt;<i> because of the difference in downstream maintainance costs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would the advantage of a C binary be over folding the bash
