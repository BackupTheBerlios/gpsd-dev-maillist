<PRE>
The attached patch adds an option -y opt=val to gpsctl for setting a few 
device-specific parameters for motorola oncore devices.  The options are

-y poshold=lat,lon,alt

switch position hold mode on with given parameters. This mode improves 
timing performance for a stationary antenna. Note: N and E are positive (i 
attemped to make it parse N/S and W/E postfixes, but ran into trouble with 
scanf and 'E' after a double being treated as part of scientific 
notation). The altitude (in m) is in raw numbers, i.e. no geoid 
correction, for compatibility with gpsmon output.

-y poshold=0

switch position hold mode off

-y poshold=survey

enable the internal oncore position survey mode (10000 samples), after 
which it automatically goes into position hold mode

-y traim=limit

TRAIM (Time Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) is used to assess 
the quality of the timing solution.  Removal of bad measurements (SVs) is 
possible in position-hold mode.  limit (in us) is the alarm limit.  When 
given as a positive number, the module pps ctrl is set to only give a PPS 
pulse if the limit is not exceeded.  Minimum value is .3 us (which 
according to manual requires all 8 channels to have locks on satellites). 
At 1 us limit, 2 SVs are enough to detect and with 3 one bad can be 
removed.  Remark: with 3-4 SVs, the time solution sigma is ususally 
reported in the range 40-60 ns.  Timing with this sub-us precision will 
likely also require the sawtooth-correction.

With limit given as 0, the TRAIM is switched off and the PPS pulse always 
emitted.  With limit &lt; 0, the TRAIM is switched off, but the PPS set to 
only be emitted if at least one SV delivers time.

-y ppsoffset=offset

Shifts (delays) the PPS pulse by offset us (0 - 1 s possible).  Useful if 
several GPS receivers are connected to the same computer.

--

I'm not sure if the new -y option to gpsctl is the best idea.  I also 
dabbled with -p 0|survey|lat,lon,alt -q limit -o offset, but that felt 
less intuitive and consumed more command line option name space.

The actual formatting of the serial messages have been placed in 
driver_oncore.c Here, also the handling of the pps_offset response message 
was corrected from pps_delay.  (There is an oncore pps (negative) delay 
option also, allowing cable delay adjustment in the 0 - 1 ms range, not 
used.  The old naming was an mistake.)

The automatic mangling of the oncore TRAIM settings on gpsd startup has 
been removed.

Should one make gpsctl accept several -y options in the same invokation? 
Also for the -x option?

Documentation for the above (mail rehashed) to come if accepted.

Cheers,
H&#229;kan
