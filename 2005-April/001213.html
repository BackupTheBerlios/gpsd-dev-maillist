<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Maybe we can have per &quot;session&quot; debugging by putting debuglevel in there?
</I>
I've thought about that.  The problem is that debug level really is a
property of the entire daemon instance.  There are lots of uses of it
in gpsd.c that aren't tied to a device; if debug level were a
per-device property and it differed among devices, what would be the
right value for the main loop?

&gt;<i> NMEA now parses geoid separation from GPGGA.  Added a -D 3 mesage for
</I>&gt;<i> that data and calcualted separation. separation is in the gps_device_t
</I>&gt;<i> but not in the gps_data_t. gps_fix_t is all that processGPGGA has so
</I>&gt;<i> there is no good place to put the data.  I would move the separation
</I>&gt;<i> from the one to the other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I realized I do not have a GPS handy that uses that sentence...
</I>
Don't worry about it.  With SiRF-binary and Garmin drivers in place,
vanilla NMEA GPSes are an edge case now (as in, less than 10% market
share).  That kind of sucks on many levels, and wouldn't have happened
if the designers of NMEA had possessed clue one, but it does mean you
don't need to sweat stuff like this too hard.
