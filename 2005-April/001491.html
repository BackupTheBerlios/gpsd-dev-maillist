<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is what I found on the ntpshm.  Looks like the shared memory is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0700.  BTW, shmget() ignores the 0111 bits.

</I>
Well...  not really.
I copied the function that accesses the SHM from a test program included
with   the ntpd source (there was a remark in the head of the file but it
has now disappeared), and there it uses 0700.
In the source of ntpd itself the mode is specified as:

(unit&lt;2?0700:0777)

i.e. it uses 0700 for unit number 0 and 1 and 0777 for unit 2 and 3.

This is only the creation mode, which is used when ntpd actually creates
the segment.  When it is created by gpsd the mode will be what gpsd sets.

ntpd also uses setuid to lower the privilege (at first I thought it could
be a matter of using seteuid or setreuid), and I see no special tricks in
ntpd to switch back to root before accessing the segment.

It is possible to drop privileges and save the original values, and then
switch back again when required (with setreuid) but it is a bit of false
security: when using this method, an attacker could in principle do the
same thing in his shellcode.

Exposing the shm to everyone is not that big of a risk.  It is not like an
attacker can write an invalid time there and then have the clock set
backward.  ntpd will not step the clock based on information in the shared
memory!  it will judge the info, when it suddenly is off by a large amount
it will mark the clock as invalid, when it is off by a small amount it
will very slowly move the system clock to that new value.  When going
backward, this process is going so slowly that the clock never steps
backward, it will just tick slower until it is in sync again.

I am not sure why the shared memory behaves as it does on your system. 
Like you, I would expect that attaching it as root and then switching uid
would keep it accessible, just like a file.  I have not tested it here
yet, I'll try to build a current version.
But if it cannot be solved somehow, we could consider changing the unit
number to 2 or 3 (and update documentation for the ntp configuration).
