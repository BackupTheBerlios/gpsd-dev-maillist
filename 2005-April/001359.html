<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">ckuethe at ualberta.ca</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt;I have toiled through the dense thickets of ICD-GPS-200, and sirf.c
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;now includes code to extract a leap-second correction from 50BPS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;subframe data after 1 Jan 2006.  But I don't trust this code.  Here's why:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No sense in disabling it: decode it now, and just don't use it (other than
</I>&gt;<i> printing it as a regression test).
</I>
I'd have done that, but the only way I've found to get subframe data
also enables half-a-dozen other periodic messages.  As a result, we
take a substantial hit in the latency department -- suddenly we don't
get 1-per-second updates any more.  (sirfdemo.exe kluges around this
by jacking the baud rate to 57600).
 
&gt;<i> In light of assertion #1, I am not willing to say that I am certain my
</I>&gt;<i> decoder is getting it right. We could be making the same mistakes, as
</I>&gt;<i> 6 == ~2, but the subframe preamble was right, and our subframe 6's were
</I>&gt;<i> not received in the middle of a batch of subframe 2's.
</I>
Yeah. I noticed that.  I have to wonder if this is the same problem that is
producing my 242 values.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;4. After doing that inversion step, I have -- exactly once! -- seen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a wrong value come out.  11 seconds rather than 13.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen the Geodetic Navigation message say that UTC-GPS was
</I>&gt;<i> 12.9999997 seconds, not 13 seconds. Which is Wrong.
</I>
That looks like a rounding error.  I don't think a rounding error 
would produce 11 rather than 13.

&gt;<i> &gt;NOTE: to test, you will have to condition out the check near
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;gpsd.c:891 that disables subframe decoding before 1 Jan 2006 (earliest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;date at which another leap second might occur).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, you're trying for upcoming-leap-second detection too? Brave.
</I>
Just trying to get current leap-second, but disabling the check till
the end of the year since NIST and the Navy say the current offset
won't change before then.

Anyway, if you'd take a real close look at the code I'd appreciate it.
