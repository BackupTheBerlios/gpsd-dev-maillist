<PRE>&gt;<i> I think the new Y=&quot; syntax broke the xgps display of satellite w/ the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would have added the new parameters at the end.  Inserting it

</I>
Are we still sure we are using the right tool for the job?
I mean, issues like this are going to pop up all the time with a protocol
like this.  Sure you can add new parameters at the end, but even then it
is not certain that existing software will parse it correctly.  It depends
on how the software was coded.  There would at least have to be some spec
that says that clients should expect unknown items at the end of each
reply.
Basically for every change made to the returned data, all clients have to
be verified to see if they cope with the change.

When thinking about the issue of data validity, I thought the following
model would be best:
gpsd keeps a table of elements, each with associated timestamps, updated
by receiver messages.
the timestamps can be both system time (time of reception) and timestamp
sent by receiver (if available in the message).
all this data is just collected, and a client can poll it, subscribe to
receive regular messages at a specified rate, or to receive new data as it
becomes available (maybe at a specified maximal rate).
the client can specify if and what timestamps it wants included with the
received data.  each message to the client is just a list of tagged data
items with timestamps.  it can decide by itself what age of data it
considers &quot;valid&quot;.

To have the possibility to add new data items to messages without breaking
clients that were written before, I think the message format should be
improved.  The positional parameter system we have now is difficult to
extend and improve without breaking things all the time.  See what
happened to NMEA: every time a new item is introduced they had to add a
new sentence, and often sentences repeat information already present in
earlier-defined sentences.  This causes all kinds of ambiguity problems.
Having a flexible data structure that can be sent to the client and can
unambigously be broken down into the elements the client understands is a
big advantage for compatability.
And compatability is what you need when you want client authors to take a
protocol seriously (especially those outside a development group.  you may
be able to interest a map driving software author to add gpsd support at
one time, but few of them wil be willing to update their application for
every gpsd release).

Earlier I proposed XML as the solution.  It was considered to be too large
and too complex.  I only proposed it because it is a standard.  It is
possible to write your own standard.  This will please some people because
the result is smaller and it fits in their embedded system better.  It
will also mean other people need to do more work to implement the
interface, because they first need to implement a parser for the format in
their environment.
Embedded system authors can probably write an XML parser that is smaller
than the generic libraries that are available, and you have the best of
both worlds.

Of course embedded systems are growing larger as well.
I have a satellite TV receiver that has &quot;only&quot; 8M of flash, of which 6M is
available for code (remainder is for settings storage and bootloader).
In that 6M, a Linux kernel, busybox with a lot of commands, and a 3.5M
application is stored.  The application uses XML for most datafiles.
It is amazing how much can be put in 6M with squashfs...

There is always a tradeoff between very simple schemes that are compact in
implementation but have some limitations, and very flexible schemes that
have a lot of overhead.  As it is now, a change in the protocol risks
incompatability with an application that interfaces to gpsd but does not
use the library.

There is also the problem that some receivers/protocols provide more
information than others, and with a simple protocol there is the
temptation to limit everything to the least common denominator and either
lose information or add some &quot;raw mode&quot; that shifts the burden of parsing
the packets to the application again...
