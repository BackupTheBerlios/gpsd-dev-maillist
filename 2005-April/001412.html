<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The only other choice I see now is a dedicated file like ~/.gpsd for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config stuff, but I hate to make that leap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. Among other reasons not to do it is that we want to make the

</I>
I cannot imagine that a large application that supports libgps, for
example a wifi wardriving system, a radio amateur APRS program, or a road
navigation program, would want to get such service from libgps.

Especially not when it is clear that the information comes from sources
like compile-time options, locale settings, and dotfiles.
This would not work well in the standard end-user install that has
binaries compiled by the distributor, locales set by an install program
that (as we have seen) often assumes that locale is defined by language
choice, and a user that has not yet discovered that his home directory is
full of files he has never seen.

Besides, a large application will probably not only support libgps but has
other options, like direct talking to an NMEA device on a COM port.

Applications have their own &quot;edit-&gt;preferences&quot; menu where many things can
be configured and I think all programmers would put an option there to set
things like this.  The best you could expect is a three-valued setting
&quot;metric/impereal/libgps-provided&quot;.

Again, it would be worth considering when you could really offer
something.  But the method of determining preference is unreliable, and
the offered conversion is so trivial that an application programmer can
quicker code it himself than he can determine from documentation that it
is available in libgps and what mechanism is behind that.
