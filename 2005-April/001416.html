<PRE>&gt;<i> If you look at the original application gpsd was designed for (looong time
</I>&gt;<i> ago)then you will find that the GUI app had every desirable unit
</I>&gt;<i> available.
</I>&gt;<i> And every imaginable datum/elypsoid. Gpsd only deliverd the basic set, any
</I>&gt;<i> conversion was done in the application (mxmap/hugo).  As long as it is
</I>&gt;<i> documented what gpsd delivers, I don't care what it is. I simply convert
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> to my liking.
</I>
That is what my assumption was...

&gt;<i> So, if the library contained a set of converters, that would
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> a service. Then let the user choose fathoms or millimeters. Apps can
</I>&gt;<i> easily
</I>&gt;<i> have memory (many (most?) gpsd users have already configuration files).
</I>
That would be a possibility, but in this case the conversion is so trivial
that I wonder why there needs to be such a service in the library.
I mean, all these conversions are simply multiplications by a constant.
It will be more trouble for the application to find out what functions to
call to communicate conversion settings than to handle this in its own
code.

There are a lot of conversions that you could think of.  Like converting
heading from degrees to radians or to strings like &quot;NNE&quot;.  Or converting
location into Maidenhead locator.  But do they belong in a gps interface
library?

I think it is best to just return metric units (as that is what the GPS
already outputs in most cases) and leave any conversion to local units to
the application.  xgps could display both units at the same time or have
some gui widget (button) to select the units.
