<PRE>i'll give you a point that a dotfile is not the best solution for a
library; when i talked about configfiles i thought about xgps and not
gpsd. i think for a libgps or gpsd to be used widely the unit option has
to be passed at launch-time/lib.function-call
gpsd'd have to be connection-based-localised because you could have two
clients requesting different units..
compile-time is not a good option anyway because in binary-distributions
it's either ppl from the states or the rest of the world who's gonna be
unhappy/confused..
i also agree that the methods of determining the units is quite
unreliable.. i'd say it's OK for xgps but in no way for the daemon.

&gt;<i> I cannot imagine that a large application that supports libgps, for
</I>&gt;<i> example a wifi wardriving system, a radio amateur APRS program, or a road
</I>&gt;<i> navigation program, would want to get such service from libgps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially not when it is clear that the information comes from sources
</I>&gt;<i> like compile-time options, locale settings, and dotfiles.
</I>&gt;<i> This would not work well in the standard end-user install that has
</I>&gt;<i> binaries compiled by the distributor, locales set by an install program
</I>&gt;<i> that (as we have seen) often assumes that locale is defined by language
</I>&gt;<i> choice, and a user that has not yet discovered that his home directory is
</I>&gt;<i> full of files he has never seen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, a large application will probably not only support libgps but has
</I>&gt;<i> other options, like direct talking to an NMEA device on a COM port.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Applications have their own &quot;edit-&gt;preferences&quot; menu where many things can
</I>&gt;<i> be configured and I think all programmers would put an option there to set
</I>&gt;<i> things like this.  The best you could expect is a three-valued setting
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;metric/impereal/libgps-provided&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, it would be worth considering when you could really offer
</I>&gt;<i> something.  But the method of determining preference is unreliable, and
</I>&gt;<i> the offered conversion is so trivial that an application programmer can
</I>&gt;<i> quicker code it himself than he can determine from documentation that it
</I>&gt;<i> is available in libgps and what mechanism is behind that.
