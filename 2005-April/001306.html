<PRE>Gary E. Miller &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gem at rellim.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I fixed a number of places in gps_unpack() that were coredumping
</I>&gt;<i> or doing stange things to the data.  They used to be guarded by
</I>&gt;<i> the check for &quot;?&quot; on line 78.   I probably was a bit over zealous
</I>&gt;<i> but I think this is the right direction to move in.  When an =?
</I>&gt;<i> is seen that can be used to flag daat as now invalid.
</I>
Yup, I saw those changes.  They look good.
 
&gt;<i> Uh, oh, looks like we were both in the same file and went in
</I>&gt;<i> slightly different directions...
</I>
Don't worry, I was being careful about that.  We both touched gpsd.c
tonight but in different places.

&gt;<i> There is still an annoyance in the code that is probably a
</I>&gt;<i> show stopper.  When I cover my Garmin to kill the signle, this
</I>&gt;<i> is detected by gpsd, but the information is not being passwd on
</I>&gt;<i> to xgps.  At that point if I kill xgps and restart it then xgps
</I>&gt;<i> sees that no signal has been found.
</I>
I'm not sure quite what sequence of events you're talking about here.
When you say &quot;is detected by gpsd&quot;, what do you mean?  Does it ship
X=0 to the client?  You should be able to check this by telnetting to
port 2947, enabling watcher mode, and seeing what happens when you
unplug the GPS.

&gt;<i> Not sure how libgps.c is supposed to detect this condition.
</I>
It should see &quot;X=0&quot; coming up the pipe.  It's supposed to display
a status of &quot;OFFLINE&quot; when that happens.

&gt;<i>                                                              There
</I>&gt;<i> used to be timeouts but no more?  Maybe it would be best to let the
</I>&gt;<i> '?' fall past line 78 and let the switch clear the data valid flags?
</I>
No, there were never timeouts in the client that I recall.  I explicitly
want to leave clearing the validity flags up to the client code, so users
have a choice about whether their status flags contains cumulative or
this-update-only flags.
