<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it will often work with RS232-connected receivers, but not with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> USB.  But maybe things turn out better than that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not aware of any retail GPS with PPS output.  Would like to
</I>&gt;<i> find a cheap one.  With the buffering and time slotting in USB high speed
</I>&gt;<i> hubs I would wonder how good a pulse you could get over USB.
</I>
Locally a surplus receiver module has been sold cheap.  This is the
typical OEM module, a PCB slighly smaller than a credit card with antenna
connector and a header with serial signals.  It has PPS and 10 kHz.
Kits were sold with this module and an extra board with power supply and
RS232 converter.
It is a &quot;Rockwell Jupiter&quot; module.  Works with NMEA and a binary mode.
ntpd supports it directly.
Unfortunately it now seems to be out of stock.  See <A HREF="http://gpskit.nl">http://gpskit.nl</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> I am using an OEM GPS module (uBlox) connected to COM1 with home-made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RS232 converter and powersupply.  The offset and jitter reported by NTP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually is within about 0.5ms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could even be better with kernel support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Garmin GPS-18 only comes with PPS as a special order with no
</I>&gt;<i> connectors.  They claim their PPS is 1uS accurate.  Bizarrely they
</I>&gt;<i> output 0-5V and call it &quot;mostly RS-232 compatible&quot;.  Not exactly legal
</I>&gt;<i> RS-232 but one can often get away with that.
</I>
0-5V should normally be OK.  What can be confusing is the polarity.  RS232
drivers normally invert, so when they are omitted the signal is often
reverse polarity, and the software must account for this or else it is
looking at the wrong edge of the pulse.
RS232 risetime is going to be the limiting factor.  The receiver itself
usually is accurate to 100ns.  Apparently Garmin take some extra margin.

To keep the clock really accurate, a kernel service is required that
samples the system time inside the interrupt service routine that is
called when the status line changes.  In earlier kernels (around 2.0/2.2)
there was an easily applied patch that allowed this, and I think there
also has been a kernel module to do it.  But I can no longer locate it for
recent kernels.

What I have now is a user-process level handler.  It waits for the line to
change (there is an ioctl for that) and then gets the system time and puts
it in shared memory for ntpd.  Quality of the result depends on how
quickly the user process gets scheduled.  It runs at high priority and
with some special scheduling settings.

When the system is lightly loaded you get something like this:
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset 
jitter
==============================================================================
*SHM(0)          .GPS0.           0 l   13   16  377    0.000   -0.008  
0.003

i.e. much better than 0.5ms.  More like 10us.
during heavy load this sometimes increases a little, but I don't see more
than 0.5ms for the offset (jitter is less).

Unfortunately the ioctl is unfriendly: it requires a separate thread as
you cannot wait both on a select and on this ioctl in a single thread.
But gpsd is not keeping the line open all the time, and the thread has to
co-operate with that.  This makes implementation a bit more complex than
necessary.
