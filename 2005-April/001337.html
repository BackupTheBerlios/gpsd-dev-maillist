Nope.  Same results.

Yup.  You need to pick a policy, document it in the source, then the
rest of us can try to be consistent to that.

&gt;<i> 1. When a command returns ?, does that mean &quot;leave the corresponding

</I>
I would slightly prefer to clear the data out.  That makes it less likely
that a sloppy client might miss the flag meaning.  Reading invalid or
uninitialized data is a recurring issue with all code.

A smart client can implement a &quot;coast mode&quot; if it wants by keeping it's
own copy of prior data.


&gt;<i> So far I've opted for the first answer, leaving it entirely up to the

</I>
More important that gpsd is consistent than optimal.

Right now xgps is not seeing, or acting, on the flags right and is giving
bad answers.

&gt;<i> 2. What should a client look for to determine if a given field has valid data
</I>&gt;<i> in it?  The alternatives are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) The status flag in the 'valid' field.
</I>&gt;<i> b) Out-of-band value in the field itself.
</I>&gt;<i> c) Value of the mode field (e.g. MODE_NO_FIX means lat/lon is no good)
</I>&gt;<i> d) Age based on an associated timestamp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now xgps mixes a, b, and c.  This is too complicated.
</I>
Prolly best that gpsd stick to the spirit of NMEA.  That is to have
status flags/bits to denote invalid/valid data (a or c).  I could care
less whether (a) or (c) but only one should be kept around.  Since bits
are cheap these days I slightly prefer (a).

Timestamps (d) have to be in there somewhere.  If the GPS just stops
sending data an invalid condition can only be detected by a timer.  This
could be a privater time that then implements one of (a), (b)  or (c).

OTOH, debugging is easier with an out-of band value (b).  That way no
chance that an invalid data point slips by a sloppy client and be
seen by tthe user as seemingly valid.

So, being a belt-and-suspenders guy I would go with (a) and (b).

Once again, more important that gpsd is consistent than optimal.  Pick
something, document it, stick to it.
