&gt;<i> Basically for every change made to the returned data, all clients have to
</I>&gt;<i> be verified to see if they cope with the change.
</I>
This is the major reason libgps exists, so the gpsd protocol can be a 
private matter between the library and the daemon.
 
&gt;<i> gpsd keeps a table of elements, each with associated timestamps, updated
</I>&gt;<i> by receiver messages.
</I>
That's pretty much how it used to work.  I got rid of most of the timestamps
when I realized that what applications really want is a tuple in kinematic
space - a time/position/velocity tuple plus error estimate for each degree
of freedom.

As a result, the library interface is now *drastically* simpler.

&gt;<i> all this data is just collected, and a client can poll it, subscribe to
</I>&gt;<i> receive regular messages at a specified rate, or to receive new data as it
</I>&gt;<i> becomes available (maybe at a specified maximal rate).
</I>
Right now we spport querying for data and notifications in what is 
essentially real time from the GPS (watcher mode).

&gt;<i> the client can specify if and what timestamps it wants included with the
</I>&gt;<i> received data.  each message to the client is just a list of tagged data
</I>&gt;<i> items with timestamps.  it can decide by itself what age of data it
</I>&gt;<i> considers &quot;valid&quot;.
</I>
Good design thinking.  But timestamps for each subfield turn out not to
buy you anything interesting.  I know, I've been down this route.  It's
why I removed them.

&gt;<i> There is always a tradeoff between very simple schemes that are compact in
</I>&gt;<i> implementation but have some limitations, and very flexible schemes that
</I>&gt;<i> have a lot of overhead.  As it is now, a change in the protocol risks
</I>&gt;<i> incompatability with an application that interfaces to gpsd but does not
</I>&gt;<i> use the library.
</I>
But ultraflexible bg complex protocols have a special problem here.  They
introduce latency, which is bad because the value of fixes drops very
quickly after they're taken.  For many important applications, a delayed
fix is worse than none.
