</I>&gt;<i> Yo Andreas!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, boy, that confuses things.  You want &quot;en_US&quot; text but you want
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;de_CH&quot; measurement units?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is quite common amongst &quot;technical&quot; users.
They want untranslated text (because local translations often are
confusing), but they want to use the local conventions.
It is like installing an English version of Windows but setting
the national settings to your own country.

Unfortunately it is not that simple in many Linux distributions.
I use SuSE Linux 9.2 (a German development...) but it allows only
the selection of &quot;language&quot; in its graphical system management
program.  Based on the selection it sets these variables:

LANG=en_US
LC_CTYPE=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_NUMERIC=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_TIME=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_COLLATE=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_MONETARY=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_MESSAGES=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_PAPER=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_NAME=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_ADDRESS=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_TELEPHONE=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_MEASUREMENT=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_IDENTIFICATION=&quot;en_US&quot;
LC_ALL=

It is possible to override some of them in an &quot;advanced&quot; mode
in this program, but not LC_MEASUREMENT.  Of course you can override
it from many places but it should not be expected that the average
user would do that.

IMHO:
1. there should be only a single switch.  or is there a need for
expressing speeds in mph while measuring distance in meters?

2. it should be controllable by a gui widget in xgps.  probably the last
state would not be saved because that is difficult in Linux, but at
least it could be changed by a user that does not know about commandline
options or X resources (how many users know about X resources??)

If course I would vote for defaulting to metric units (that is what
the GPS outputs) but apparently we have to live with the fact that the
whole world knows how to convert feet to meters but the US people don't
know how to convert meters to feet.
