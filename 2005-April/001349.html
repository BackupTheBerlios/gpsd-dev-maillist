<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; While you are at it, it would be nice if gpspipe had an option to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; output in simple format:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; x|y|z|time string (in std `date` format)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when each valid sentence containing all variables flies past.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  (ie keep it in watcher mode)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should that be the current host time, the GPS time stamp, or either
</I>&gt;<i> selectable?
</I>
GPS time; keep the sampling source for the recorded data set consistent.
The user can always append the host timestamp themselves if they need
it, but they can't add the GPS time. (I take it you do not mean GPS-&gt;UTC
leap second corrections? even still I prefer GPS time as long as it is
notated)


&gt;<i> Which standard date format?  I find iso8601 easy to parse but
</I>&gt;<i> asctime() format easy on the eyes.  Or does that need to be an
</I>&gt;<i> ooption?
</I>
iso8601: 1981-04-05 14:30:30-05:00
asctime: Wed Jun 30 21:49:08 1993

Doesn't really matter to me as both will need string parsing which takes
about the same effort. But make sure asctime includes timezone as the
&quot;was it daylight savings, not, or GMT?&quot; is a nightmare when working with
old data, as in practice no one ever keeps good enough notes as they
should.


&gt;<i> I was also noodling on some other options.  Maybe a way to dump fixes
</I>&gt;<i> only every minute.  Maybe only dump [count] lines then stop.
</I>
For my field work, I want to log every fix precisely as it comes in and
that's it, no interpolation, skipping, %.Xf, or any 'smart' processing;
just q/a'd raw data presented in a nice way. I can do whatever post-
processing myself later if I want to. If there are resource
constraints it is nice to reduce to 30 second samples, 1024 records -&gt;
8.5hrs. [*cough* passing data to someone who uses excel]; with the 30
sec timer not touching the timestamp just as hitting the ped-x button to
cross a street tells it to act when the next cycle finishes, not
immediately. ?


cheers,
Hamish
