<PRE>If you look at the original application gpsd was designed for (looong time 
ago)then you will find that the GUI app had every desirable unit available. 
And every imaginable datum/elypsoid. Gpsd only deliverd the basic set, any 
conversion was done in the application (mxmap/hugo).  As long as it is 
documented what gpsd delivers, I don't care what it is. I simply convert it 
to my liking. So, if the library contained a set of converters, that would be 
a service. Then let the user choose fathoms or millimeters. Apps can easily 
have memory (many (most?) gpsd users have already configuration files).

If I would design gpsd today it would look diffrent internally (big surprise 
after so many years), but I would stick to the old principle in the protocol.
Only &quot;raw&quot; mode would never exist, and the word NMEA would be deleted from the 
protocol description. 

The conversions should happen in the client, even if its done by the library 
gpsd comes with. Then it is up to the application developer to come up with a 
policy of how they want to represent the data to their users.

Cheers,
Remco
