Dunno, just saying that gpsd can not blow off a large percentage if it's
current working systems.  If the breakage is justified then it needs to
be well documented with the workarounds.

</I>
Not so simple.  I was just digging in to the Slackware MAKEDEV script.
Looks like slackwre creats /dev/tty* as 666 root.tty.  So I am not
sure how the /dev/ttyUSB0 got created as 644 root.uucp.  My /dev/ttyUSB1
is 666 root.uucp.

I can change the perms on a system with a static /dev.  That will not
persist over a reboot on a devfs based /dev.  So there I am stuck
doing things to devfsd.  Maybe I can test it on a devfs system next week.

If some of my gps are group tty and some uucp can you handle that?

&gt;<i> I wouldn't recommend that on a distro that uses either udev to create
</I>&gt;<i> ttyUSB devices or hotplug to initialize them.  In the former case
</I>&gt;<i> fixing /etc/udev/permissions.d is the right thing; in the latter case

</I>
Dunno, never used a udev system, and avoid hotplug as much as I can...
Sorta burned by the abrupt entry, then exit, of the devfs.  Waiting to
see if udev sticks around a bit before makeing that jump.  Hotplug has
been through so many changes hard to know which way is up with that.
Getting one guys hotplug scripts to work with a different version is
a good way to kill an evening for no good reason.

So, I changed my /dev/ttyU* to 666.  Now I get a tinier bit further.

# ./gpsd -nN -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -D 4
gpsd: launching (Version 2.22)
gpsd: listening on port 2947
gpsd: changing to group 14
gpsd: running with effective group ID 14
gpsd: running with effective user ID 99
gpsd: opening GPS data source at '/dev/ttyUSB0'
gpsd: No USB serial drivers found.
gpsd: no probe matched...
gpsd: hunting at speed 4800, 8N1

For some reason it looks like it is not even trying to use the garmin driver...
