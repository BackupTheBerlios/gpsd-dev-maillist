No sense in disabling it: decode it now, and just don't use it (other than
printing it as a regression test).

And this can be reproduced with 2.3.1, 2.3.1ES and 2.3.2(unreleased).

In light of assertion #1, I am not willing to say that I am certain my
decoder is getting it right. We could be making the same mistakes, as
6 == ~2, but the subframe preamble was right, and our subframe 6's were
not received in the middle of a batch of subframe 2's.

&gt;<i> 3. My first cut spat out leap-second corrections with values of 13
</I>&gt;<i> (correct) and 242 (grossly incorrect) at random.  This puzzled the
</I>&gt;<i> crap out of me until I noticed that in an 8-bit byte, 242 = ~13.  I
</I>&gt;<i> inserted a kluge that inverts values above 128, but I'm not happy.
</I>&gt;<i> This probably means that either I or the SiRF firmware is messing up the
</I>&gt;<i> inversion step.  Perhaps the firmware is pre-inverting the data and
</I>&gt;<i> not bothering to document the fact!
</I>
ICD says that for many of the quantities you're working with, the Control
Segment will keep the parameters in the range -127..+127. So your inversion
is approaching the right thing to do.

&gt;<i> 4. After doing that inversion step, I have -- exactly once! -- seen
</I>&gt;<i> a wrong value come out.  11 seconds rather than 13.
</I>
I have seen the Geodetic Navigation message say that UTC-GPS was
12.9999997 seconds, not 13 seconds. Which is Wrong.

&gt;<i> NOTE: to test, you will have to condition out the check near
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd.c:891 that disables subframe decoding before 1 Jan 2006 (earliest
</I>&gt;<i> date at which another leap second might occur).
</I>
Oh, you're trying for upcoming-leap-second detection too? Brave.

      GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
