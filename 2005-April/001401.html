That we can handle.

That makes things work.  If a non-US person selects en_US for LANG
and LC_MEASUREMENT these are not good enough.

I had assumed that there was some way that distros like SuSE handled
internationalization.  You are makeing me think that no-one has solved
this yet.

&gt;<i> IMHO:

Probably gonna be 3 values: miles/feet, knots/feet and km/m

The airplane and boat people want knots because it make navigation easier.

&gt;<i> 2. it should be controllable by a gui widget in xgps.  probably the last

The problem is not just xgps, it is anything that uses the libgps.

&gt;<i> If course I would vote for defaulting to metric units (that is what

We could make it a compile time options.  Then the distro can decide.

This just gets deeper and deeper.  So, how about this in descending order
of priority:

	1. command line
	2. GPSD_UNITS environment var
	3. X resources
	4. LC_MEASRUREMENT
	5. LANG
	6. compile time default

The only other choice I see now is a dedicated file like ~/.gpsd for
config stuff, but I hate to make that leap.
