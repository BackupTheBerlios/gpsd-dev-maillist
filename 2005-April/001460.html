<PRE>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd at xs4all.nl</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you start gpsd first it will create the segment owned by the gpsd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user and ntpd is allowed to read it.  Even when it is run as another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> via the -u option, apparently it attaches the SHM segment before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> switching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By &quot;it&quot; in the second sentence I take it you mean ntpd.
</I>
Yes.  ntpd has an option -u username which will make it switch to that
user (apparently after initialisation).


&gt;&gt;<i> However, when you start ntpd first, it will create the SHM segment, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be owned by root, and gpsd will only be able to write it when it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also running as root (at least at the moment the segment is attached,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar to ntpd).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, your results depend on the startup sequence.  Careful writing of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rc.d script (the comments at the start) can take care of that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Building the uid switching into gpsd (so it starts as root, and later
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> switches uid) can also solve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which rc.d script?  The one for ntpd?  I don't offhand see how this could
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>
Well, I was referring to the Required-Start commentline in the header
of the rc.d/gpsd script, but now that I think about it again it will be
difficult to guarantee that gpsd will start before ntpd, without knowledge
about the contents of the rc.d/ntpd startup script.
Putting &quot;gpsd&quot; in the Required-Start of ntpd will of course do it, but I
think it is not a good idea to require changing someone else's init
scripts...

&gt;<i> I think in general we have to assume that ntpd will start first, since
</I>&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;<i> usually started at boot time while gpsd is usually started by hotplug
</I>&gt;<i> scripts
</I>&gt;<i> at run level 3 or 5.
</I>
Is a USB interface with hotplug the &quot;usual&quot; situation these days?
My GPS is on a COM port and gpsd has to be started manually or from
an init script, because there is no hotplug that would detect NMEA data
on a COM port and then start something.


&gt;<i> I think I like the idea of having gpsd drop privileges after creating the
</I>&gt;<i> SHM segment.
</I>
It would also solve problems with opening the serial port.
Just do not close it after you dropped privileges.  When you want to
shutdown the port, it is usually possible to set it to 0 baud and keep
it open.  But this may need some testing.
Of course it will either need configuration (like the -u username) or a
hardwired username that is assumed to be always existing or to be created
during installation...
