<PRE>I have compiled and started the current version from svn.

There seems to be an issue with the ecef_to_wgs84fix calculation.
The calculated altitude is wrong, I think the wgs84_separation has the
wrong sign.  When I change the addition of wgs84_separation into
subtraction, the result here (52N 5E) is OK.

There also is an issue that I have observed ever since writing sirf.c
(what is now called sirfmon.c) and using it on my receiver:
My uBlox receiver outputs both x/y/z and lat/lon/alt.
The latter is output in a manufacturer-defined packet (0x62).

In my sirf.c I have been displaying both, one normal and one bold, at the
same position.  One can often see the fields toggle between two values
because the results are not exactly the same (I think due to rounding).
But now, there is a bigger difference: 0x02 packets calculate altitude
above mean sea level, and the 0x62 packet has altitude above the wgs84
geoid.
So the output shown on the screen toggles between two values differing
about 45m.

I temporarily switched off the writing of lat/lon/alt in the packet 0x62
handling to better see the calculated altitude, but I wonder what the
general handling of this problem should be.
Maybe there should be more than one &quot;fix&quot; structure per receiver?
(but how to access them from the TCP socket?)
Or a single receiver could consist of 1 or more &quot;logical&quot; receivers that
can return different data?
Or maybe I should just forget about the data returned in packet 0x62, as
now seems to have happened to the 0x29 packet data?
