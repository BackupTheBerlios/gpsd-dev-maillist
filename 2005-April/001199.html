<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> gpsd keeps a table of elements, each with associated timestamps, updated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by receiver messages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's pretty much how it used to work.  I got rid of most of the
</I>&gt;<i> timestamps
</I>&gt;<i> when I realized that what applications really want is a tuple in kinematic
</I>&gt;<i> space - a time/position/velocity tuple plus error estimate for each degree
</I>&gt;<i> of freedom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, the library interface is now *drastically* simpler.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> the client can specify if and what timestamps it wants included with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> received data.  each message to the client is just a list of tagged data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> items with timestamps.  it can decide by itself what age of data it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considers &quot;valid&quot;.
</I>
&gt;<i> Good design thinking.  But timestamps for each subfield turn out not to
</I>&gt;<i> buy you anything interesting.  I know, I've been down this route.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> why I removed them.
</I>
But what about data that is not immediately related to a fix?
For example, when you want to include almanac data in the repertoire that
a client can request, you will find that it is sent much less frequently
than fixes, so an almanac data item can be older than a minute and still
be &quot;valid&quot;.
It would not be required to have timestamps on each subfield, but there
would have to be timestamps for each group of fields that a receiver
normally sends in a single message.  A position fix could be one such
group.  Satellites in view would be another, as would be a page of almanac
data.

&gt;&gt;<i> There is always a tradeoff between very simple schemes that are compact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation but have some limitations, and very flexible schemes that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a lot of overhead.  As it is now, a change in the protocol risks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incompatability with an application that interfaces to gpsd but does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use the library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But ultraflexible bg complex protocols have a special problem here.  They
</I>&gt;<i> introduce latency, which is bad because the value of fixes drops very
</I>&gt;<i> quickly after they're taken.  For many important applications, a delayed
</I>&gt;<i> fix is worse than none.
</I>
I have difficulty imagining a system where parsing a structured message
would introduce more latency than the typical 4800 bps async serial
connection or even the handling of bytes in the typical fifo-buffering
UART does.
Critical timing issues can be found in the handling of time data to
synchronize the clock, and you can see how much it jitters and varies even
without any message parsing involved...  but I don't think receiving a
message (that took 100ms to send from receiver to system) 1ms later will
disturb many clients.
Also, I think the overhead of the parse (both in terms of memory size and
precessing requirements) is over-estimated here.
