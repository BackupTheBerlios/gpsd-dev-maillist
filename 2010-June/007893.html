<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> so I was confused about sub-second timing, sorry - I assumed that time()
</I>&gt;<i> would act like time(3) just like it has since Sixth Edition.
</I>
Ah yes.  The hardware-option variability of float on the PDP-11 did
some odd things to the Unix API and we're still living with the
consequences.  I think internally Python time.time() is actually
implemented with gettimeofday(), which was a later BSD invention now
standardized.

The Python call is time(3) as it should have been rather than as it
actually was.  Guido also changed ctime(3) not to have a \n on the
end, another case of fixing the core Unix API that can trip you up if
you're not aware of the incompatibility.
 
&gt;<i> My comment about how synchronization works in terms of the input to gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> ending and when one expects output still stands.  I could search for the
</I>&gt;<i> magic value, but really we want either a sound synchronization scheme
</I>&gt;<i> with no arbitrary delays or a time that is long enough for any
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable system.
</I>
You're right, of course.  The problem stems from the way gpsfake operates.

First, it starts up a slave gpsd.

It puts an object representing the fake GPS (and containing the test
load) in a list of writers, associates it with a pty, then ships the
slave gpsd a message telling it to listen to that pty.  In our
regression tests there's only ever one fake GPS, and thus one sentence
source on the writers list, but there could be more.

Then it starts the test loop.  Each go-round through the loop steps to
the (single) source in the writers list and checks to see if it has run
to the end of its test load.

If so, the (single) source is marked for removal from the writers list.
If not, a sentence from the test load is shipped to gpsd over the pty.

CLOSE_DELAY seconds after the sentence source is marked for removal, it
is removed from the writers list.

At the end of each iteration of the test loop, if the writers
is empty the loop terminates and the gpsd instance is killed.

The problem we're seeing arises when the test loop terminates before 
ths slave gpsd has shipped the report on its last input sentence. This can
happen if we get the following sequence of events:

1. gpsfake ships the last test sentence
2. CLOSE_DELAY goes by
3. gpsd is killed *before having shipped the report on the last sentence*. 

It used to be this could happen because a single read crammed multiple packets 
into the input buffer and gpsd only popped them off and reported them one
at a time.  That's fixed now, so this has t  be a pure racve condition in the
processing of single packets.
