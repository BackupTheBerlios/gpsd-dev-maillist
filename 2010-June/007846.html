Although the patch has been reverted i suppose we're still tracking
this bug, as it might bite us again while we attempt other fixes...

In case you've missed it on #gpsd: Sanooj straced this bug back to
fake.py using packet_get() to grab 16 bytes and going &quot;wtf is this? go
away!&quot;.
Apparently, it assumes packet_get() will read a full packet in a
single call. It used to work as it reads from a log file (it no longer
does with the 16 bytes patch).

On the other hand, gps_poll (as well as the main loop design) assumes
packet_get() will never read 2 packets in a single call. It used to
work as well when limited to RS232, it does not with USB/BT serial
ports.
Finally, Remco recently found that the Linux kernel layer expects
packet_get() to read a full UDP datagram in one call. In theory, the
max data size of such a datagram is around 2^16 bytes; in practice, i
don't know what we use them for so i can't tell.

Anyway, packet_get is at least assumed to:
 - always read a packet in one go
 - never read 2+ packets in one go
In a packet world where LARGEST&gt;=2*SMALLEST, the packet_get function
cannot exist.

Overall, there seem to be too many different (and mainly silent)
assumptions made about the widely used packet_get. It probably can't
be as generic/ubiquitous as it is expected to be.
It shouldn't be too hard to fix though. The longest part probably will
be identifying what those silent assumptions actually are.


Cheers,
