<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; [Rob Janssen]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The issue is: a thread is created using the pthread library to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; monitor the PPS input, and when it finds it cannot do so (usually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; because the USB serial device does not implement TIOCMIWAIT). the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thread just terminates.  But it seems the pthread library closes the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; file descriptor in this case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is very strange.  As far as I know, pthreads will not close file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; descriptors on thread exit.  I looked at the code to try to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if the thread is exiting in some strange way.  It seem to only return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the thread function, so nothing strange there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is my thought as well.  I believed this code was entirely safe, until
</I>&gt;<i> someone found that it broke their gpsd which worked before it was added.
</I>&gt;<i> I only tested with oldfashioned serial ports (on UARTS) which implement
</I>&gt;<i> the TIOCMWAIT ioctl.  When the receiver provides no PPS pulses the thread
</I>&gt;<i> just gets blocked in the ioctl and does no harm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But people reported that with a USB-attached GPS the ioctl would return an
</I>&gt;<i> error, the thread will exit, and then the parent process somehow got no
</I>&gt;<i> access to the port anymore.   It could also be that the erroneous ioctl
</I>&gt;<i> somehow upset the driver, but I doubt that can happen (it just isn't
</I>&gt;<i> implemented so it returns -1 and that should be it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment I have no USB GPS to test with.
</I>
For what it's worth, I can confirm that the current version (svn 3259)
with PPS enabled behaves as expected with 2 USB GPSes attached on a
more-or-less vanilla FedoraCore4 Linux system.  When I last investigated,
the ioctl did indeed return with an error number (I forget which number,
but it seemed like a plausible one for a driver complaining about an
unsupported feature) and the thread left no bad side effects.

Of course, neither of these units provides a useful carrier detect
PPS signal via USB, so it's a somewhat moot point.
