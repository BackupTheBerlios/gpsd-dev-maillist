<PRE>&gt;<i> Not completely moot.  I think this means I can remove the PPS bug from
</I>&gt;<i> our list and re-enable PPS in the default build for 2.32.  We'll need
</I>&gt;<i> to keep any eye out for future problems in this area, though -- I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect there was actually a pthreads-level bug at the root of Rob's
</I>&gt;<i> original report, but who knows whether it's been fixed in the interim
</I>&gt;<i> or whether the circumstances that trigger it are just weird and
</I>&gt;<i> random?
</I>
I confirm that I have seen this problem myself, on my own system.
I have not reported it, it came from someone else and I setup a
configuration that reproduced it.  That included a USB serial port
device (borrowed) and one of my RS232 receivers.  I expect this to
be similar to some of the &quot;USB gps receivers&quot;, that actually consist
of a GPS chip with serial port and a standard USB serial port chip.

However, at that time (as explained in my recent message) I did not
understand at all what was really going on.  Certainly, nothing has
changed in the PPS-related code.  But maybe it was a completely unrelated
bug in the serial port handling, that got fixed in the meantime.

I could search the archives to find out who originally reported it,
and ask if it still occurs.
