<PRE>Dear Friend, 
  
My name is Mr.Hugo matine Benito,An Audit officer in&quot; LA CAIXA BANCO 
ESPA&#209;A&quot;. I am writing following an oppurtunity in my office that will be 
of imense benefit to both of us. In my department we discovered an 
abandoned sum of ? 12.5.Million Euro (Twelve Million Five Hundred 
Thousand Euros.) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers 
Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in 
the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 
31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You can read more about 
the crash by visiting this site which I got during my investigation; 
please try to go through the site . 
<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/">http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/</A> 
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his 
next of kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because we 
cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation 
to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. 
Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only 
daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the 
knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this 
discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided 
to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of 
kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent 
disbursement since nobody is coming for it . 
We don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as 
unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money 
remained after seven years the money will be transferred into banking 
treasury as unclaimed funds. 
We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, 
while the balance will be for my colleagues and me. I will visit your 
country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above 
once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me. 
Note this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you 
receive this letter, you should contact me at:- my email address :-
(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">hugomabinto at netscape.net</A> Please note that all necessary arrangement for 
the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalised. We will 
discuss much in details when I do receive your response. Thanks and 
waiting for your urgent reply. 
Mr.Hugo Matine Benito  
</PRE>
