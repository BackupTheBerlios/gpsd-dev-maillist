</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The issue is: a thread is created using the pthread library to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monitor the PPS input, and when it finds it cannot do so (usually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because the USB serial device does not implement TIOCMIWAIT). the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread just terminates.  But it seems the pthread library closes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file descriptor in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is very strange.  As far as I know, pthreads will not close file
</I>&gt;<i> descriptors on thread exit.  I looked at the code to try to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> if the thread is exiting in some strange way.  It seem to only return
</I>&gt;<i> from the thread function, so nothing strange there.
</I>
That is my thought as well.  I believed this code was entirely safe, until
someone found that it broke their gpsd which worked before it was added.
I only tested with oldfashioned serial ports (on UARTS) which implement
the TIOCMWAIT ioctl.  When the receiver provides no PPS pulses the thread
just gets blocked in the ioctl and does no harm.

But people reported that with a USB-attached GPS the ioctl would return an
error, the thread will exit, and then the parent process somehow got no
access to the port anymore.   It could also be that the erroneous ioctl
somehow upset the driver, but I doubt that can happen (it just isn't
implemented so it returns -1 and that should be it).

At the moment I have no USB GPS to test with.
