I saw Remko's reply on gpsd-dev a couple of days ago, but didn't see 
anyone else comment on the issue.  From memory, it is a problem with 
both the svn and release versions, although I'm now only working with 
the SVN trunk.  Remko claimed it was a problem with the parameters 
being created by libtool (and also reported the same behaviour error 
on his - presumably different - system, although he didn't get the 
link-time warning).  I'm happy to provide more info if you like - did 
you see my exchange with Remko on the dev list?

It shouldn't really need too much additional testing: it fixes a 
consequential bug in the quality of the output, and needs only 
code-reading (while considering the consequences of receiving an RMC 
sentence at any time after the first sentence in a frame) to prove 
that the fix should restore the intended behaviour to the code... 
things had just been left out (and one line put in that shouldn't be 
there).

Testing here the difference was clear: using a client program that 
hasn't changed its use of gpsd in over a year (repeated &quot;PAMVTQ&quot; 
queries), the behavior prior to the patch is an apparently broken GPS 
system... with the patch, it behaves normally.

Cheers,
Robin
