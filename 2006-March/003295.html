<PRE>Please forward this mail to the Directors of OSGEO.

I write on behalf of the GPSD project, on which I've been the lead
since September 2004.  We maintain an open-source monitoring daemon for USB
and RS-232C GPS devices, and associated clients and test tools.  You
can read all about our project at &lt;<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/">http://gpsd.berlios.de/</A>&gt;.

News of OSGEO reached one of our mailing lists shortly after it was
officially founded.  A couple of our regulars have suggested we
consider affiliating with OSGEO in some way, and nobody has demurred.
I'm open to this idea, and am writing to open a dialogue on how GPSD
and OSGEO might fit together.

What we would bring OSGEO is a well-established project shipping
mature and effective software for one important component of a
geospatial applications stack.  I believe we have the strongest single
concentration of talent in GPS-to-computer interfaces anywhere in the
open-source community.  Our software is in production use by several 
geolocation-aware projects including Kismet, GPSdrive, and roadmap.

Our needs, as a project, aren't too pressing.  We could use a small
amount of cash funding for buying test devices; for example, one of
our guys wants to build an open-source BIOS-flashing utility for GPS
mice and he knows he's bound to brick half a dozen or do of them
getting it debugged.  Otherwise we're pretty self-sufficient; we've
got a good crew and stable hosting space.

The main reason I'm interested in OSGEO is longer-term -- I think
it's generally good for the open-source community to develop mediating
organizations that give it more clout in conversations with vendors
and regulators and standards bodies.  That's a significant part of
what I was thinking about when I co-founded the Open Source Initiative
back in 1998.  

In our particular area, I'd like to see OSGEO get involved in
standards work on GPS-related stuff like NMEA 0183 and RTCM-104, at
least to the extent of pressuring vendors and governments to open up
these standards.

I'd like, and I think my developers would like, to see OSGEO grow
and flourish. If there's a way you think the GPSD project can help
that happen, let's talk about it.
