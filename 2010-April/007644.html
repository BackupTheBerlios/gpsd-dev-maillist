<PRE>H&#229;kan Johansson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">f96hajo at chalmers.se</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The recent fix for gpsmon eating 100% CPU has some problem:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For an oncore it works, quits with 'Device went offline' on gpsd exit
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For a garmin 18 lvc in nmea mode (no clue how to put it in another
</I>&gt;<i> mode), gpsmon quits after about 2s with: 'Read error from device' or
</I>&gt;<i> 'select(2) failed' (only seen once)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The 'select(2) failed' happens if gpsmon is started too early, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd is started, but has not found the GPS yet.  Also seen for the
</I>&gt;<i> oncore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For an EM406A (sirfstariii) in nmea mode (using -b), the problem is
</I>&gt;<i> the same as with the garmin.  In sirf mode, gpsmon works (= does not
</I>&gt;<i> self-exit after ~2s of operation).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the inconvenience,
</I>&gt;<i> H&#229;kan

That Garmin...USB or serial?  It might make a difference.

In order to fix the spin bug I had to take out a piece of code that made
gpsd tolerate zero-length read for up to twice the device cycle time.
Here's my explanation from the log:

   Fix the select()-spin bug on disconnected devices.
    
    Addresses Berlios tracker bug #14638: 100% cpu when Bluetooth gps device
    vanishes.  Also a couple of reports on the mailing lists.
    
    The underlying problem here was that:
    
    * Disconnecting a USB device causes reads from it to begin returning 0,
      in effect an end-of-file condition.
    
    * select(2) sets an active bit not on &quot;I/O is ready&quot; but on &quot;read would not
      block&quot; -- including the end-of-file condition.
    
    * Therefore, select() will spin any time its fd set includes a disconnected
      device.
    
    The fix is to check for a zero-length read explicitly and always take the
    device out of the active set when that happens.
    
    We were actually doing that here, but the test was defective in two ways:
    
    1. The check for a zero return from gpsd_poll(), indicating I/O error
       or zero-length read, needed to be *before* the check for full paccket
       rather than after. This effectively disabled it.
    
    2. There was a conditional arm in the gpsd_poll() code that made it ignore
       zero-length reads for up to a full cycle.  I think this may have been a
       fossil from long ago when I experimented with non-blocking reads on
       devices.
    
    The fix for the gpsmon spin bug is probably quite similar.  That's up next.

Your new bug is almost certainly caused by the analogous change in 
gpsmon.  The problem is that, the way select(2) works, we seem to be
stuck with a choice between two bad behaviors.  Either we keep going
on a 0-length read, in which case we're going to burn CPU, or we don't,
in which case it's going to be hard to be tolerant in cases where 
gpsmon/gpsd gets 0-length reads from the underlying device.

Here's the relevant patch for gpsmon.  That is, if you apply this it will
revert to the old behavior of continuing on a 0-length read.

diff --git a/gpsmon.c b/gpsmon.c
index 1bf988f..051c32c 100644
--- a/gpsmon.c
+++ b/gpsmon.c
@@ -169,7 +169,7 @@ static ssize_t readpkt(void)

     changed = gpsd_poll(&amp;session);
-    if (changed == 0 || (changed &amp; ERROR_SET) != 0)
+    if (changed &amp; ERROR_SET)
        return EOF;

     if (logfile != NULL) {

You might want to try applying that and seeing how the symptoms change.
