<PRE>Hi,

while I can understand that this is a major issue, in my opinion it would not be
good to poke application developers yet again to change their code, at least not
in a hurry.
So in my opinion the old struct should be kept alive for some versions to give
them enough time to migrate to whatever the resolution of this problem will be.
As COMPASS_SET is not in the struct yet, chances are really good that no
application wants to access it right now. So developers who want to use the
information should switch to the new approach to access the data, and developers
who are not interested in the data should be given enough time to switch. This
would also make sure I could upload the latest shiniest gpsd version to Debian -
we're too close to the freeze (yeah, its delayed, I know) to have yet another
major transition. Remember that I need to get KDE rebuilt for a soname change of
the library.

Out of the choices of how to fix the issue, I think that the blob with proper
functions to access it is the best way, but probably I'm just too used to code
in languages != c.

</I>
Before stealing a probably used member of the struct we should ensure its not
used by any client program. I could imagine that some developers did weird
things to parse NMEA on their own - yeah, ugly, but there is a lot of ugly code
out there which tries to talk to gpsd. I can investigate for that within the
known reverse dependencies of libgps in Debian, if it is of interest.


Cheers,

Bernd
