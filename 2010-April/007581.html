<PRE>Jon Schlueter is seeing a packet_test regression failure.
Here's his diff log:

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/jonschl/projects/gpsd-git'
make: *** [check] Error 2

The background to this failure is that as the packet sniffer is doing its
conventional state-machine thing on incoming data, it's also passing each byte
to a function called rtcm2_decode(), which calls isgps_decode(). This is 
because of:

 * 4) ISGPS packets. The input may be a bitstream containing IS-GPS-200
 *    packets.  Each includes a fixed leader byte, a length, and check bits.  
 *    In this case, it is not guaranted that packet starts begin on byte 
 *    bounaries; the recognizer has to run a separate state machine against 
 *    each byte just to achieve synchronization lock with the bitstream.

ISGPS is the data format used for raw GPS radio bit streams and for
RTCM2, the DGPS correction service.  What's happening on Jon's machine
is that the ISGPS state machine thinks it has achieved ISGPS sync
lock. It tells the lexer this, and the lexer thinks it has accumulated
a packet of type 14 - RTCM2

For me, it's

uname -m = x86_64
uname -r = 2.6.31-20-generic
uname -s = Linux
uname -v = #58-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 12 04:38:19 UTC 2010

I think that actually pins it down pretty hard.  It has to be the
i686 vs. x86_64 difference - 32 vs. 64 bits.  That's believable,
because the code that's going wrong is some heavy-duty bit twiddling.

Here's Jon's session log on his 32-bit machine:

The key difference is after line 36.  Zooming in on that part of the logs...

i686:
07270274: character '0' [30], new state: GROUND_STATE
Character discarded, buffer 18 chars =
ISGPS parity 0
ISGPS processing word 4 (offset -1076330956)
ISGPS residual -1076330932
07270275: character 'D' [44], new state: RTCM2_RECOGNIZED
Packet type 14 accepted 1 =
Packet discard of 1, chars remaining is 17 =
 9: SiRF WAAS version ID with bad length test FAILED (packet type 14 wrong).

x86_64:
4294967309: character '0' [30], new state: GROUND_STATE
Character discarded, buffer 18 chars = 
ISGPS syncing at byte 4294967310: 0x00000000
ISGPS syncing at byte 4294967310: 0x00000000
ISGPS syncing at byte 4294967310: 0x00000001
ISGPS syncing at byte 4294967310: 0x00000002
ISGPS syncing at byte 4294967310: 0x00000004
ISGPS syncing at byte 4294967310: 0x00000008
ISGPS lock never achieved
4294967310: character 'D' [44], new state: GROUND_STATE

This turns up one minor bug.  The long number before the colon in the
first line is supposed to be a chracter counter, but in test_packet.c 
it's never initialized and random. After fixing that bug, my log is:

x86_64:
00000014: character '0' [30], new state: GROUND_STATE
Character discarded, buffer 18 chars = 
ISGPS syncing at byte 15: 0x00000000
ISGPS syncing at byte 15: 0x00000000
ISGPS syncing at byte 15: 0x00000001
ISGPS syncing at byte 15: 0x00000002
ISGPS syncing at byte 15: 0x00000004
ISGPS syncing at byte 15: 0x00000008
ISGPS lock never achieved
15: character 'D' [44], new state: GROUND_STATE

And checking Jon's log, 07270274 - 07270260 = 14, so that's OK.

The key difference is what happens when the 'D' (character 15) arrives.
At that point, on Jon's machine, the ISGPS state machine thinks it 
has parity 0 and sync lock.  Mine is still trying to sync.

Stay tuned for the exciting sequel, &quot;The Purloined Character&quot;, which
I will inscribe after I have added some more instrumentation to the 
ISGPS code.
