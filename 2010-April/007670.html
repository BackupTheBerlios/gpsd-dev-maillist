<PRE>Greg Troxel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gdt at ir.bbn.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> It's rather easy to declare: &quot;We are now in freeze.  All proposed
</I>&gt;<i> commits need to be sent to the list and receive esr approval before
</I>&gt;<i> going in (or someone else's for esr changes!).  Everyone please test.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Then go at least 72 hours with only measured, clearly-bug-fix changes.
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of other projects do this.
</I>
Other projects don't have test coverage as good as ours. To be fair,
most couldn't manage it even if they had someone as fanatical as me
working on the test infrastructure - the constraints on what gpsd can
see make wrapping it in a really controlled environment much easier 
than, say, an application with a GUI would be.

The fact that our software *is* highly test-friendly speeds up the
optimum tempo of development a lot.  I'd rather improve our test
infrastructure than lock in procedures that I agree would be 
appropriate at a slower development tempo.  That's why, instead
of issuing more ukases about how to do things, I built flocktest
instead.

Right now, Chris and Gary are tossing commits back and forth tryying to
nail down a murky bug in 50BPS subframe handling on SiRFs.  They know
what they're doing and it would be deeply silly of me to require that
I sign off on all patches.
 
&gt;<i> A problem is that it feels unmotivating to test when you return to see 5
</I>&gt;<i> more commits after the 30 minutes it took to run the regression tests.
</I>
Well, that's going to happen when Chris and Gary are chasing an
important bug in subframe handling.  Or I'm responding to their plea
to reindent the codebase so the syle variations won't give them
headaches.

Just to demonstrate that we do in fact have some restraint :-), the
libusb rework in progress that I've been discussing with Gary and
Chris on IRC hasn't even been pushed to Berlios.  We really are in
feature freeze, even if the level of commit activity obscures that.
